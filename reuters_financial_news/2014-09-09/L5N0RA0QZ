ISTANBUL, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira weakened on Tuesday, responding to a study by Federal Reserve economists that suggested investors were underestimating chances of an early U.S. interest rate hike.

Turkey is especially sensitive to changes in global liquidity conditions because of its large current account deficit, which is financed with foreign capital inflows that have stayed strong during the long period of ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy. Any concerns those flows might slow tend to hit Turkish assets. Monday's study, by economists at the San Francisco Fed, found investors expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer and raise them more slowly than the makers of U.S monetary policy themselves.

The lira <TRYTOM=D3> weakened to 2.1794 against the dollar from 2.1660 late on Monday. Istanbul's main share index <.XU100> fell 0.2 percent to 82,035.64 points by 0711 GMT, compared with a 0.28 percent drop in the broader emerging markets index <.MSCIEF>.
