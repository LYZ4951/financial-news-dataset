KUWAIT, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Kuwait is suspending its offset programme, under which foreign investors set up joint ventures in training and technology transfer, to ensure it is not blocking outside participation in the economy, the Gulf state's finance minister said on Tuesday.

"We need to revise it," the minister, Anas al-Saleh, told Reuters, adding many international partners had advised Kuwait the programme was not very encouraging. "This is why we've frozen it to make sure it is not an obstacle for those firms to come in."
