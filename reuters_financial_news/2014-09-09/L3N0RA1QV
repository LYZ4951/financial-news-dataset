HANOI, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets declined by midday on Tuesday, led by the Philippine benchmark that retreated from a 15-month high on profit-taking.

The Philippine SE Composite Index <.PSI> dropped 0.8 percent as investors took profits after a 4.4-percent rise over the past six sessions and amid market expectations of monetary tightening. The Philippine central bank is likely to tighten policy for a fifth straight meeting to rein in inflation, a Reuters poll showed, but views are divided on which tools it will use. [ID:nB9N0ND01Z] "Local rates are expected to be raised by 25 bps, but mostly to offset inflation," said Manny Cruz, a Philippines-based strategist at Asiasec Equities, adding that the move is not necessarily negative to the stock market. Property firm Ayala Land <ALI.PS> led the decline, falling 2.89 percent from a more than 15-month high hit in the previous session. "We expect profit-taking in Ayala shares to continue until next week," Cruz said. The Philippines is now the region's second-best performer, while its price-to-earnings is Southeast Asia's highest at 21.55, compared with 14.02 of Singapore, the lowest. The city-state's FTSE Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> outperformed the broader market with a 0.31 percent advance, lifted mostly by banking stocks. Singapore, which is lagging behind the region's rising trend, is expected to pick up soon due to the favourable conditions of a low interest rate and positive outlook, said a Singapore-based trader with DBS Vickers Securities. All markets except Singapore and Malaysia have posted yields to date of more than 20 percent, Reuters data showed. Indonesia's Jakarta SE Composite Index <.JKSE> lost 0.71 percent amid expectations of potentially higher fuel prices after a cut in subsidies. [ID:nL3N0R61YE] But Indonesian shares have received net inflows from foreigners for four straight sessions, lifting the index to a record high close for the second time in a month. [ID:nL3N0R926M] Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> tumbled 2.2 percent on profit-taking after gains that lifted the index past a high of more than five years.  Malaysia <.KLSE> and Thailand <.SETI> were almost flat.
