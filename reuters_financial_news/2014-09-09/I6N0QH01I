MILAN, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Italy's Intercos has filed a request to list on Milan's stock exchange, the make-up company founded in 1972 said on Tuesday.

The group, which produces and sells cosmetics and skin-care products, said in a statement it would use proceeds from the listing to expand its business and to cut debt.
