WASHINGTON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Real Estate Investment Trusts are an "important source" of private capital for housing, although they can pose risks to the Federal Home Loan Bank System through their captive insurance subsidiaries, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday.

The official, Treasury counselor Michael Stegman, said in remarks prepared for delivery to the North Carolina Bankers Association that the Treasury had not taken a position on a regulatory proposal that would shut captive insurers out of the FHLB system. But he noted some benefits of their inclusion.
