OSLO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Norwegian life insurers should be permitted to use a so-called volatility adjustment when setting discount rates for their liabilities, the country's Financial Services Authority said late on Monday, adoption European regulations.

Insurers will also be permitted to take up to 16 years to adjust to some of the requirements in the new international regulatory framework, known as Solvency II, the FSA said. The moves, which will go on a round of public hearings before being sent to the Finance Ministry for final approval, will help insurers gradually comply with the stricter capital requirements.
