ATHENS, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Portugal is confident it will meet the fiscal targets it has set for this year and will stay on a course of reforms to make its economy stronger, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said on Tuesday.

"We will accomplish the fiscal targets of this year," Coelho told reporters after a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Smaras. "We will propose a budget for next year consistent with the objective to attain a 2.5 percent (of GDP) deficit." Portugal expects its economy to expand by 1 percent this year after exiting its bailout programme in May.
