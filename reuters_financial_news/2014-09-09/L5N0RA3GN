OSLO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Norwegian sports retailer XXL confirmed on Tuesday it plans to list its shares on the Oslo Bourse in the near future but said it would not raise cash for itself in the initial public offering.

Sources familiar with the plans have previously told Reuters XXL could be valued at up to 10 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.58 billion) including debt. The company declined to comment on its own valuation. [ID:nL6N0PC4BG] XXL's major shareholders will cut their stakes, but the company did not reveal how many shares would be sold or exactly when the listing would take place. Companies that list in Oslo typically announce their IPO details just days or weeks after formally declaring their intention to list. "It'll be in the near future," XXL's investor relations chief Tolle Groeterud said. "There will be a sale of existing shares only. XXL doesn't need to raise cash." Swedish private equity fund EQT holds about 60 percent of the shares, while Dolphin Management has about 30 percent and current and former employees hold the rest. "EQT became an owner in 2010. It's in their nature to have a four to six year perspective on investments like these," Groeterud said. Both Dolphin and EQT will remain key shareholders, the company said. XXL operates 39 large stores in the Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden and Finland, and plans to double this number across the region during the next five years. The company also operates an e-commerce platform. XXL's revenues grew to 4.01 billion Norwegian crowns in 2013 from 2.47 billion in 2011, while the gross profit margin has consistently remained around 40 percent. ABG Sundal Collier and Goldman Sachs International will be joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners in the IPO. Carnegie and Credit Suisse are joint bookrunners, while DNB Markets is joint lead manager.
