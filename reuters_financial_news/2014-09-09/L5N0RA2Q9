BUDAPEST, Sept 9 (Reuters) - A Hungarian court mostly rejected on Tuesday a lawsuit brought by the local unit of Belgian KBC <KBC.BR> to challenge a new law mandating refunds to clients on loans.

The first-degree ruling is open to appeal. Judge Maria Maka said some types of cost rises implemented in loan contracts this year met the requirement of fairness, however, in other cases the court rejected the bank's lawsuit.
