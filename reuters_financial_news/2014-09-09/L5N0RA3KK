JERUSALEM, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid said on Tuesday the shekel <ILS=> was still a little strong and ideally should be close to 3.8 per dollar.

His comments were originally reported by Bloomberg. "It's not something you can put an exact number on but it's around 3.7-3.8," Lapid's spokesman quoted the minister as saying to Bloomberg. "It's good for the economy and it's good for growth." The shekel weakened to new one-year low of 3.626 per dollar from its fixing of 3.6090. In July, it had reached a three-year high of 3.40 per dollar. Exporters, hurt by losing its competitiveness in the global market, have called for aggressive action to weaken the shekel. Exports comprise some 40 percent of Israel's economic activity.
