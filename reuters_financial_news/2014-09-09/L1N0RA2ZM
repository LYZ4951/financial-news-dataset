Sept 9 (Reuters) - Detroit and one of its last hold-out creditors, Syncora Guarantee Inc, have reached an agreement in principle over the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit bankruptcy, according to a federal court filing on Tuesday.

The city and the bond insurance company asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to suspend an ongoing confirmation hearing on the plan until Friday so they can "address certain conditions and logistics."
