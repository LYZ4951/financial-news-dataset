BERLIN, Sept 9 (Reuters) - German venture capital group Rocket Internet is set to unveil plans on Wednesday to float a stake of just below 15 percent in the company in an IPO worth about 750 million euros ($970 million), two sources familiar with the transaction told Reuters on Tuesday.

The move comes just a week after Zalando, Europe's biggest online fashion player that it helped launch, said it was aiming to raise more than 500 million euros by listing a 10-11 percent stake on the Frankfurt stock exchange this year. The companies join a flurry of e-commerce flotations set to be crowned by Chinese giant Alibaba <IPO-ALIB.N> next week. [ID:nL4N0Q32EL] Rocket Internet is bidding to create the largest Internet empire outside the United States and China. It wants to replicate the success of Amazon <AMZN.O> and Alibaba in markets the U.S. and Chinese e-commerce groups have yet to dominate, such as Africa, Latin America, Russia and other parts of Asia.
