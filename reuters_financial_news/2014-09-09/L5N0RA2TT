LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Catastrophe bond prices are expected to fall around 10-15 percent in 2015, ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday, below its previous forecast of a 15-20 percent fall.

The bonds, which transfer insurance risk between parties from an event such as an earthquake or hurricane, have been in heavy demand from investors searching for yield in a world of low bond market returns.  Some of that pressure was likely to ebb going forward, Kevin Lee, senior credit officer at Moody's, said: "We expect reinsurance prices to continue to decline next year but at a slower pace."  One of the two factors helping price falls to moderate was that funds that invest in insurance-linked securities (ILS) had seen returns drop and so had less scope to pressure prices lower, he said. Average catastrophe bond yields had dipped to 5-6 percent as a result of the influx of hedge and other fund money looking to compete with traditional reinsurers, Lee said.
