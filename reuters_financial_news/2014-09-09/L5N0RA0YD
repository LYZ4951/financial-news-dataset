COPENHAGEN, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The main shareholders in Denmark's ISS <ISS.CO> have sold 16.7 percent of the company's existing shares for $885 million, the catering and cleaning company announced on Tuesday.

The shareholders, private equity firm EQT, funds advised by Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan initially planned to sell 23 million shares in a bookbuilding process, but decided instead to increase this to 31 million shares due to "strong investor demand". At a price of 165 Danish crowns per share, the shares in the placement were sold at a 4.9 percent discount to Monday's closing price of 173.50 crowns per share. At 0720 GMT ISS' shares traded at 166.90 crowns per share, down 3.8 percent.
