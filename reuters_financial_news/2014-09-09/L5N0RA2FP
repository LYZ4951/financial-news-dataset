MOSCOW, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Russia's Finance Ministry said on Tuesday it was cancelling its weekly treasury bond auction due to "unfavourable market conditions".

This is the eighth straight week the auction has been cancelled, suggesting that demand for Russian bonds remains weak in light of the Ukraine crisis. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said on Aug. 20 that borrowing costs were too high to make bond issuance attractive, because of a "political margin". [ID:nL5N0QQ320]
