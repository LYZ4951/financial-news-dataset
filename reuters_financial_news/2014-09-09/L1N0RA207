MILWAUKEE, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Wisconsin prosecutors on Tuesday are asking a federal appeals court to allow them to restart an investigation into possible illegal coordination between Governor Scott Walker's campaign and special interest groups during elections in 2011 and 2012.

The investigation was halted in May by U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Randa, who ruled in favor of Wisconsin Club for Growth, which filed a federal lawsuit in an attempt to halt an investigation launched in 2012 by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, a Democrat. The conservative organization in February accused investigators of sidelining them from political activities, violating their rights to free speech, association and equal protection. Lawyers for special prosecutors and for the Wisconsin Club for Growth will argue the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Tuesday afternoon in Chicago.  Neither Walker, a potential Republican White House hopeful in 2016, nor anyone else has been charged in the investigation launched in August 2012 under a Wisconsin law that requires such probes to be conducted in secret. Walker was elected governor in 2010 and in 2012, two months before the investigation was launched, became the first governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. Walker was forced into a special election after he angered Democrats and labor unions by pushing through the state legislature a law that strips public sector labor unions of much of their power. In previously released court documents, prosecutors suggested Walker's campaign advisers gained control over both the funding and strategy of independent conservative groups, in what could be a violation of campaign finance laws.
