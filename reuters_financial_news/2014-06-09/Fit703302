June 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based  Power Finance Corporation's (PFC) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'BBB-'. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed PFC's senior unsecured  rating and USD1bn senior unsecured medium-term note programme at 'BBB-'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  PFC's ratings are equalised with those of India (BBB-/Stable). This reflects the  entity's public sector status, government ownership, and strong operational and  strategic ties with the government. PFC is, therefore, classified as a dependent  public sector entity under Fitch Ratings' criteria. The ratings also reflect  PFC's healthy financial performance and low delinquency ratio. PFC is one of two public financial institutions that provide funds exclusively  to the Indian power sector and is also the largest lender to the sector. The  government of India has also appointed PFC as the sole central agency  implementing several nationwide power reform projects aimed at reducing the  state power utilities' technical and commercial losses and improving their  operational efficiency.  The government owns 72.8% of PFC and provides PFC support by allowing it to  issue tax-free bonds. Being Infrastructure Finance Company, PFC can raise  foreign commercial borrowing of up to 75% of its net worth (including Foreign  Currency Loans outstanding) or USD750m without prior approval from the Reserve  Bank of India. Fitch expects PFC to continue to receive government support. The Ministry of Power signs annual memorandums of understanding with PFC that  set operational and financial performance targets. It reviews these quarterly.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India appoints PFC's auditors annually. PFC's capital adequacy ratio was 20.1% at end-March 2014 (end of the financial  year 2014), above the regulatory requirement of 15%. PFC's healthy profitability  is underpinned by its comfortable interest spread and lean operating cost  structure. Fitch expected PFC's net profit to increase by 20%-25% per annum  during FY14-FY16, driven by Fitch's forecast of 20% annual growth in outstanding  loans and the company's ability to maintain its interest spread at the current  level over the period. As at end-March 2014, 67% of PFC's outstanding loan portfolio was extended to  the state power utilities, which inherently have a weak credit profile.  Nevertheless, the financial performances of the state power utilities have  improved in the past two years because the government has raised electricity  tariffs and launched a financial restructuring package for the utilities.  Concentration risk arises from PFC's exposure to the power sector, with the top  10 borrowers accounting for around 46% of its total exposure at end-FY14.  However, this risk is mitigated by the guarantees from state governments for  part of the loans extended to state utilities, use of escrow accounts in the  case of state sector borrowers. In the case of private sector borrowers,  security is obtained through, among other things, trust and retention account  mechanisms, first priority pari-passu charge-on project assets, collateral such  as pledge of shares held by promoters, personal/corporate guarantees and the  critical role that PFC plays in providing infrastructure financing to its  borrowers.
