LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - Economic data over the coming six months will be key to deciding when to raise interest rates, Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty said on Monday.

Most economists expect the BoE will raise rates within a year, and some think that one or two policymakers on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee could vote for a rate rise as soon as August. McCafferty said in an interview with London radio station LBC that he wanted to see more data before making up his mind. "It's going to depend critically on how the economy performs over the summer and through the autumn," he said.
