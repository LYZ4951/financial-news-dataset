June 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

One year after Fitch Ratings outlined its concerns on  large loan U.S. CMBS deals, the primary worry has shifted from the quality of  the properties themselves to the amount of debt at the lower end of the capital  structure, according to the rating agency in a special report. While the quality of the properties in recently securitized large loan CMBS  deals has improved, Fitch's concern has moved to the overall level of debt in  the 'BBB-' to 'B-' rated tranches. 'Absolute debt is now where we feel extra vigilance is needed for large loan  CMBS and for lower rated tranches in some of these recent transactions there is  just too much of it,' said CMBS Group Head Huxley Somerville. 'Additional debt,  subordinate to the first mortgage, further amplifies our concerns as it raises  leverage even further.' Recent examples of this trend are in four large loan transactions that Fitch did  not rate because of the sizeable debt in tranches rated 'BBB-' and lower, which  the report details. The differences in ratings for these deals (two hotel  properties, one healthcare facility and one suburban office building) ranged  from one notch lower on 'AAA' rated debt to several notches further down the  capital stack. 'The amount of overall debt is sizable and while the loans may perform during  their term, very real risks will appear at refinance, leading to possible  defaults and rating downgrades,' said Somerville.
