HONG KONG, June 9 (Reuters) - China shares ended barely changed on Monday, with gains in property and finance counters largely offset by losses for a few index heavyweights.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended flat at 2,030.50 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also finished flat. Both failed to hold on to midday gains of more than 0.3 percent. Among the top index boosts in Shanghai, Poly Real Estate Group <600048.SS> climbed 4.1 percent, while top Chinese lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS> gained 1.4 percent.  Great Wall Motor <601633.SS> tumbled 5.8 percent as May sales, released late Friday, declined 16 percent from a year earlier.  Citic Securities <600030.SS>, China's largest listed brokerage, slid 1.1 percent after mainland media reported that one of its analysts disclosed insider information in a chat group. The company said on Sunday the matter was being investigated.
