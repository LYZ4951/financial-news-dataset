June 9 (Reuters) - Billionaire shareholder activist Carl Icahn told Reuters on Monday that the Family Dollar Stores Inc <FDO.N> poison pill is a "quintessential example" of attorneys "simply earning fees."

Icahn said the poison pill also "puts a damper" on prospects for a "friendly dialogue" with Family Dollar executives. Family Dollar adopted a poison pill to buy time to consider any possible deal that Icahn could push for after becoming its largest shareholder. Icahn said on Friday in a filing that he had a 9.39 percent stake in Family Dollar and said he was considering to push the $6.89 billion company for a merger with rival Dollar General Corp <DG.N>. "The poison pill especially in this case is a quintessential example of attorneys simply earning fees - how does it possibly help shareholders by putting a pill in?" Icahn said.
