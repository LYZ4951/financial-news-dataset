MILAN, June 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> closed up 20 percent on Monday at 1.848 euros after launching a 5 billion euro ($6.8 billion) share sale, according to Reuters data.

The shares had failed to trade throughout the session until the close but they had been indicated higher. The bailed-out lender is launching the massive rights issue to help repay state aid and bolster its finances. [nL5N0OQ1TU]
