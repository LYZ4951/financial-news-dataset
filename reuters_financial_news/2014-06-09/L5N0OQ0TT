MILAN, June 9 (Reuters) - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> said the Italian treasury will let it delay interest payments on state loans in light of a 5-billion-euro ($6.81 billion)share issue that  starts on Monday.

Loss-making Monte dei Paschi, Italy's third-largest bank by branches, is raising cash to partly repay state aid worth 4.1 billion euros it received last year after it was hit by the euro zone crisis and a derivatives scandal.
