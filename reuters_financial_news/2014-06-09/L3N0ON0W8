HONG KONG, June 9 (Reuters) - Guard Capital Management, a hedge fund start-up by two top traders formerly with Goldman Sachs and Noble Group, is aiming to launch next month and has hired at least four executives, one person with knowledge of the matter said.

Bin Gao, a former BofA Merrill Lynch rates strategist, has joined as head of strategy. Sean Giefing, who worked at Nomura Holdings <8604.T> in London as well as hedge fund BlueCrest, will head the trading team, the person added. The start-up capital of the fund was not immediately clear, the person said, declining to be named as the matter remained confidential.
