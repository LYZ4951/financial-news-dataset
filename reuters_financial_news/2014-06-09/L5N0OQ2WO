DUBAI, June 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Finance has seized some land in the country's capital from the kingdom's former telecom monopoly Saudi Telecom Co <7010.SE> (STC), a bourse filing said on Monday.

The 1.05 million square metre plot in Riyadh has a book value of 105.3 million riyals ($28.1 million), but the government has yet to tell STC what compensation it will receive for this land, the statement said. The compensation level and financial impact will be disclosed at a later date, the statement added. The government owns 70 percent of STC.
