LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - Ukrainian debt insurance costs fell on Monday to their lowest since Jan. 21 after the weekend swearing-in of a new president raised hopes that tensions with Russia could ease after more than six months of turmoil.

Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) fell 26 basis points from Friday's close to 741 bps, having tumbled more than 100 bps since the end of May, according to data from Markit. Ukraine's newly elected President Petro Poroshenko was inaugurated on the weekend in Kiev. He proposed a ceasefire with pro-Russia rebels in the east of the country and, as Kiev and Moscow resumed gas supply talks, hopes have grown that a full-blown military conflict has been averted [ID:nL5N0OP081] "It's connected with the inauguration of Poroshenko on the weekend. He has voiced a plan to resolve the problems and markets are reacting to that," said Tatiana Orlova, a strategist at RBS in London. "Also, the Russian ambassador who was recalled from Kiev a few months ago attended the inauguration and this is a hopeful sign and markets are viewing it positively."
