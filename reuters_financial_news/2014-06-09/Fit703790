June 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned RAKFUNDING CAYMAN LTD's  (RAKFUNDING) USD1bn guaranteed euro medium term note (EMTN) programme expected  Long- and Short-Term Ratings of 'BBB+(EXP)' and 'F2(EXP)' respectively.  The assignment of the final ratings is contingent upon the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already reviewed. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of RAKFUNDING's guaranteed EMTN programme are aligned with National  Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah's (RAKBANK) Long-term and Short-term Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs). This is based on Fitch's expectation that RAKBANK  (BBB+/Stable/F2), which fully owns RAKFUNDING, will support the debt issued  under the programme, if required. RAKBANK has set up RAKFUNDING solely to issue  debt under the programme. The likelihood of support is further evidenced by the  guarantee provided.  Senior notes issued by RAKFUNDING under the programme will be guaranteed by  RAKBANK. RAKBANK's obligations under the guarantee will be an unsecured and  unsubordinated obligation of the bank and will rank at least equally with its  other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  RAKBANK's IDRs are in turn based on high probability of support, if required,  from the UAE federal authorities.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
