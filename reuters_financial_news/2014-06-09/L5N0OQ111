MILAN, June 9 (Reuters) - Bailed-out Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> is launching a 5-billion-euro ($6.9 billion euros) share issue on Monday aimed at repaying state aid and bolstering its balance sheet in light of a pan-European review of banks.

The cash call is one of nine capital increases already completed or due to be launched this year by banks after Italy's longest recession since World War II. [ID:nL6N0ON1VC] Monte dei Paschi, whose share offer comes as Germany's Deutsche Bank is raising 8.5 billion euros, had originally planned to tap investors for 3 billion. [ID:nL1N0OM0B2] But soaring bad loans at the bank prompted it to increase the size of the issue to 5 billion euros, nearly twice its market capitalisation. Monte dei Paschi, the world's oldest bank still in business, is raising cash to partly repay 4.1 billion euros of state aid it was forced to take last year after being hit by the euro zone crisis and a derivatives scandal. The money will also be used to cover for risks stemming from its loan portfolio, which has the highest proportion of non-performing loans among Italy's largest banks.  The Tuscan lender said last week it would offer 214 new shares for every five held, at a price of 1 euro each. That implies a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights share price (TERP), which takes account of the dilutive effect of the new shares, and a 96 percent discount to the previous closing market price. [ID:nL6N0OM5U2] In contrast, Deutsche Bank offered a discount of around 21 percent to the TERP on the first 6.75-billion-euro part of its rights issue. Traders and analysts said the discount at Monte dei Paschi di Siena was meant to protect the issue's underwriters from the risk of a large amount of unsold shares, given the sheer size of the issue. A consortium of underwriters made up of 23 banks is led by UBS <UBSN.VX>. The deal will cost Monte dei Paschi 260 million euros.  Monte dei Paschi said last week the money raised may not be enough to bolster its balance sheet if EU regulators force it to set aside more cash to cover for bad loans.
