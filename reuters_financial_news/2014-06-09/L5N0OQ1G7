DUBAI, June 9 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Etisalat <ETEL.AD> plans a bond issue worth up to 3.1 billion euros ($4.22 billion) split into four tranches, according to a document from lead arrangers provided on Monday.

The United Arab Emirates' largest telecom operator is considering two dollar tranches of the bond, of probably five- and 10-year tenors, plus two euro-denominated tranches of seven and 12 years' duration. This confirms the structure which sources told Reuters last week the operator was planning.
