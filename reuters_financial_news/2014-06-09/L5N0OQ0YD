MOSCOW, June 9 (Reuters) - Russian consumer credit company TCS <TCSq.L> said on Monday first-quarter net profit fell 64 percent, year-on-year, driven by a slowdown in the Russian economy.

TCS, owner of Tinkoff Credit Systems, which went public in London in October, said first-quarter net profit fell to 362.3 million roubles ($10.54 million) from 1 billion roubles a year earlier, missing analysts' forecasts. TCS, founded and majority owned by Russian entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, focuses on Russia's regions, where it delivers credit cards by courier.
