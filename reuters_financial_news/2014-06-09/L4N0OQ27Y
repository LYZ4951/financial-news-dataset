MUMBAI, June 9 (Reuters) - Indian shares surged on Monday to record highs as blue chips such as Coal India <COAL.NS> and Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> continued to rally on hopes of wide-ranging reforms by the new Narendra Modi government.

"What the market is expecting is a key decision making process and early signs show that the (government's) direction is right. Unless something dramatic happens, the market is set for further upmove," said Thunuguntla.
