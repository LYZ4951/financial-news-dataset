PALM BEACH, Fla., June 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve did not react quickly enough to economic developments in its last tightening cycle in 2004-06, a top Fed official said on Monday.

"I think the '04-06 cycle was too methodical and did not react sufficiently to economic developments," Bullard said, explaining that the pace of hikes seemed too set on a calendar schedule. "So, the committee was tightening policy, but the bubble was nevertheless developing under our noses," he told a banking group in Palm Beach, Florida.
