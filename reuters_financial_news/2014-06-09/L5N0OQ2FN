TIRANA, June 9 (Reuters) - Albania's consumer prices fell 1.1 percent month-on-month in May over April, dropping for the second month in a row this year, due to falling food and non-alcoholic drinks prices, the Institute of Statistics said on Monday.

Prices rose 1.6 annually over May last year because of a rise in commodities and various services, it added.   ALBANIAN CPI  MAY 2014   APRIL 2014   MAY 2013  Month-on-month   -1.1-0.6-1.0   Year-on-year1.6 1.7 2.1
