MILAN, June 9 (Reuters) - Shares in bailed-out Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> failed to open but were indicated higher on Monday, as its 5-billion euro share sale started.

The stock was indicated at 1.8480 euros compared to a closing level of 1.54 euros on Friday adjusted for the share sale. The highly dilutive cash call has been priced at a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP), a steep discount implicating a TERP of 1.55 euros.
