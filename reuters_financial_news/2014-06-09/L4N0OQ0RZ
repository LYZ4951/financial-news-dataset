BANGKOK, June 9 (Reuters) - Thai stocks rose on Monday as expectations of a boost to foreign direct investments lifted shares of industrial estate developers, while Indonesian banking stocks fell as investors awaited the central bank's monetary policy meeting later this week.

Thailand's military government appointed a new 18-member executive for the Board of Investment to be headed by the leader of the National Council for Peace and Order and army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha, the Nation newspaper reported. (http://link.reuters.com/vex89v) Analysts expect the new board's chief to expedite the approval process of investment projects. "He is likely to push for approval of investment applications delayed during the political deadlock," strategists of broker KGI Securities wrote in a report. Shares of the biggest industrial estate developer Amata Corp Pcl <AMATA.BK> rose 3.1 percent, while other industrial estate developer Rojana Industrial Park Pcl <ROJNA.BK> jumped 4.5 percent to its highest since Oct. 21. The benchmark SET index <.SETI> was up 0.2 percent at 1,460.29 by midday, climbing at one point to 1,466.15, the highest in more than seven months. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> eased 0.5 percent to a near one-week low, amid active selling in shares of Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK>, Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK> and Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK>. Bank Indonesia is due to meet on June 12. The central bank left its key reference rate at 7.5 percent in the previous meeting on May 8, as widely expected.
