June 9 (Reuters) - Bank Muscat <BMAO.OM>, the sultanate's largest lender, is considering a sale of its brokerage unit as one of several "strategic options" for the business, the bank said in a bourse filing on Monday.

The lender did not give a size or time frame for the potential sale of the unit. In the meantime the division, one of 21 licensed brokerages in Oman, will continue its operations with no impact on customers, the bank said.
