MILAN, June 9 (Reuters) - Bad loans at Italian banks increased to 166.4 billion euros ($227 billion) in April, up nearly 2 billion euros from a month earlier, in a sign of the still-rising toll from a two-year economic recession on bank balance sheets.

Central bank data showed on Monday that bad loans were up 22.3 percent year-on-year in April after a 23.0 percent rise in March.
