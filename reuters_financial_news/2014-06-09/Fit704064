June 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded two junior tranches of  FTPYME TDA CAM 4, FTA and affirmed the rest, as follows:  EUR94.9m Class A2: affirmed at 'BBBsf''; Outlook revised to Stable from Negative EUR76.7m Class A3(CA): affirmed at 'BBB+sf' ; Outlook Stable EUR66m Class B: downgraded to 'CCCsf' from 'Bsf'; RE (Recovery Estimate) 65% EUR38m Class C: downgraded to 'CCsf' from 'CCCsf'; RE 0% EUR29.3m Class D: affirmed at 'Csf'; RE 0%  FTPYME TDA CAM 4, FTA is a granular cash flow securitisation of a static  portfolio of secured and unsecured loans granted to Spanish small- and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by Banco de Sabadell <SABE.MC>.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  The downgrades are a result of increased defaults in the underlying portfolio of  SMEs. Between March 2013 and March 2014, the cumulative level of gross defaults  in the portfolio rose to 7.21% of the initial portfolio balance (EUR1.5bn) from  5.59%.  As a result of the increased defaults, the credit enhancement available to the  class B notes has fallen to 6.85% from 9.95% during the same period.  Additionally, the transaction includes a deferral trigger for class B interest  once cumulative gross defaults rise above 8%. If this trigger is breached, the  interest due on the class B notes will rank junior to principal due on the  senior notes and will remain unpaid until the principal deficiency ledger (PDL)  has been reduced to zero. The PDL balance currently is EUR20.5m. Credit enhancement on the class C notes has fallen to -8.04% from -1.66% in  March 2013. Given the material deterioration in credit protection available to  these notes, default is viewed as probable and the notes were downgraded to  'CCsf'. The rating of the class A2 notes was affirmed as amortisation of the senior  notes offset the defaults in the underlying portfolio, with EUR31.6m repaid in  the last 12 months. As a result the credit enhancement available to the notes  rose to 32.72% from 30.11%. In addition to the growth in credit enhancement, 90  delinquencies in the portfolio (which give an indication of the credit quality  of the performing portfolio) fell to 3.32% from 8.31%. As a result, the Outlook  was revised to Stable from Negative. The rating on the class A3(CA) notes is driven by the Kingdom of Spain  (BBB+/Stable/F2), which guarantees the ultimate payment of principal and  interest on the notes.  The class D notes will be repaid through the proceeds of the reserve fund. As  the reserve fund has been depleted and is unlikely to be replenished, the notes  were affirmed at 'Csf' as default is viewed as inevitable. As the transaction's reserve fund has been depleted to zero and the servicer of  the underlying SME loans is unrated, the transaction has a material exposure to  payment interruption risk. As a result of this, the ratings of the notes have  been capped at 'Asf'.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
