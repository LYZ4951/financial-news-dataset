JERUSALEM, June 9 (Reuters) - Israel's parliamentary finance committee gave approval on Monday for the government to sell its remaining 6.03 percent stake in Leumi <LUMI.TA>, Israel's largest bank, worth about 1.2 billion shekels ($346.78 million).

The sale will happen over the next 12 months in a few stages, with half a percent to be sold to bank employees and the rest to the public, said Accountant General Michal Abadi-Boiangiu. The government bought up nearly all the shares of the country's banks after a crisis in banking shares in 1983. The country's other top banks -- Hapoalim <POLI.TA>, Israel Discount Bank <DSCT.TA> and Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank <MZTF.TA> -- have all been fully privatised. The state last sold some of its shares in Leumi - a 5 percent stake - in 2011. Income from the upcoming sale will help reduce Israel's debt-to-GDP ratio, the parliamentary committee said in a statement. Answering lawmakers questions whether the government, without holding a share, will be able to monitor the bank and influence its operations if needed, Abadi-Boiangiu said: "The state has many ways to deal with the banking system without holding shares in the banks."
