June 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

An increased number of issuers and potential  challenges to asset performance heighten the importance of subtle differences  among CMBS issuers, especially variation in property type concentrations,  property quality grades and geographic locations, Fitch Ratings says.  As of March 1, 2014 we counted 29 active originators. That was more than double  the 14 observed at the end of 2011. At the peak of the market in 2007, there  were 37 active originators. Fitch expects most property sectors to be relatively stable. However, some  sub-sectors may suffer from oversupply. The percentage of hotels contributed to  recent deals has been on the decline. While Fitch has a stable outlook on the  sector, we believe that current revenues could be unsustainable if the supply of  rooms continues to grow. In some cities, such as New York City, 5,414 rooms  recently opened and another 13,230 are under construction (according to STR  Global). Multifamily is also performing well but supply growth is contributing  to increased vacancy in some areas. Other sub-sectors may face contraction. We expect class A offices in urban areas  to improve while class B offices in suburbs will continue to struggle. And we  believe lease renewals in the Washington D.C. area are uncertain as government  programs are cut. Retail rents are slowly improving but financial difficulty at  Sears, JC Penney and other major retailers could lead to a large number of store  closings.  In our view, these challenges to asset performance make the subtle differences  between some issuers more important for bondholders to understand. The majority  of originators we analyzed had a similar mix of property type concentrations. On  average, retail was the highest sector concentration at 32.29%.
