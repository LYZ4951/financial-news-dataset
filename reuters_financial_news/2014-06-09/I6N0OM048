MILAN, June 9 (Reuters) - The chairman of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> said on Monday the Italian lender's rights issue got off to a good start partly due to technical issues.

Shares in Monte Paschi closed up 20 percent on Monday at 1.848 euros after launching a 5 billion euros share sale to help repay state aid and bolster its finances.   "It was a good start. But there are also technical issues," Alessandro Profumo said on the sidelines of an event in Milan, referring to the increase in the share price.
