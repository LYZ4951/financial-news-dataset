June 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded PT Panin  Sekuritas Tbk's <PANS.JK> (Panin Sekuritas) National Long-Term Rating to 'AA-(idn)' from  'A+(idn)'. The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch also has assigned a  National Short-Term Rating of 'F1+(idn) to the company. 'AA(idn)' Long-Term National Ratings denote expectations of very low default  risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default  risk inherently differs only slightly from that of the country's highest rated  issuers or obligations.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating upgrade reflects improvement in Panin Sekuritas's risk profile, which  is underpinned by robust capitalisation and low leverage, resilient performance  in earnings and asset quality as well as manageable exposure in its investment  activities to market risks. In addition, the rating upgrade also considers the  improved regulatory environment, including new rules to set a minimum free float  for publicly listed companies at 7.5% of paid-up capital, which are aimed at  increasing liquidity in the stock market.  Panin Sekuritas' equity to asset ratio has been consistently high and improved  in the last two years due to limited borrowings and strong internal capital  generation. The ratio rose to 74% in 2013from 56% in 2012, thanks to substantial  retention of earnings. The company's business expansion has been largely funded  through its own retained earnings.  Panin Sekuritas's asset management fees continued to increase in the last two  years and were the largest revenue contributor of around 65% of total revenue in  2013. Its assets under management (AUM) of IDR 15tn at end-2013 made it the  sixth-largest asset manager in Indonesia. Panin Sekuritas accounted for about  1.39% of total trading value in the Indonesian brokerage market, placing it 23rd  out of 116 securities companies with Panin Sekuritas's retail accounts  comprising of  about 97% of total brokerage clients.. In Fitch's view, Panin  Sekuritas is one of the strongest domestic securities companies in Indonesia  because of its resilient and strong performance in revenue and profitability  through cycles and contained market risk exposures. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Panin Sekuritas will  maintain a steady risk profile over the near to medium term without significant  increase in  leverage.
