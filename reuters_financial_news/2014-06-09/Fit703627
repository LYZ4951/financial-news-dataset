KEY RATING DRIVERS  Non-diversified Portfolio: The 2014-1 is the sixth transportation-only equipment  transaction. The significantly high concentration of transportation collateral  in the pool reduces equipment and industry diversification. Stronger Collateral: The concentration of small fleet collateral has decreased  to 59.37% from 77.91% in 2013-2. This collateral has historically experienced  higher losses than the large/medium fleet collateral. Increased Obligor Concentrations: Obligor concentration has increased in 2014-1,  with the top 20 obligors representing 18.3%, up from 10.2% in 2013-2. As a  result, the obligor concentration analysis was the primary rating methodology  for the 2014-1 transaction.  Improved Managed Portfolio Performance: GECC's managed transportation portfolio  and securitizations exhibited volatility and asset deterioration from 2007?2009  but has demonstrated marked improvement since 2010.  Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Hard credit enhancement (CE) on the notes is  8.24%, 6.34% and 4.95%, for classes A, B, and C, respectively. Additionally, the  notes benefit from excess spread, expected to be 3.46% per annum. Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: GECC has demonstrated  sufficient abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by  historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the  managed portfolio.  Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should  provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of  payments on the securities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could  produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and  impact available loss coverage and multiples levels. Lower loss coverage could  impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in  coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to  have some sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss  expectation. Under 1.5x base case loss scenario, the notes show limited  sensitivity to this stress and may result in limited downgrades. However, under  the 2.5x base case loss scenario, the notes could potentially be downgraded by  two or more rating categories. Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction  can be found in 'GE Equipment Transportation 2014-1 - Appendix'. This R&W is  compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in Fitch's  April 17, 2012 special report, 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement  Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' .
