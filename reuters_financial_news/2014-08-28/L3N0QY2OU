SINGAPORE, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Straco Corp Ltd <STRA.SI>, which focuses on tourism businesses in China, said it plans to acquire the giant Singapore Flyer ferris wheel in downtown Singapore for S$140 million ($112 million).

The iconic Singapore Flyer was put in receivership last year, just five years after it was launched with the ambition of becoming a main tourist attraction in the city-state. [ID:nL3N0E91ZL] Singapore-listed Straco earned all its revenues from China last year where it operates two aquariums in Shanghai and Xiamen and a cable-car business in the western province of Shaanxi. China Poly Group Corp [CNPGC.UL], a state-owned conglomerate mainly in defence products and real estate businesses, owns a 21.84 percent stake in Straco and is its second-largest shareholder. Straco said it will fund the acquisition through credit facilities and internal resources. [ID:nSNZ4cFbgR]
