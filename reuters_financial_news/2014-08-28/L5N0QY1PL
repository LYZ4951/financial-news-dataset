LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Ukrainian credit default swaps surged to new three-month highs on Thursday and dollar bonds fell as reports of a Russian cross-border military incursion sparked fears of an escalation in the five-month old crisis.

Russian debt insurance costs rose to two-week highs. Russian-backed separatists have taken the strategic high point of Savur-Mohyla in eastern Ukraine, which looks out over wide areas of the region, a Ukrainian military source said. Ukraine 5-year CDS rose 34 basis points from Wednesday's close to trade at 1,016 bps, data from Markit showed while sovereign dollar bonds due 2017 <XS080875819=TE> and 2020 <XS054378319=TE> fell more than one cent on the dollar. Russian five-year CDS, meanwhile, jumped 13 bps to 240 bps, Markit said. Russia's 2020 and 2030 dollar bonds fell between 0.6-0.9 cents <XS011428878=TE> <XS050495434=TE>. JPMorgan analysts moved Russian and Ukrainian dollar bonds to underweight in their model portfolio. "Recent optimism around a negotiated solution to the crisis as reflected in market pricing appears overdone in our view," JPM told clients. "Alleged involvement of Russian regular troops in the conflict potentially increases the probability of another wave of sanctions against Russia in the near term."
