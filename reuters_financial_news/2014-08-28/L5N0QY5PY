PRAGUE, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Real estate developer Orco Property Group <ORCO.PR><ORCO.PA> posted a net loss of 63 million euros for the first half of 2014, the company said on Thursday, after a profit of 7 million a year ago.

The loss does not include the sale of its large Zlota 44 project in Warsaw, announced earlier this week. The closing of the sale will result in a partial reversal of a 47 million euro impairment in the third quarter, it said.
