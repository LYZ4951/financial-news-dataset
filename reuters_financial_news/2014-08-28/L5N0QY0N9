MOSCOW, Aug 28 (Reuters) - State-controlled Russian airline Aeroflot <AFLT.MM> reported on Thursday a 1.9 billion rouble ($52.40 million) net loss for the first half of 2014, compared to a 45 million rouble profit a year ago due to an economic slowdown and one-off items.

Its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation halved year-on-year to 5 billion roubles despite a 9.4 percent increase in revenue. Revenue totalled 140.3 billion roubles, driven by growth in passenger traffic and a decline in the rouble's exchange rate against foreign currencies, the company said in a statement.
