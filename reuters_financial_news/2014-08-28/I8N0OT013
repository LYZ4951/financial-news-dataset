MUMBAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - India's cbank relaxed the manner in which foreign investors can buy government securities by giving them the flexibility to buy these papers in the secondary market without necessarily going through exchange-registered brokers.

In a circular on Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India said the foreign investors can buy government bonds through any "prevalent market practice".
