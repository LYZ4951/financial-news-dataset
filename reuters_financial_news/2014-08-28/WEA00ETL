FRANKFURT, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Buyout group KKR <KKR.N> said it has obtained more than 90 percent of WMF's <WMFG.F> share capital, putting it on track to gain full control of the German cutlery and coffee-machine maker and delist it.

Stakeholders tendered 74.7 percent of preference shares in WMF <WMFG_p.DE> for 58 euros ($76.62) apiece, KKR said on Thursday. Including a stake that co-owner Andreas Weissenbacher has agreed to sell, KKR's holding rises to 90.30 percent of KKR's share capital. KKR said it planned to squeeze out minority shareholders.
