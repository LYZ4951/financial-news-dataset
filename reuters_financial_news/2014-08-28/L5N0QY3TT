LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The owners of two Cypriot bank branches put into special administration after allegations of money laundering want to reach a "reasonable settlement" with Cypriot authorities instead of pursuing a slew of lawsuits, a member of the owning family told Reuters.

FBME's Cypriot branches were taken over by the Central Bank of Cyprus on July 21, four days after the United States issued a report accusing the bank of money laundering. FBME denies the accusations and has hired lawyers and auditors to fight them.  The bank, which is owned by two Lebanese brothers, made an unsuccessful attempt to get an injunction preventing the branches' forced sales and is also pursuing arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce.  On Wednesday, it said it would hold individuals at the central bank legally responsible for damage caused by the resolution measures.   Michael Saab, the son and nephew of the bank's owners and a member of FBME Group's executive committee, said appeals to European courts could "definitely" be considered, but that the legal route was not the bank's preferred one.  "I'm most hopeful of a reasonable settlement with the central bank," he said. "It's very easy going into court, but coming out of court is always a precarious matter and it will cost both of us a lot.   "I'm hopeful that we will continue to be able to do what we've been doing very well for the past 30 years in Cyprus," he added.
