HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <1398.HK> <601398.SS>, the country's largest bank by market capitalisation, reported a 7 percent increase in its first half net profit, in line with forecasts, as net interest margins remained steady.

ICBC said its net profit for the January-June period was 148.1 billion yuan ($24.11 billion). A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a profit of 148.2 billion yuan for the period. The first-half figure implies a net profit of 74.8 billion yuan in the second quarter, up 7.5 percent from the same year-ago period.
