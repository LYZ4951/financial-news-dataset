NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> is expected to file soon for an initial public offering of its U.S. subsidiary, Great Western Bank, according to people familiar with the matter.

NAB, Australia's No. 4 lender by market value, has tapped investment banks Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> and Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> to lead the U.S. public offering of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based bank, the people said. The IPO filing may come as soon as Thursday, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. NAB picked up regional lender Great Western in 2008 for just below $1 billion to get more involved in funding agribusiness in the United States, but the operation lacks the scale of larger competitors in the western states where it operates. Now the flagship of the Australian bank's U.S. banking operations, Great Western has about 200 locations in several states including Arizona and Colorado and has assets in excess of $8 billion, according to its website.
