NICOSIA, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Shareholders of Bank of Cyprus <BOC.CY>, which recapitalised by seizing clients' deposits in 2013, on Thursday approved plans for a 1 billion euro capital issue ahead of EU-wide stress tests later this year.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, partly owned by the European Union, and investors represented by U.S.- based billionaire Wilbur Ross, were among those signing up for the equity issue pricing Bank of Cyprus at 0.24 euro per share.
