DUBAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Burgan Bank <BURG.KW> has chosen banks to arrange meetings with investors ahead of a potential issue of a capital-boosting bond, a document from lead managers said on Thursday.

The lender, the Gulf Arab state's third-largest by assets, will hold roadshows in Asia, the United Arab Emirates and Europe from Sept. 4, with a Tier 1-boosting bond issue to follow, subject to market conditions.
