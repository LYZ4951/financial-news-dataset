BEIJING, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The outstanding amount of China's dollar-denominated Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme stood at $59.7 billion as of the end of August, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said on Thursday.

The outstanding amount under its Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) programme stood at 278.6 billion yuan ($45.36 billion) for the month, said the country's foreign exchange regulator.
