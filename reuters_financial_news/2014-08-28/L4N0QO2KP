SHANGHAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - CITIC Securities Co Ltd <600030.SS><6030.HK>, China's biggest brokerage, posted its fastest earnings growth for any first-half period in eight years due to a surge in fees from IPOs which resumed in January after a year-long freeze.

Net profit for the six months to June jumped 93.2 percent to 4.1 billion yuan ($667.38 million) from 2.11 billion yuan a year earlier, the company said on Thursday. That matched preliminary results released in July. [ID:nL4N0PW1U8] CITIC is enjoying a sharp turnaround from its fortunes last year, when net profit fell 6.2 percent in the first half of 2013 mainly due to a lack of initial public offerings since late 2012.   Haitong Securities Co Ltd <600837.SS><6837.HK> posted a more modest 7.7 percent rise in half-year earnings to 2.9 billion yuan. [ID:nH9N0QP01N]
