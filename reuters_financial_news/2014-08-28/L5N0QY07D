Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government will hold investor meetings next week for its maiden Islamic bond issue, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Thursday.

A meeting will be held in Hong Kong on Monday before one in Singapore on Tuesday, Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday and meetings in Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi and London on Thursday. The AAA-rated government earlier mandated HSBC <HSBA.L>, Standard Chartered <STAN.L>, CIMB Group Holdings <CIMB.KL> and National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> to arrange the issue. The sukuk ijara issue is expected to be listed on the Hong Kong, Malaysia and Dubai bourses, the spokeswoman told Reuters. "The key issuance parameters will be announced later. Currently, we expect the sukuk will be denominated in U.S. dollars and will have a tenor of five years." Hong Kong joins London and Luxembourg in seeking to boost its Islamic finance credentials and attract more business from cash-rich investors in the Gulf and southeast Asia.
