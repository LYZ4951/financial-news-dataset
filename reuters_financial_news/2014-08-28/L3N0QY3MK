HONG KONG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Hony Capital, one of China's biggest private equity firms, has agreed to buy a 15 billion yuan ($246 million) stake in Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Development Co <600754.SS>, the hotel company said on Thursday.

Hony Capital, which manages about $7 billion, will buy 100 million shares in Shanghai Jin Jiang at 15.08 yuan a share, a 23 percent discount to the company's closing price on Thursday of 19.55 yuan, the company said.

The deal has approval from China's commerce ministry, but still needs a green light from China's securities regulator.
