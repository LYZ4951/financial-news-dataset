BANGKOK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Stocks in Indonesia rose for a second day on Thursday as large-caps further recouped recent losses, while Philippine shares snapped a six-session winning streak amid expectations of higher interest rates after strong GDP data.

Jakarta saw a bout of short-covering in recently battered blue-chips, which boosted shares of companies such as Bank Negara Indonesia <BBNI.JK>, one of the country's top-tier lenders. The key index <.JKSE> was up 0.4 percent, adding on a modest 0.36 percent rise on Wednesday.

Shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone <TEL.PS> retreated from Wednesday's record close.

Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> were little-changed, in line with Asian stock markets. Vietnam <.VNI> was up 0.64 percent at the break, with securities firms attracting strong money inflows.
