Aug 28 (Reuters) - British investment firm Melrose Industries Plc <MRON.L> reported a rise of 8.5 percent in half-year pretax profit, bolstered by strong performance in its biggest revenue-generating unit, Elster.

Melrose, which follows a private equity model of 'buy, improve and sell', said weakness in the mining sector was sharply hurting its remaining FKI businesses of Brush and Bridon.
