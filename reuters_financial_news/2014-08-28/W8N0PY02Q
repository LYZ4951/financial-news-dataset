ALPBACH, Austria, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank Governor Marek Belka said on Thursday he was currently more concerned about the potential for the zloty <EURPLN=> to strengthen than to weaken.

"One thing that we are afraid (of) in Poland is that when the situation in Ukraine and Russia stabilises, one way or another, there will be a strong push for the zloty to appreciate," Belka said at the European Forum Alpbach in Austria. "This is more our concern than depreciation," Belka said.
