MUMBAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - India's BSE rose to a record high on Thursday as continued buying by foreign investors lifted blue chips such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp, allowing the benchmark index to post a seventh consecutive monthly gain.

The BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally rose 0.3 percent on Thursday and 3 percent for the month. The gaining streak is the longest since the index rose for eight consecutive months from October 2006 to January 2007.  The NSE index <.NSEI> rose 0.23 percent on Thursday and 3 percent for the month, marking its fourth consecutive monthly gain.
