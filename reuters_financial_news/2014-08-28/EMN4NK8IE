NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Aug 27 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $16.9 billion to $1.040 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $14 billion to $1.057 trillion.
