LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulator said it has fined Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> 4.7 million pounds ($8 million) for incorrectly reporting certain market transactions for nearly six years.

"We have repeatedly highlighted the importance of accurate transaction reporting and taken enforcement action against a number of firms," Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement at the Financial Conduct Authority said in a statement on Thursday. "There is simply no excuse for Deutsche's failure to get this right. Other firms should be in no doubt about our continued focus on this issue," McDermott said.
