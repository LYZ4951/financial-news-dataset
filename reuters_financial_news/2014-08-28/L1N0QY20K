NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> is expected to file soon for an initial public offering of its U.S. subsidiary, Great Western Bank, according to people familiar with the matter.

NAB, Australia's No. 4 lender by market value, has tapped investment banks Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> and Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> to lead the U.S. public offering of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based bank, the people said. The IPO filing may come as soon as Thursday, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. NAB picked up regional lender Great Western in 2008 for just below $1 billion to get more involved in funding agribusiness in the United States, but the operation lacks the scale of larger competitors in the western states where it operates. Now the flagship of the Australian bank's U.S. banking operations, Great Western has about 200 locations in several states including Arizona and Colorado and has assets in excess of $8 billion, according to its website. Representatives for NAB could not be immediately reached for comment, while Bank of America and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Australia's four biggest banks  - NAB, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZ.AX>, Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> and Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> - are investor favorites for their lofty dividends and record profits. But NAB shares have underperformed rivals', partly due to problems at its UK businesses, Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank. While NAB posted a 7 percent rise in third-quarter unaudited cash profit in August, its British business has been weighing on its performance and investors are watching for the bank's potential exit from the U.K. assets. The move to list Great Western is the first major step since Andrew Thorburn took over as NAB's group chief executive on Aug. 1. Analysts have suggested that Thorburn's focus would be to turn around the struggling U.K. banking businesses.
