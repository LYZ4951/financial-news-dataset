HONG KONG, Aug 28 (Reuters) - China shares slipped on Thursday as a batch of initial public offerings started taking subscriptions, diverting money from existing stocks and pulling down the indexes to multi-week lows.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> declined 0.6 percent at 2,195.82 points, the lowest close in three weeks. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was down 0.7 percent to close at a five-week low. Chinese banks extended Wednesday's losses. Agricultural Bank of China <601288.SS>, joining two other major banks, late on Tuesday reported slowing profit growth and rising bad loans for the second quarter. The country's largest lender Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS> shed 1.4 percent, its biggest drop in three weeks. The other three of the "Big Four" banks slid between 1 and 2 percent.
