Aug 28 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories in the Wall Street Journal. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

* The Islamic State runs a self-sustaining economy across territory it controls in Syria and Iraq, pirating oil while exacting tribute from a population of at least eight million, Arab and Western officials said, making it one of the world's richest terror groups and an unprecedented threat.

Morgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and as many as four other banks, in what people familiar with the probe described as a significant breach of corporate computer security. (http://on.wsj.com/1td4fso)  * Argentina's international reserves are starting to dwindle in the wake of the country's second sovereign-debt default in almost 13 years, putting added stress on the peso and an economy believed to be in recession. (http://on.wsj.com/1zHU1Pu)  * Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <IPO-BABA.N> reported big growth in revenue from mobile devices, which may bolster its case next month when the Chinese e-commerce giant begins to pitch investors on its long-awaited initial public offering. (http://on.wsj.com/1qAtKl3)  * A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request from Apple Inc <AAPL.O> to bar Samsung Electronics Co <005930.KS> from selling smartphones and tablets in the United States that infringe on Apple patents.
