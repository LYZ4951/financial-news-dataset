MOSCOW, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's top lender, needs to work more aggressively on costs and non-performing loans but is sticking to its strategic business goals despite Western sanctions, Chief Executive German Gref told a conference call on Thursday.

"We remain optimistic of our ability to reach all our strategic goals and I think we will not turn away from this path," he said.
