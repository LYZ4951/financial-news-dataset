Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Serious Fraud Office has received additional funding from the UK Treasury in its probe of alleged bribery and corruption by defence group Rolls-Royce <RR.L> in China and Indonesia, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.

The Serious Fraud Office and the UK Treasury declined a comment on the story.  The Treasury has agreed to so-called blockbuster funding "in the low millions" of pounds for the SFO's probe, people familiar with the matter told the newspaper on Sunday. The Financial Times said that the secret funding could explain why the SFO made the surprise announcement before Christmas that it was accelerating its interest in Rolls-Royce to an official criminal probe.  Rolls Royce, the world's second-largest maker of aircraft, in December last year confirmed SFO's investigation in the matter.
