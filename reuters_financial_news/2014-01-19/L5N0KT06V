DUBAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, Saudi Arabia's largest listed lender, said in a bourse filing on Sunday its board had recommended a cash dividend of 1 riyal ($0.27) per share for the second half of 2013.

The dividend is half of what Al Rajhi paid out for the final six months of 2012. Al Rajhi reported a 19.1 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profit last Thursday as operating expenses rose - likely due to higher provisioning. [ID:nL5N0KQ2CM]
