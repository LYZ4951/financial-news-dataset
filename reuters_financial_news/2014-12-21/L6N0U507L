CAIRO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Sunday but weakened on the unofficial market.

The bank offered $40 million and said it had sold $37.8 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> to the dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Thursday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.
