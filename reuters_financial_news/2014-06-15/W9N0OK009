WELLINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices fell for the first time in four months in May, but the number of houses sold rose, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Monday.

The REINZ said despite the lift in sales volumes, the market overall was looking soft, driven by falls in the two largest cities, Auckland and Christchurch, which have housing shortages. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) intends to keep the limits on low deposit home loans in place at least until late this year, and is also widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by a further 25 basis points later this week.  The bank has said the housing market is one of the key factors in the timing and extent of rises.
