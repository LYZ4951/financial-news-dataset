DUBAI, June 15 (Reuters) - The stake which Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments [INPTVA.UL] holds in Dubai builder Arabtec <ARTC.DU> has stabilised after falling sharply last week, according to a statement from the Dubai bourse.

Between June 8 and 11, Aabar cut the stake to 18.85 percent from 21.57 percent; its selling fuelled a 30 percent plunge in Arabtec's stock price as investors worried that the commitment of a major shareholder in the firm was waning. Aabar has declined to comment on its strategy. In a brief statement on Sunday, Dubai Financial Market said the stake had now risen slightly to 18.94 percent. It did not elaborate. Aabar is the second largest shareholder in Arabtec after the company's chief executive Hasan Ismaik. In late May, Arabtec said Ismaik had raised his stake to 21.46 percent from 8.03 percent; on Sunday, bourse data showed his stake had risen further to 28.85 percent.
