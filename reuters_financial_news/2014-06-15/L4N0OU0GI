BEIJING, June 16 (Reuters) - Two cuts in reserve requirements for selected banks by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) since April are estimated to have released 150 billion yuan ($24 billion) into the world's second-largest economy, the median forecasts in a Reuters poll of analysts show.

Separately, sources have said the central bank has also conducted two "re-lending" exercises, where it lent a total of 400 billion yuan to commercial banks so that they can re-lend the cash to companies to spur economic growth. Sources told Reuters the first loan was worth 300 billion yuan and the money was given to China Development Bank to refurbish shanty towns, and the second was disbursed to several small- and medium-sized banks to fund farming projects  [ID:nL3N0O82IR] [ID:nL3N0ON13U].
