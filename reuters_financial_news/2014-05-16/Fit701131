May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Dixons Retail PLC's <DXNS.L> Long-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+' with a Stable Outlook and senior unsecured  ratings at 'BB-'.  Fitch has subsequently withdrawn all the ratings, which are unsolicited, due to  the lack of sufficient information to assess the rating impact of the announced  business combination with Carphone Warehouse PLC and the financial profile of  the merged entity.
