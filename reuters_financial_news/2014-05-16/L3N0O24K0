May 16 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service raised its rating on Ireland by two notches to "Baa1" from "Baa3", citing improved outlook for the country's medium-term debt trajectory.

"Moody's expects Ireland's economy to grow considerably faster than the euro area average over the near to medium term," the ratings agency said in a statement.  The agency also cited the significant reduction in the Irish government's contingent liabilities due to a recovery in the property market. (http://r.reuters.com/zek49v)
