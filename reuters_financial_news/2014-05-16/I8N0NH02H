MUMBAI, May 16 (Reuters) - India's BSE index rose as much as 6.1 percent to a record high on Friday as the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies swept the country's elections, although shares gave up a big chunk of the gains towards the close as investors booked profits.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> surged to as high as 25,375.63. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> jumped as much as 6.2 percent to a record high of 7,563.50.  Both indexes surpassed their previous all-time highs hit on Tuesday.
