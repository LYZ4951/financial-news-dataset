May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks held near the unchanged mark shortly after the open on Friday, with more mixed economic data keeping investors from diving in with big bets.

The S&P 500 index <.SPX> once again is testing a support level at the 50-day moving average of 1,867.67, dipping just below to 1,866.99 before rebounding. The index managed to close just above the 50-day in the prior session and a convincing close below that level could indicate more selling pressure.  Telecoms were up more than 1 percent. Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N> is up more than 2 percent after warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> said it bought a new stake of 11 million shares in the company. Verizon shares are among the most active on the New York Stock Exchange so far, with nearly 2.8 million shares traded.

From earlier in the day: 8:53 AM - J.C. Penney <JCP.N> shares are the most active among New York Stock Exchange issues in premarket trade, jumping 19 percent to $9.96 after the troubled retailer's first-quarter earnings topped estimates and comparable-store sales climbed 6.2 percent. [ID:nL3N0O16K4]  World Wrestling Entertainment <WWE.N> holds the No. 2 spot, but heading in the other direction, sliced nearly in half to $10. The company provided an outlook after reaching a TV deal with NBCUniversal that an analyst at Benchmark Co said fell far short of investors' expectations.
