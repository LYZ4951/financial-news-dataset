THE GLOBE AND MAIL * The Conservative government is putting employers on notice that could force them to pay more for temporary foreign workers, a move that would likely make the program too costly for low-wage sectors like restaurants that have been accused of abusing it. (http://r.reuters.com/nyg49v)  * Canada broke with the United States and did not impose sanctions on two key allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin because the pair had Canadian business interests. The revelation puts into question the Canadian government's tough line on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.
