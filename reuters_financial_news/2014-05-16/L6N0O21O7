LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Investors put $400 million into emerging equity funds last week after outflows in the week before, while emerging bond funds drew in $1.2 billion, banks said on Friday, citing data from EPFR Global.

Emerging bond funds pulled in investors for the seventh straight week in the week ending May 14, the Boston-based fund tracker said. It released data to clients late on Thursday. Emerging markets have suffered outflows since the middle of last year on worries about a scaling-back of monetary stimulus in larger markets. But that tide has started to turn. The latest figures bring year-to-date outflows from emerging equity funds tracked by EPFR to $30.5 billion, more than double total 2013 outflows of around $14 billion. Bond funds have shed $7 billion this year, after outflows of $14 billion in 2013.
