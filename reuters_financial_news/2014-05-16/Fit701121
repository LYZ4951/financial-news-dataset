May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Higher Education Securitised Investment No.1 plc  (Thesis), as follows:   GBP29.4m Class A3 notes affirmed at 'CCCsf'; Recovery Estimate (RE) 40% GBP7.9m Class A4 notes affirmed at 'CCCsf'; RE 40%   Thesis is a securitisation of floating-rate student loan receivables, originated  in the UK by the government-owned Student Loan Company Limited, with final legal  maturity in April 2028.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the transaction's stable performance since the last  review. The 'CCCsf' rating reflects the uncertainty regarding the full repayment  of the class A3 and A4 notes, which in Fitch's opinion no longer benefit from  any sizeable margin of safety.  In Fitch's opinion, the transaction is in negative excess spread, meaning that  some principal collections are used to pay for senior fees and interest due on  the accrual facility and the remaining notes. According to Fitch's calculations,  excess spread for the April 2014 collection period would be -0.43% of the  qualifying portfolio per year. In the agency's view, the net redemption of the  accrual facility, which provides liquidity support to the transaction, is due to  the receipt of proceeds from loan cancellations. The non-defaulted loan portfolio now comprises around 87.8% of deferred loans,  6% of loans in repayment status without arrears, and 6.2% of loans in repayment  status with arrears. The large proportion of deferred loans does not in itself  impair the transaction, as the UK government is essentially committed to  compensate the issuer for any loan still outstanding 25 years after origination,  if not in arrears, at principal plus any unpaid accrued interest. The subsidy  paid by the UK government ensures a net asset yield, after subsidy, of one month  LIBOR plus 1.482% per year of the non-defaulted portfolio balance. The impairment of the rated notes may arise from defaults on loans in repayment  status, or on loans currently on deferment and moving to repayment status as a  result of the borrower's improving income. The current impairment of the junior,  non-rated notes in the transaction comes from the cumulative defaults of around  GBP118m to date, the equivalent of 11.6% of the closing portfolio balance. The  class A3 and A4 notes, which rank equally in the priority of payments, currently  benefit from credit enhancement of 8.1%.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
