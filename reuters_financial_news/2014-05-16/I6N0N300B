MILAN, May 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> fell more than 3 percent in early trade on Friday after the mid-sized lender posted a 65 percent fall in first-quarter net profit as revenues dropped.

Carige said late on Friday its total income fell 11.5 percent in January-March due to lower fees and interest income as it cut assets. The bank cut client loans by 4.9 percent year-on-year. "The quarter showed that revenues are still under pressure," broker ICBPI wrote in a note. A planned 800 million euro ($1.1 billion) cash call however should boost the bank's capital ratios to "good levels," it said.
