STOCKHOLM, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S.-based PR software and services firm Meltwater said on Friday it was withdrawing its offer to buy Swedish peer Cision <CISI.ST> after losing a bidding war with private-equity group GTCR.

Meltwater said it had not reached ownership of the conditional 70 percent of Cision shares as GTCR had declared they would not tender their shares. GTCR announced in late April it held almost 72 percent of the shares in Cision. Cision's shares fell 6.5 percent to trade at 60.75 crowns by 1105 GMT, just below the level of GTCR's rival bid. "It is clear that the condition cannot be satisfied. Consequently, Meltwater has today decided to withdraw the offer," Meltwater said in a statement. U.S.-based GTCR's Blue Canyon Holdings raised its bid for Cision to 61 Swedish crowns ($9.29) per share on April 7. Meltwater topped that by raising its bid to 63 crowns per share from 60 crowns. When Blue Canyon made its original offer of 52 crowns per share in February this year, the four biggest owners, with 43.3 percent of Cision shares, said they would support the bid unless a competing bid came in at least 5 percent higher. Redeye analyst Henrik Senestad said this was the main reason Blue Canyon could win control of the company and increase its stake to reach a majority.
