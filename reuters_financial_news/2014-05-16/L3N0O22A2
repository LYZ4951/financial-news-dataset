HANOI, May 16 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rallied 1.04 percent on Friday as foreign investors bargain hunted shares that fell to low prices, analysts said.

"The market is supported by steady and increasing purchase from foreign investors, while pressure from margin call has reduced," said analyst Nguyen Hoang Phuong at Ho Chi Minh City Securities. Foreigners have been net buyers on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange so far this month, with net purchase value totalling 1.4 trillion dong ($66.3 million) as of May 15, the exchange's data showed. Most stocks gained, led by top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> with a 3.94 percent advance. Hanoi-based lender BIDV <BID.HM>, Vietnam's second-biggest bank by assets, also rose 2.11 percent. But the index would not gain strong as investors are sensitive with news on the on-going conflict between Vietnam and China in the South China Sea, which could lead to any immediate selling in case of rising tension, Phuong said.
