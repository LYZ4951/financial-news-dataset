May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Asset-Backed European Securitisation Transaction Nine S.r.l.'s (A-Best 9) notes expected ratings, as follows: EUR437.5m floating rate Class A, due December 2028: 'AA+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR22.5m floating rate Class B, due December 2028: 'A(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR10.0m fixed rate Class C, due December 2028: 'BBB(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR5.0m fixed rate Class D, due December 2028: 'BBB-(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable The expected ratings address timely payment of interest and payment of principal  by the final maturity date in accordance with the transaction documents.  Final ratings are contingent upon the receipt of final documents and legal  opinions conforming to the information already received.  The transaction is a static securitisation of performing fixed-rate auto loans  advanced to Italian individuals by FGA Capital S.p.A. (FGAC, BBB-/Stable/F3), a  joint venture between Fiat S.p.A. <FIA.MI> (BB-/Negative/B), and Credit Agricole S.A. <CAGR.PA>  (A/Stable/F1), through their respective subsidiaries Fiat Group Automobiles  S.p.A. and Credit Agricole Consumer Finance. The senior class A notes will benefit from 13.9% credit enhancement (CE)  provided by the subordination of the class B, class C and class D notes  (together, the mezzanine notes), the unrated class M notes and a 1.4%  non-amortising cash reserve, to be fully funded at closing through a  subordinated loan granted by the originator. The transaction also benefits from  initial excess spread of approximately 3.25% per annum.  The cash reserve will provide liquidity to cover any shortfall of interest on  the rated notes as well as senior expenses. On any payment date, if the cash  reserve plus the available funds are sufficient to fully redeem the rated notes  the cash reserve will be released to do so, thus providing CE.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Strong Portfolio Characteristics Fitch expects lifetime default rates for new- and used-car loans of 1.75% and  3.25%, respectively. The agency applied a common stress multiple of 6.5x at  'AA+sf' on defaults to take into account the late-default definition of 240 days  past due (dpd), the low absolute level of the base case for new-car loans, and  the significant deterioration of the performance of used-car loans throughout  the crisis. The loans were granted to private individuals only, and 91.5% of the provisional  pool as of 8 May 2014, by net present value, was granted for the purchase of a  new car. All loans are fully amortising, hence there is no residual value risk.  Counterparty Risk Related To Linked Contracts The securitised loans also finance the insurance premia of certain policies sold  together with the vehicle. Should the insurance policies be considered linked  contracts, the SPV could be exposed to certain claims by borrowers if both the  insurance company and FGAC default   Sector Outlook and Sovereign Cap Fitch has a stable to declining outlook for Italian consumer ABS transactions.  The rating of the Class A notes is at the cap on Italian structured finance  transactions, which is six notches above the rating of the Republic of Italy  (BBB+/Stable/F2).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected Deterioration in Portfolio Performance Unexpected increases in the default rate and loss severity on defaulted loans  could produce loss levels higher than the Fitch's assumption and could result in  potential rating actions on the notes.
