LISBON, May 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Espirito Santos (BES) <BES.LS> slumped nearly 13 percent on Friday after Portugal's largest listed bank said it was launching a rights issue at a deep discount to the stock price.

BES announced late on Thursday it would carry out the capital increase at 0.65 euro per share - a discount of 34 percent to Wednesday's closing price.  At 0820 GMT, shares in BES were 11 percent lower at 0.945 euro, continuing a slide that started mid-week when local media reported the bank was considering a capital increase. The shares hit a low of 0.916 euro early Friday.  "It (the slide in the shares) is the effect of the capital increase, with the shares moving towards the theoretical price, especially as the discount is so large," said Luis Goncalves, trader at Go Bulling brokers in Porto.  BES also announced a first quarter loss of 89.2 million euros Thursday. [ID:nL6N0O15VT]
