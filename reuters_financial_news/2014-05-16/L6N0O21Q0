MINSK, May 16 (Reuters) - Belarus' central bank will cut its refinancing rate to 21.5 percent from 22.5 percent from May 19, the bank said in a statement on Friday.

This is the second cut in 2014, following a one percentage point cut in April. "The present measure will increase the accessibility of loans while simultaneously preserving a high return for rouble deposits," the bank said.
