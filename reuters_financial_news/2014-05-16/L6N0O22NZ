MOSCOW, May 16 (Reuters) - The Russian government has adopted a forecast of 0.5 percent economic growth for this year, but the finance ministry said on Friday it saw that target as overly optimistic given the risks the country is facing.

A heavy outflow of capital and plummeting investment in the wake of the March annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region has forced the Russian government to pick a sober estimate of the economy's potential. The government had two economic expansion scenarios for 2014-2017, with the more optimistic seeing growth at 1.1 percent this year. On Thursday, it adopted its more conservative target for this year and the next three years.  The finance ministry on Friday confirmed the new scenario but warned that even this forecast, which includes a 2 percent growth goal for next year, looked too ambitious.  "We consider the adopted scenario a bit optimistic. We have told the government that, but we support it," the ministry's press service cited Minister Anton Siluanov as saying.
