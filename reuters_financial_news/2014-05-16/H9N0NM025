HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index produced its best week in more than eight months on Friday, although it finished slightly lower on the day due to consolidation in the financial and property sectors.

The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 0.2 percent, and 2.8 percent higher on the week.

Sunac shares were down 6.5 percent. [ID:nL3N0O20FK] Property stocks erased some weekly gains as investors started to take profit, with China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd <0688.HK> down 1.7 percent.
