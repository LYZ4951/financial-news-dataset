May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Barclays Plc's <BARC.L> (A/Stable/F1/  a) potential upcoming issue of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible  securities (CCS) an expected rating of 'BB+(EXP)'. The securities are expected  to be issued as part of the bank's exchange offer for certain legacy hybrid tier  1 instruments announced yesterday. The final rating assignment is contingent on the receipt of final documentation  conforming to information already received and the exchange offer being  completed.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The CCS are additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments with fully discretionary  interest payments and are subject to conversion into Barclays plc ordinary  shares on breach of a consolidated 7% CRD IV common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio,  which is calculated on a 'fully loaded' basis. The rating of the securities, under Fitch's 'Assessing and Rating Bank  Subordinated and Hybrid Securities' criteria, is five notches below Barclays  plc's 'a' Viability Rating (VR), in line with Fitch's criteria for assigning  ratings to hybrid instruments. The securities are notched twice for loss  severity to reflect the conversion into common shares on a breach of the 7%  fully loaded CET1 ratio trigger, and three times for non-performance risk.  The notching for non-performance risk reflects the instruments' fully  discretionary coupon payment, which Fitch considers as the most easily activated  form of loss absorption. Under the terms of the securities, the issuer will be  subject to restrictions on interest payments if it has insufficient  distributable items, if it is insolvent or if it fails to meet the combined  buffer capital requirements that will be gradually introduced from 2016. At  end-March 2014, Barclays reported a 9.6% fully loaded CET1 ratio and the bank is  targeting a ratio above 11% by 2016. Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit to the securities, which reflects their  full coupon flexibility, their ability to be converted into common equity well  before the bank would become non-viable, their permanent nature and their  subordination to all senior creditors.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  As the securities are notched down from Barclays plc's VR, their rating is  primarily sensitive to any change to the VR, which itself is currently in line  with Barclays Bank plc's VR, as per our 'Rating FI Subsidiaries and Holding  Companies' criteria. Double leverage at the holding company could result in its  VR being rated below Barclays Bank's VR, and hence a downgrade of the  securities.
