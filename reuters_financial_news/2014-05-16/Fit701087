May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed KazAgroFinance's (KAF)  Long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB-' and removed them from Rating  Watch Negative (RWN). A Stable Outlook has been assigned. A full list of rating  actions is provided at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The removal of the RWN on KAF mirrors that on its parent KazAgro National  Managing Holding JSC (KazAgro, BBB/Stable, see 'Fitch Affirms KazAgro at 'BBB';  off RWN; Outlook Stable ' dated 7 May 2014 at www.fitchratings.com), which in  turn reflects the reduced risk that the share of KazAgro's market funding will  consistently overshoot 50% of the total at the expense of state funding, thereby  reducing the government's support propensity for KazAgro and, consequently, KAF. KAF's IDRs, National Long-term and Support Ratings factor in the likelihood of  support the bank may receive, if needed, from Kazakh authorities (through  KazAgro). This is based on  the track record of capital injections, the low cost  of potential support, KAF's status as a material subsidiary of KazAgro and the  significant risks of reputational and market access damage in case of KAF's  default. At the same time, the current two-notch differential between the KAF's foreign  currency IDR and that of the Kazakh sovereign reflects (i) KAF's less prominent  policy role as a development institution and lesser importance for the country's  economy and financial system relative to other government-owned institutions in  Kazakhstan; and (ii) the company's indirect government ownership, which may in  some scenarios impact the timeliness of support. KAF's vulnerable asset quality  and growth plans also mean that its leverage may over time increase  significantly from the current low level.

RATING SENSITIVITIES KAF's ratings are likely be move in tandem with those of the sovereign and  KazAgro.  Fitch may downgrade KAF's ratings if the agency believes that support propensity  in respect to KAF has weakened,  for example, if the company's financial profile  deteriorates considerably as a result of asset quality deterioration or  increased leverage without support being made available.  The rating actions are as follows: Long-term foreign and local currency IDRs: affirmed at 'BBB-', removed from RWN,  Stable Outlook Short-term foreign currency IDR: affirmed at 'F3', removed from RWN National Long-term rating: affirmed at 'AA(kaz)', removed from RWN, Stable  Outlook Support Rating: affirmed at '2', removed from RWN
