May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Interlink Roads Pty Ltd's (Interlink) senior secured bank debt facilities at 'A-'. The Outlook is Stable.  The facilities comprise: AUD432m tranche A due December 2015 AUD288m tranche B due December 2016 AUD13m standby facility due December 2015  Interlink operates the mature M5 Motorway in Sydney, Australia under a  concession agreement with the Roads and Maritime Services agency of the New  South Wales government. In 2012 the concession term was extended by 3.3 years to  2026 as part of an agreement with the government to widen the road.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A-' rating is supported by the M5's continued importance in Sydney's  orbital road network. The motorway provides a key linkage to the Sydney sea port  and airport for the expanding warehousing and distribution infrastructure to the  west of the city. Traffic and revenue have performed strongly since tolling  commenced in August 1992 such that this mature road has reached capacity at peak  times.  For the nine months to 31 March 2014, toll revenue decreased 1.8% yoy, driven by  a 1.7% drop in average daily trips during the period. The traffic decrease was  due to disruption from the current road-widening project, although the decline  was not as much as Fitch estimated at the time of the last review in May 2013.  Usage of the road is expected to increase substantially once the widening  project is complete, as was experienced by the M2 toll road in Sydney following  its expansion in 2013. Therefore, Fitch has assigned a 'stronger' attribute for  volume risk (equivalent to low volume risk). In addition, price risk is deemed  to be 'mid-range' due to provisions in the concession that permit toll increases  that track inflation albeit in 50-cent increments.  The widening project began in July 2012 under a fixed-price and fixed-time  contract with Abigroup Contractors Pty Limited. The project is currently more  than 70% complete and a portion of the new lanes has opened. Overall, the  construction is within budget and on schedule for final completion in December  2014. Fitch notes the strong experience of Abigroup and of its parent company  and guarantor, Land Lease Corporation Limited, as well as the contractual terms  protecting Interlink in the case of cost or time overruns. Fitch's assessment of  completion risk is 'mid-range'.  Interlink puts together an annual major maintenance plan in conjunction with its  50% shareholder, Transurban. Interlink has over 20 years of experience in  operating and maintaining the M5. The road maintenance is straightforward, with  resurfacing required once every 14 years. Completion of the current widening  project should ensure that the M5 is in good condition overall. Interlink  benefits from Transurban's contractor relationships and purchasing economies of  scale. Infrastructure Development and Renewal Risk is assessed as 'stronger'. Once the expansion is completed, the expected traffic ramp-up in combination  with the 3.3 year concession extension should provide ample capacity to repay  debt. Based on Interlink's planned amortisation schedule during 2017-2024,  Fitch's rating case has a projected minimum concession life cover ratio (CLCR)  of 2.04x, including a two-year debt free tail before concession maturity. This  level is consistent with an 'A' category rating.  Interlink is exposed to refinancing risk on bullet maturities, which are short-dated for infrastructure assets. In Fitch's global portfolio, these are  unusual features for 'A' category rated road concessions but typical of  Australian road projects. In addition, Interlink and its main sponsors,  including Transurban Group <TCL.AX> (Transurban Finance Company Pty Limited rated  'A-'/Stable) and major Australian infrastructure investment funds, have a track  record of refinancing maturing facilities with adequate buffer before the due  dates, supported by the sponsors' strong bank relationships. Finally, cashflow  sensitivity analysis shows that Interlink could absorb significantly increased  debt pricing if necessary. Overall, Fitch has assessed Interlink's debt  structure as 'mid-range'.
