LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Oil and gas services company Lamprell <LAM.L> said on Friday it would raise about $120 million from investors for capital investment to improve productivity, reduce operating costs, and strengthen its balance sheet.

The company said the 5-for-16 rights issue would be priced at 88 pence a share, a discount of 39.7 percent to the closing price on 15 May, and it was supported by the group's principal shareholder.
