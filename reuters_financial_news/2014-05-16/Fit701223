May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The New Zealand budget for FY15 plans to capitalise on the strengthening economy to increase the fiscal surplus and reduce net public debt, as Fitch Ratings expected.  The FY15 budget marks the crown government's first fiscal surplus since 2008 as  it projects a core operating balance of plus 0.2% of GDP in FY15, steadily  increasing to plus 1.3% by FY18. The adjustment will be achieved through a  combination of strong revenue growth backed by a robust economy and expenditure  constraints, with a stated target to bring core government spending back below  30% of GDP. While there are no explicit nominal spending cuts, real expenditure  growth is planned at just 0.6% per year over the medium term resulting in a  slight reduction in real spending on a per capita basis.  The budget implies a contractionary fiscal stance, albeit slightly less than in  the previous fiscal projections in December 2013. The Treasury puts the drag at  negative 0.7% of GDP per year on average over the four years to June 2018. The  budget will constrain New Zealand's private-sector-led boom, which is  constructive for the economy's broader stability.  The budget raises the ceiling for operating expenditure (unallocated spending)  to NZD1.5bn per year from NZD1bn. This has driven a modest upward revision in  the authorities' borrowing programme to NZD8bn from NZD7bn. Nonetheless, booming  GDP growth will see New Zealand's public debt profile strengthen sooner than the  authorities previously expected.  New Zealand's net general government public debt increased rapidly to an  estimated 40% of GDP in 2013 from 21% in 2007. The budget plan provides a  sustainable, long-term framework for the reduction of public debt, with the  government targeting net core government debt to peak at 26% of GDP in FY15 and  to fall to 20% by FY20. The government intends to maintain core crown debt  within the range of 10%-20% of GDP, still significantly higher than the trough  of 5.5% in 2008.  The fiscal stance alone cannot credibly plug New Zealand's savings-investment  gap - a longstanding weakness for the sovereign credit. The current account  deficit, need for foreign capital and net external indebtedness are all expected  to persist. Budget economic forecasts see the current account deficit widening  to above 6% of GDP by 2018 owing to a strong exchange rate, falling dairy prices  and increased demand for imports.
