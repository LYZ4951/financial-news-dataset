LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Britain's top equity index edged higher to finish near a 14-year high on Friday, with supermarkets advancing on a defensives-led bounce and bid speculation boosting Wm Morrison <MRW.L>.

Sainsbury <SBRY.L> climbed 4.5 percent, outpacing a 3.8 percent gain by Morrisons and a 2.6 percent rise in Tesco shares <TSCO.L>. The companies were the top three gainers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index <.FTSE>. "Supermarkets are the best performers, with vague chatter surrounding a possible bid for Morrisons," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Morrison's advance was helped by mounting speculation that a U.S.-led private equity consortium was weighing a bid for the company, traders said. The Daily Mail's market report noted talk of a possible 6.4 billion pound ($10.8 billion), or 275 pence a share, cash offer. Morrison declined to comment.  The sector built on gains seen in the previous session when there was a strong bias towards defensive stocks. These often lag when markets rise, supporting a view that the good times will not roll for long. Frothy valuations are stopping investors from aggressively putting money to work in equities. The FTSE 100 is trading on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 13.7 times, against its 10-year average of 11.7 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows."The recent defensive rotation in equity markets underscores our view that the wider risk-on rally now looks tired," said Graham Bishop, senior equity strategist at Exane BNP Paribas. The FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent to 6,855.81 points to finish near this week's 14-year high. It fell 0.6 percent in the previous session, taking its cue from Wall Street, which sold off after results from Wal-Mart <WMT.N> disappointed and as small-cap shares extended their retreat. The UK small cap index <.FTSC> was down 0.8 percent, while the mid-cap index <.FTMC> fell 1.4 percent, underperforming the wider stock market. The FTSE 100's gains were capped by losses at bottler Coca-Cola HBC <CCH.L> after disappointing results, and as UK homebuilders fell on concerns that authorities may intervene to prevent a housing market bubble. Coca-Cola HBC, the world's No. 2 bottler of Coca-Cola <KO.N> drinks, fell 4.6 percent, the worst performing stock on the FTSE 100 after a bigger-than-expected currency-related quarterly loss  in its Russian and Ukrainian operations. [ID:nL6N0O21KR] Home builders fell on growing expectations that the Bank of England may try to stop a housing bubble by tightening standards for mortgage lending. Speculation is rife that the central bank's Financial Policy Committee will toughen lending rules when it meets on June 17. Barratt Developments <BDEV.L>, the country's biggest housebuilder by volume, fell 3.8 percent, while Persimmon <PSN.L> was down 1 percent. "Investors are watching house prices, which have risen quickly. The Bank of England is clearly monitoring the situation and could take some action to stop the situation turning into a bubble," said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Britain's housing market has made a swift recovery from the global financial crisis, with prices up about 10 percent in the past 12 months. [ID:nL6N0NZ4XY]
