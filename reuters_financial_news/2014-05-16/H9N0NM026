HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - China shares ended slightly higher on Friday with weakness in the technology sector capping gains, but secured their first weekly rise after four weeks of losses.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.1 percent at 2,026.50 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also closed up 0.1 percent. On the week, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.8 percent. The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mostly high-tech start-ups listed in Shenzhen slumped 1.7 percent as investors are concerned about valuation on the Chinext board.  Wangsu Science & Technology Co <300017.SZ> dived 9.0 percent and Hangzhou Shunwang Technology Co <300113.SZ> stumbled 6.1 percent. The property sector recovered some losses from Thursday ahead of the data on April house prices due on Sunday.
