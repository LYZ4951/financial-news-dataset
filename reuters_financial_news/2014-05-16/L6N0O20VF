ZURICH, May 16 (Reuters) - Swiss property redeveloper HIAG Immobilien <HIAG.S> priced its initial public offering at 76 Swiss francs per share, in the lower half of a prospective range, giving the firm an implied market value of around 608 million francs ($683 million).

HIAG, which redevelops former industrial and commercial sites to create new residential and office properties, sold 1 million newly issued shares as well as 700,000 existing treasury shares in the IPO. Three anchor shareholders also sold 847,500 existing shares, bringing HIAG's free float to 31.8 percent. There is also an overallotment of up to 255,000 shares, which can be exercised within 30 calendar days after the first day's trading. Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> is the sole bookrunner and Bank Vontobel <VONN.S> is acting as co-lead manager.
