May 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed Turkey's Tekstil Bankasi A.S. <TEKST.IS> (Tekstilbank)'s Long- and Short-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), National Long-term and Support Ratings on Rating Watch Positive  (RWP).  A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating  action commentary. The RWP follows Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's <601398.SS> (ICBC; A/Stable)  purchase of 75.5% of Tekstilbank's equity from the bank's current owner GSD  Holding. The acquisition is pending regulatory and GSD Holding shareholders'  approval.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, National and Support Ratings Fitch views ICBC's ability to support Tekstilbank, if ever needed, as very high  given its rating level and Tekstilbank's small balance sheet relative to ICBC's,  which should limit the potential cost of support for ICBC. Fitch will assess  ICBC's propensity to support Tekstilbank as more information on the acquisition  is available.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT The RWP will be resolved upon completion of the transaction. If the acquisition  is successful, the bank will likely see a multi-notch upgrade of its Long-term  IDRs, National and Support Ratings. The bank's Long-term foreign currency IDR  will most likely be upgraded to 'BBB', Turkey's Country Ceiling.   The rating actions are as follows:   Tekstil Bankasi Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs: 'B+'; Rating Watch Positive  Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs: 'B'; Rating Watch Positive Viability Rating: 'b+'; unaffected Support Rating: '5'; Rating Watch Positive Support Rating Floor: 'No Floor'; unaffected
