LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Major European equity indexes opened flat to lower on Friday as a gloomier economic picture in Europe and a selloff on Wall Street dented risk appetite, though the caution was balanced by hopes for renewed deal-making activity.

French industrial and telecoms conglomerate Bouygues <BUOY.PA> was a sharp outperformer, rising 3.7 percent on speculation about a possible tie-up with Orange <ORAN.PA>, whose shares rose 1.2 percent. At 0708 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was down 0.1 percent at 1,356.89 points, while France's CAC <.FCHI> was up 0.1 percent after recording its steepest daily fall since late March on Thursday on the back of disappointing GDP data.
