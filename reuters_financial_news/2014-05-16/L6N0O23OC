ATHENS, May 16 (Reuters) - Greece plans to scrap the tax liability on capital gains for foreign holders of Greek bonds booked over 2012-13, to soothe investor fears that Athens was planning to collect the tax retroactively, two finance ministry sources told Reuters.

The government was forced to deny on Thursday that it instituted a retroactive tax on foreign holders of Greek bonds after a government tax circular helped push Greek 10 year-bonds to near two-month highs. It later revoked the document, but that failed to erase uncertainty over the liability.

A second official said the government was still deciding on the method by which it will scrap the liability, possibly through a new law.
