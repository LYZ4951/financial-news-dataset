MUMBAI, May 16 (Reuters) - India's BSE index rose as much as 6.1 percent to a record high on Friday as the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies swept the country's elections, although shares gave up a big chunk of the gains towards the close as investors booked profits.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> surged to as high as 25,375.63, before ending the day at 24,121.74, up 0.9 percent. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> jumped as much as 6.2 percent to a record high of 7,563.50, before closing 1.12 percent higher at 7,203.  The BSE index rose 4.9 percent for the week, while the NSE index marked a weekly gain of 5 percent, their biggest weekly gains since the week ended December 2, 2011. Domestic-focused shares led the gainers: ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> soared 5 percent while Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS> gained 3.6 percent, reflecting hopes that the BJP is best placed to revive an economy growing at its slowest in a decade. However, exporters fell as the rupee rose to a eleven-month high. Wipro <WIPR.NS> fell 2.7 percent while Dr. Reddy's Laboratories <REDY.NS> slumped 3 percent.
