MUMBAI, May 16 (Reuters) - The Indian central bank was likely buying dollars via state-run banks starting around 58.70 rupee levels after the rupee earlier hit its strongest against the dollar in 11 months, three traders said.

The rupee was <INR=D2> trading at 58.87/88 per dollar by 0615 GMT, off its session high of 58.62, its highest since June 19. The currency closed at 59.29/30 on Thursday. The rupee gained after early counting showed the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies leading in 335 seats, way above the 272 seats required to win a majority in the lower house.
