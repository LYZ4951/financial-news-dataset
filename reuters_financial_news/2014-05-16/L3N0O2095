HONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's NWS Holdings Ltd <0659.HK> plans to sell its interest in a Macau power supplier to a China state-owned company in a deal worth $612 million, as the transport-to-energy   operator focuses on water and related businesses.

NWS said its equally owned joint venture with Suez Environnement Company <SEVI.PA> had agreed to sell its 90 percent stake in Sino-French Energy Development Co Ltd to Nam Kwong Development, a company under China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Macau gambling kingpin Stanley Ho holds the remaining 10 percent of Sino-French Energy, which in turn owns 42.2 percent of Macau electricity supplier Companhia de Electricidade de Macau-CEM, S.A. As part of the deal, the NWS joint venture will have an option to buy back 9 percent of the stake in Sino-French Energy, NWS said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Thursday.
