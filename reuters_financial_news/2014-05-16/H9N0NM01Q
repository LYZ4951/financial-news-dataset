MACAU, May 16 (Reuters) - Macau authorities have urged banks to restrict the use of China's state-backed bank card at some luxury stores in casinos in the world's largest gambling hub, according to a banking source with knowledge of the situation.

The crackdown follows a Reuters investigative report in March that highlighted the illegal use of UnionPay cards to obtain cash through fake purchases of goods in Macau, to evade China's strict currency-export controls. [ID:nL3N0KY2T7]
