BOSTON, May 16 (Reuters) - Legg Mason Inc <LM.N> will lay off 62 professionals from its Boston-based Batterymarch Financial Management unit as it is combined with QS Investors, a spokeswoman said on Friday, following a deal announced in March.

The Baltimore-based asset manager had said an unspecified number of jobs would be cut after its purchase of privately-held QS of New York, into which Batterymarch and Legg Mason Global Asset Allocation are being merged to form a new quantitative investing unit. [ID:nL3N0M142B]
