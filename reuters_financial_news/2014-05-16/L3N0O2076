SYDNEY, May 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares slipped on Friday, tracking a pullback in Wall Street stocks, with investors eyeing potential offshore risks including a slowing Chinese economy and the Ukraine crisis in the absence of major local catalysts.

Banks weighed on the market, with top lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> losing 0.8 percent after touching a record high the previous day. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> shed 0.7 percent and Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> fell 0.6 percent as both stocks traded ex-dividend. "Given the fact most of them have already traded ex-dividend - interest might be limited in the near term, until they return to more appealing levels," said Stan Shamu, market strategist at IG. The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> was down 0.5 percent or 26 points at 5,484.2 as of 0144 GMT, after rising 0.3 percent to a two-week high on Thursday. It is up 0.4 percent on the week. The benchmark struck a near six-year high of 5,554.5 points on April 29, but has drifted sideways in a narrow range this week as economic events and a handful of corporate results offered no major surprises. Investors in equities have a long list to worry about including the market being overvalued, the end to U.S. monetary stimulus and a slowdown in China, Tim Radford, global investment manager at Rivkin Securities, said in a note to clients. "At the moment, there isn't much to be positive about," Radford said. "The biggest near-term concern is the fact U.S. equity markets haven't had a large scale correction in over two years, with stocks losing momentum fast." Among notable movers, SGF Australia <SFW.AX> rocketed 21.2 percent to A$0.885, its highest point since May 2002, after agreeing to a takeover by larger financial services rival IOOF Holdings Ltd <IFL.AX> for about A$670 million. IOOF rose 2.1 percent. [ID:nL3N0O20BE] Toll road operator Transurban <TCL.AX> jumped 1.4 percent to a five-week high of A$7.36 after credit ratings agency Moody's affirmed its BAA1 rating and revised the outlook to stable from developing, after the company successfully completed a capital raising to fund its acquisition of Queensland Motorways. [ID:nMDY6Nt4XN]  Elsewhere, Leighton Holdings Ltd <LEI.AX> said it is still in advanced negotiations regarding the settlement of a shareholder class action, and a settlement has not yet been signed. Leighton shares were down 1.3 percent.[ID:nWNAS002U0] Goodman Fielder Ltd <GFF.AX> said it will consider a fresh A$1.37 billion takeover offer from Wilmar International <WLIL.SI> and First Pacific Co <0142.HK>. Shares in the Australian food company slipped 0.3 percent.
