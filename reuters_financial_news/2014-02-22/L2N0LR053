MEXICO CITY, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Mexico's new telecommunications regulator said on Friday that the country's broadcasters must offer public channels to their pay TV competitors at no charge.

The decision by the Federal Institute for Telecommunications (IFT) would require dominant market players Televisa and TV Azteca to allow competitors like Dish Mexico to transmit their so-called free-to-air channels on its own satellite system. New rules known as 'must offer, must carry' oblige pay television services to offer the public channels. But the broadcasters have said that since the government has not yet agreed on the details behind these rules, they should not yet be forced to hand over their content for free. Televisa had sought a court ruling to prevent the IFT from deciding the matter, but that effort was overturned last week when Mexico's Supreme Court said the regulator has the power to make the decision. Established by constitutional telecommunications reform last year, the IFT was designed to increase competition in Mexico's television and phone markets. The dispute is one part of a larger telecommunications clash that pits Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim and his dominant phone and internet company America Movil <AMXL.MX> against Televisa <TLVACPO.MX> and TV Azteca <AZTECACPO.MX>.
