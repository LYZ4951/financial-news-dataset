Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. television start-up Roku is aiming to launch an initial public offering this year, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The company, which makes set-top boxes that connect TVs to the Internet, recently spoke to banks about the possibility of going public but is yet to hire a lead bank for the process, the report said. (http://r.reuters.com/mex96v) Roku competes with Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> Apple TV and is working with U.S. cable operators such as Time Warner Cable Inc <TWC.N> to let users stream their cable TV through the box. The company raised $60 million last May in a funding round that included Hearst Corp, News Corp <NWSA.O> and British Sky Broadcasting <BSY.L> as well as institutional investor Fidelity. [ID:nL2N0EA1CY] Roku spokeswoman Tricia Mifsud said Roku, as a matter of policy, does not comment publicly about its future financing plans.
