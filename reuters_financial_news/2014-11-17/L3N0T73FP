HANOI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.09 percent on Monday as equities moved mixed in low volume amid high margin trading ratio while investors waited for regulations on the limit of stock loans.

The number of rising shares was almost equal to those that lost ground, while volume dropped to 114.41 million stocks, the lowest since Nov. 6, Reuters data showed. "Large funds are awaiting news relating to a central bank draft that would either enlarge or cut margin trading limit," said analyst Do Quang Hop at Saigon-Hanoi Securities. Hanoi-based lender BIDV <BID.HM> led the gainers to rise 1.54 percent, while Vietcombank <VCB.HM> was among the top decliners with a 0.73-percent fall.
