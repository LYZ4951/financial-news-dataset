LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - British hedge fund ISAM, founded by ex-Man Group <EMG.L> chief executive Stanley Fink, said on Monday it had launched a new currency brokerage service for institutional clients, named IS Prime.

The new unit would provide retail brokers, asset managers, banks, hedge funds and family offices with a range of services including risk management, access to prime brokerage services -  for example lending money - as well as trading liquidity. The business would be led by Jonathan Brewer and Raj Sitlani, who join from Sucden Financial, ISAM said in a statement. "The launch of IS Prime, allows us to capitalise on the partnership template between a hedge fund and brokerage business, that I realised during my tenure at Man Group," CEO Fink said.
