HONG KONG, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Chinese buyers took up only 17 percent of their 10.5 billion yuan daily quota of Hong Kong stocks on Monday, as mainland investors gave a lukewarm response to the launch of a landmark scheme connecting the Hong Kong and the Shanghai stock markets.

That was in sharp contrast to the volume of trade in the opposite direction, where a daily investment quota of 13 billion yuan for Shanghai stocks was quickly exhausted as international investors made a beeline for mainland markets. [ID:nL3N0T7090]
