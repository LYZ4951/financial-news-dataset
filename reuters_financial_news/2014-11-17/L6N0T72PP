LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Turkey's largest food group Yildiz Holding's acquisition of UK-based snacks maker United Biscuits will be backed with a 985 million pound (1.54 billion US dollar) leveraged loan financing, banking sources said on Monday.

Yildiz, a food and beverage maker which owns Ulker Biskuvi <ULKER.IS>, agreed to buy United Biscuits from private equity owners Blackstone Group and PAI Partners on November 3 after an auction process, paying around 2 billion pounds backed with a loan financing underwritten by HSBC <HSBA.L>. [ID:nL6N0SU348] The all-senior loan financing, which is 4.9 times leveraged, will tap both bank and institutional investor liquidity and will be showcased at a bank meeting on November 21 in London, the banking sources said. The loan financing consists of a 760 million pound term loan B, denominated in euros and sterling; a 150 million pound term loan A; and a 75 million pound revolving credit facility, the banking sources said.
