CAIRO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was unchanged at a central bank dollar sale on Monday but weakened on the black market.

The bank said it had sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from the previous sale on Thursday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. The bank offered $40 million on Monday. In the unofficial market, the pound was trading at 7.67 to the dollar at midday Thursday, one trader said, weaker than Thursday's rate of 7.57.
