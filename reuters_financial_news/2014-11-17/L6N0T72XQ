EDINBURGH, Nov 17 (Reuters) - European stocks pared losses on Monday and turned slightly positive as resilience in peripheral banks boosted the euro zone's main index.

The EuroSTOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> turned positive, up 0.2 percent, led up as Italian banks Unicredit <CRDI.MI> and Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> extended gains. Nomura earlier reiterated a "buy" rating on Unicredit, and lifted its target price on Intesa. Meanwhile, Spain's Banco Santander was said to be studying the possible acquisition of Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> for around 700 million euros, El Confidencial reported, citing sources with knowledge of the process.

They've been out of favour, and now stress tests are out the way, they can keep climbing," Zeg Choudhry, managing director at LONTRAD, said.
