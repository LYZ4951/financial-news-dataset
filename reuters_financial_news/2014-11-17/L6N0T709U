DUBAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Dubai and Saudi Arabia may slide further on Monday after both closed near their daily lows on Sunday, and as the global background appears unsupportive. A diplomatic reconciliation with its neighbours could lift the mood in Qatar.

Dubai's index <.DFMGI> fell 1.2 percent and closed on its intra-day low of 4,603 points on Sunday as Arabtec <ARTC.DU> tumbled 5.9 percent after its third-quarter profit missed analysts' estimates.  Saudi Arabia's index <.TASI> lost 1.3 percent and closed at 9,554 points, not far from the intra-day low of 9,525 points, after shares in Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma'aden) <1211.SE>, whose price was reduced by 7.5 percent to reflect dilution from a rights issue, fell a further 2.9 percent. On global markets, Japanese stocks are dropping on Monday on news the country has slipped into recession, and other Asian equities are edging down. Brent crude oil fell to $79 a barrel following the news from Japan. [MKTS/GLOB] [O/R] In a positive development for Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain agreed on Sunday night to return their ambassadors to Doha, signalling an end to an eight-month rift over its support for Islamist groups. [ID:nL6N0T6176] In March, when Qatar's neighbours withdrew their ambassadors, the Doha benchmark <.QSI> briefly dropped 3.0 percent on the news.
