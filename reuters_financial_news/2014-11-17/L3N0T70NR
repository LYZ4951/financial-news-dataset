SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Australian shares declined on Monday, as falls in healthcare and telecommunications stocks were further compounded by weakness in Japanese stocks after data showed the world's third-biggest economy unexpectedly slipped into recession.

CSL Ltd <CSL.AX>, Cochlear Ltd <COH.AX> and Sonic Healthcare Ltd <SHL.AX> dropped around 1.5 percent each after investors booked profits following recent hefty gains. The healthcare index <.AXHJ> set a record high earlier this month to be up 12 percent so far this year. The mood in the market was somewhat subdued after Japan reported a surprise 1.6 percent contraction in third quarter gross domestic product, throwing the world's third-biggest economy into recession. [ID:nL3N0T612F] Japan is Australia's second largest export market after China. The Japan GDP data raises concerns about the "mounting national debt, given further stimulus seen from a couple of weeks back and continued speculation of an early snap election," said Tristan K'Nell, head of equities at Quay Equities. The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> eased 20.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,433.5 by 0125 GMT, having shed 1.7 percent last week. However, a bounce in metal prices and a stabilisation in iron ore, Australia's largest export earner, underpinned the resource sector and helped offset losses. Fortescue Metals Group <FMG.AX> rallied 3.6 percent to A$3.15, pulling away from a 17-month trough of $2.9 touched last week.  BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> also rose. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was a touch softer at 5,480.925, having set a record high of 5,507.47 last week.  The strongest gain was for pharmacy retailer Green Cross <GXH.NZ> up 7.7 percent after it said it would buy a home healthcare company.  [ID:nWNAS007RQ]
