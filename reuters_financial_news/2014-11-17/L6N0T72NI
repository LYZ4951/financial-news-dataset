MOSCOW, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Russian central bank said on Monday that the low demand at its first one-year dollar repo auction showed that there was no deficit of foreign currency among the country's banks.

The bank said it had placed $87.7 million of 1-year dollar repos at an average rate of 2.1388 percent. The maximum volume had been set at $10 billion. [ID:nL6N0T72LO]
