BUDAPEST, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Hungary's relief scheme for mortgage borrowers and new loan regulations could cost its banks 120 billion forints ($490.18 million) each year, the local unit of Belgian lender KBC <KBC.BR> said.

The country's banking sector has faced a raft of punitive taxes and charges since the financial crisis. Prime Minister Viktor Orban wants to eliminate the originally low-interest foreign currency loans, most of them denominated in Swiss francs, which many Hungarian families took out prior to 2008, when exchange rates were more favourable. [ID:nL6N0SU4SM] Hungary passed a law in September forcing banks to refund household borrowers up to 1 trillion forints. Shrinking loan books and lower interest rates will also eat into banks' earnings. [ID:nL6N0RU2BZ] "Our interest income would decrease by a little bit more than 10 percent," said Hendrik Scheerlinck, chief executive of KBC's Hungarian unit, K&H. K&H reported a net profit of 7.9 billion forints in the third quarter. But for the first nine months, it was still in the red, largely due to provisions for the settlement of household mortgages.
