HONG KONG, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares, swinging between gains and losses, finished down on Monday, the first day of trading for the landmark Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect scheme.

The Hang Seng index <.HSI> unofficially closed down 1.2 percent to 23,797.1 points while the Hong Kong China Enterprises index <.HSCE> fell 1.9 percent. Profit-taking pulled down the Hang Seng, following its nearly 8 percent rise since early October. The trading link lets international investors trade Shanghai-listed shares directly for the first time via the Hong Kong stock exchange, and mainland China investors to trade in Hong Kong shares via the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
