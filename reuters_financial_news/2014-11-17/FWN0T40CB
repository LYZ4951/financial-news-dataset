PARIS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - France will make a decision on the sale of a minority stake in Toulouse-Blagnac airport in southwestern France "in about a month", Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said on the sidelines of a conference on Monday.

Three groups remained in the running for the stake as of Nov. 4: construction and concession company Vinci <SGEF.PA>, together with CDC Infrastructure and EDF Invest <EDF.PA>; Paris airports operator ADP <ADP.PA> along with insurer Predica; and Canadian engineering giant SNC-Lavalin <SNC.TO> in partnership with two Chinese investors.
