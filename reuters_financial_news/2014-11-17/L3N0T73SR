MUMBAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose to record highs on Monday as state-run lenders rallied after State Bank of India <SBI.NS> reported better-than-expected asset quality in July-September, raising hopes for a revival in a sector laden by bad loans.

Sentiment also got a boost after trade deficit <INTRD=ECI> in Asia's third largest economy narrowed to $13.35 billion in October from $14.25 billion in September, according to government data. [ID:nD8N0RJ01L] Continued foreign buying also helped sentiment. Overseas investors bought shares worth 6.96 billion rupees ($112.8 million) on Friday, bringing their total purchase in stocks to $15.24 billion so far in 2014.  "Reducing non-performing loans, along with falling inflation, is leading to a belief of higher profits at state-run lenders which will continue for sometime," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm. The BSE index <.BSESN> rose as much as 0.57 percent to an all-time high of 28,205.71. The index ended up 0.47 percent.  The NSE index <.NSEI> closed 0.49 percent up after earlier hitting a record high of 8,438.1. State Bank of India led the rally in state-run lenders, ending 5.5 percent higher after earlier hitting its highest intraday level since April 2011.  India's biggest lender reported late on Friday better-than-expected asset quality despite posting a 52 percent increase in provisions for bad loans in its second quarter. [ID:nL3N0T725K]  SBI's results attracted investors to state-run lenders, which have lower ownership and valuations relative to private sector rivals, traders added. Bank of Baroda <BOB.NS> rose 4.2 percent, while Punjab National Bank <PNBK.NS> ended up 2.7 percent.   In government-run power sector lenders, Rural Electrification Corp <RURL.NS> jumped 10.2 percent, while Power Finance Corp <PWFC.NS> soared 7.6 percent. Among mid-cap banks, Central Bank of India <CBI.NS> rose 4.3 percent, while Federal Bank <FED.NS> advanced 3.2 percent. Rally in state-run lenders pushed the NSE bank index <.NSEBANK> to an all-time high of 17,676.60 before closing 0.36 percent higher. Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> shares also gained 4.1 percent after earlier rising to its record high of 547.55 rupees on its unit Jaguar Land Rover's <TAMOJL.UL> earnings, though the Indian auto maker reported a 7 percent fall in net profit in the July-September quarter. [ID:nL3N0T453G] Balkrishna Industries <BLKI.NS> slumped 7.1 percent, adding to Friday's 16.6 percent decline after price cuts weighed on July-September earnings, analysts said.
