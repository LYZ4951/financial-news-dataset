PARIS, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Sanofi <SASY.PA> bought back shares for the first time in four months, following a sharp fall in the French drugmaker's shares prompted by concerns over its diabetes business and the dismissal of its CEO.

Sanofi repurchased 905,000 shares at an average price of 74.33 euros each between Nov. 7 and Nov. 13, the French company said in a statement on its website. The buyback, worth 67.27 million euros ($84 million), was the first since early July, when Sanofi repurchased 1.18 million shares at an average price of 77.14 euros each.   Sanofi shares were 0.75 percent higher at 75 euros at 1414 GMT. They are down 3.5 percent so far this year and fell over 11 percent in the past two weeks after the company warned that its key diabetes business would likely not grow next year. The following day, Sanofi's board sacked its chief executive of six years, Chris Viehbacher, blaming his solitary management style and poor execution of the group's strategy. [ID:nL5N0SO0JM]
