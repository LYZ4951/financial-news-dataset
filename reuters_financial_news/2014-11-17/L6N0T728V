STOCKHOLM, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Swedish state-owned mortgage lender SBAB on Monday slashed the borrowing cost for its 5-year mortgage to a record low, putting pressure on the country's commercial banks to follow suit.

SBAB said in a statement it wants to encourage households to reduce risk by opting for longer-term mortgages.  Household debt levels in Sweden are among the highest in Europe and rising, a threat to the stability of the economy, while at the same time mortgage lending is among Swedish banks' most profitable businesses.  SBAB lowered the interest rate for its 5-year mortgage by 65 percentage points to 2.10 percent, which is lower than its 3-month mortgage, and between 64 and 71 points lower than biggest banks Nordea's <NDA.ST>, Swedbank's <SWEDa.ST>, SEB's <SEBa.ST> and Handelsbanken's <SHBa.ST> 5-term mortgages.
