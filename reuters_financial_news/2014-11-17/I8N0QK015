MUMBAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose to record highs on Monday as state-run lenders rallied after State Bank of India <SBI.NS> reported better-than-expected asset quality in July-September, raising hopes for a revival in a sector laden by bad loans.

State Bank of India provisionally ended 5.5 percent higher after earlier marking its highest intraday level since April 2011, while Bank of Baroda <BOB.NS> rose 4.4 percent.
