LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - London's benchmark FX "fixings" will move to a five-minute calculation window from one-minute currently as of 2200 GMT on Sunday, Dec. 14, the WM Company said in a memo sent to banks on Monday.

The widening of the window was recommended by global regulators the Financial Stability Board in the results of a consultation with the industry published in September.  The London or "WM/Reuters" fix relates to several exchange rates and is compiled using data on actual transactions from trading systems like those run by Thomson Reuters <TRI.TO> and  ICAP-owned EBS <IAP.L>. The rates for the fixings, at the centre of a global investigation into alleged market manipulation that saw five major banks fined last week, are calculated by WM, a unit of State Street Corp <STT.N>. Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News, which is not involved in the process.
