SHANGHAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - China stocks ended slightly lower as profit-taking pressures offset the first buying by foreign investors through a landmark Hong Kong-Shanghai trading link that debuted on Monday.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.2 percent to 2,475.1 points, while the CSI300 index <.CSI300> of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 0.5 percent.   All of the daily 13 billion yuan ($2.12 billion) "northbound" quota - limiting how much Hong Kong-based investors can buy in Shanghai - had been used by mid-afternoon trading. Only around 16 percent of the 10.5 billion yuan "southbound" quota was taken up.  The so-called Stock Connect scheme gives foreign and Chinese retail investors unprecedented access to each of the two exchanges, which some analysts said could eventually lead to the creation of the world's third largest stock bourse.
