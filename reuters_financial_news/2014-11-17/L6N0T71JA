WARSAW/MADRID, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Santander <SAN.MC>, the euro zone's biggest bank, is planning to list its shares in Warsaw by year end as agreed with the Polish financial regulator KNF, Santander said on Monday.

The KNF wants parent companies of Polish entities to be listed in Warsaw, to help promote the market as well as give it access to parent company data to help its regulatory functions, analysts say. The Spanish lender had committed to a dual listing this year in Warsaw, the biggest bourse in central and eastern Europe, when it received permission in 2012 to merge its BZ WBK <BZW.WA> with the then Belgian KBC-owned <KBC.BR> Kredyt Bank to create Poland's No.3 lender.
