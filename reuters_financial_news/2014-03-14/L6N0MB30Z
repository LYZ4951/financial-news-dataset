LAGOS, March 14 (Reuters) - Nigerian interbank lending rates rose sharply to 19 percent on Friday, up from 10.66 percent last week, supported by large cash outflows to fund deposit insurance premiums and on bonds purchases.

Nigeria's Deposit Insurance Corporation charged lenders about 100 billion naira ($607 mln) for insurance premiums against bank deposits, while another 85 billion naira went to fund bond purchases. On Friday, the cash balance that lenders hold at the central bank opened at 158 billion naira in credit, down from 429.61 billion naira a week ago. The secured Open Buy Back closed at 18 percent, compared with 10.5 percent last week, six percentage points above the central bank's benchmark rate of 12 percent.  The overnight rate closed at 19 percent, against 10.75 percent last week, while call money rose to 20 percent, from 11 percent.
