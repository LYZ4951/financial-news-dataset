MADRID, March 14 (Reuters) - Zurich insurance company said on Friday it had signed onto the agreement between a building consortium led by Spain's Sacyr <SCYR.MC> and the Panama Canal Authority to complete the expansion of the waterway.

The project had been under threat because of a cost dispute between the canal authority and the builders.
