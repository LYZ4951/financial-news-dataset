March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed 41 classes of notes issued  under 14 FirstMac RMBS transactions. Fitch has also affirmed the rating of the  currency swap obligation on the class A-1 notes of FirstMac Mortgage Funding  Trust Series 1E-2007. All transactions are backed by pools of conforming  Australian residential mortgages sourced directly or by way of third-party  introducers. The mortgages were originated in the name of nominee companies on  behalf of the trustee, FirstMac Fiduciary Services Pty Ltd, and sold to the  various trusts by FirstMac warehouses. The full list of rating actions can be  found at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect Fitch's view that available credit enhancement supports  the notes at their current ratings, the agency's expectations of Australia's  economic conditions, and that the credit quality and performance of the  underlying loans have remained within the agency's expectations. All transactions are paying down on a sequential basis with principal  collections being allocated to the senior notes with the exception of FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1E-2007, FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series  2-2008, FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1-2010 and the Class A and AB  notes in FirstMac Bond Series 2-2005 Trust and FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust  Series 1-2007. FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1E-2007 is expected to  revert to sequential pay down starting from the investment payment date in March  2014. The amortisation of the notes has resulted in improvements in credit  enhancement. As at end-January 2013, 30+ days arrears ranged between 0.1% for FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 2E-2013 and 3.4% for FirstMac Bond Series 2-2005  Trust. Since closing 231 loans have defaulted and originated a loss across the  outstanding Fitch rated transactions. Lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) has paid  86.6% of these losses and the rest has been covered either by excess spread or  by the originator. The reported weighted average current loan-to-value ratio (WA LVR) ranged from  58.9% (FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1E-2007) to 71.2% (FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1-2009). Indexation was negative for FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1-2010, as the WA LVR increased to 74.3% from  73.3% due to geographical concentration in Queensland and the seasoning of the  loans. FirstMac Bond Series 1E-2006 Trust benefitted the most from indexation  with WA LVR improving to 60.5% from 69.4%. FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust  Series 1E-2007 had the lowest indexed WA LVR (52.3%). The pools contain a significant portion of loans collateralised by investment  properties, ranging from 37.6% (FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 2E-2013)  to 66.9% (FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1-2007). The portion of  interest-only loans is also relatively high ranging from 26.9% (FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1E-2007) to 70.0% (FirstMac Bond Series 1C-2006). FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1-2007 has a significant portion of low  doc loans (85.9%). The portion of low-doc loans is limited in other  transactions, ranging from 17.6% (FirstMac Bond Series 1C-2006 to 1.1% (FirstMac  Bond Series 2-2005 Trust). The following have no low-doc loans: FirstMac Bond  Series 1E-2006 Trust, FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series 1E-2007, FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 2-2011, FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust Series  1E-2013, FirstMac Mortgage Funding Trust RMBS Series 3-2012 and FirstMac  Mortgage Funding Trust Series 2E-2013. All transactions have LMI provided by one or more of the following insurers; QBE  Lenders' Mortgage Insurance Limited (Insurer Financial Strength rating:  AA-/Stable), Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd, and Housing Loan  Insurance Corporation. No transactions have experienced any losses to date.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The sequential pay-down has enhanced credit enhancement for senior notes,  especially for well-seasoned transactions. As at end-January 2014, the senior  notes could withstand multiples of latest-reported arrears. Class A notes remain  independent of a downgrade to the LMI provider's rating. Class AB notes of  recently originated transactions remain sensitive to any change in the LMI  providers' ratings. Initial Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are  further discussed in the New Issue reports listed under "Related Research".
