MILAN, March 14 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> rose 2.4 pct in early trading on Friday after a newspaper reported that U.S. private equity firm JC Flowers was considering buying a stake in the bank from its main shareholder foundation.

According to Il Messaggero newspaper, the U.S. firm has been studying the possible move for three months and could lead a consortium of institutional investors. A Milan-based trader said the share move was due to the report.
