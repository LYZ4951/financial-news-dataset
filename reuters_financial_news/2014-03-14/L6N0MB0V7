LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Russia's debt insurance costs hit their highest in nearly two years on Friday as concerns grew about the impact of possible western sanctions on the country, ahead of this weekend's referendum in Crimea.

The 5-year credit default swap rate rose 18 basis points from Thursday's close to 285 bps, the highest since June 2012, according to Markit. Russia's 2020 dollar sovereign bond fell more than 1 cent on the dollar to 100.75 <RU050495434=>, its lowest since Oct 2011.
