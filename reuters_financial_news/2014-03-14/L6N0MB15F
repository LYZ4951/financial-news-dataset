MOSCOW, March 14 (Reuters) - Concerns that the East-West stand-off over Ukraine will hit Russia's economy look set to overshadow a strong fourth-quarter performance by mobile carrier MTS <MBT.N> when it reports results next week, clouding prospects for its growth this year.

Ukraine, at the centre of a political upheaval in which Russia's involvement has raised the prospect of sanctions, is the second-biggest market for Russia's top mobile operator. It accounts for around 10 percent of sales and 12 percent of core profit. Smaller Russian rival Vimpelcom <VIP.O> last week announced a more than $2 billion impairment charge that the company said reflected changed expectations of future cashflow and political and macroeconomic risk in Ukraine, taking it to a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.7 billion.

Deutsche Bank analyst Igor Semenov said the Ukraine developments could pose risks to MTS's growth guidance. Last month, MTS already warned that its sales growth could slow during the next three years as a weakening domestic economy curtails consumer demand. [ID:nL2N0L908T] Since then, Russia's moves in Ukraine's Crimea region have led to a sharp fall in the rouble and predictions from some economists that Russia could fall into recession. The West is considering sanctions that could impact Russia's economy. "The main indication of the developments around Ukraine at the macro level for Russia is likely to be a significant rise in capital outflows, which adversely affects the currency as well as the growth trajectory," Deutsche's Semenov wrote in a note. Analysts at Citi and VTB Capital also noted that MTS could be hit by hryvnia devaluation against the rouble - the company's reporting currency. For the fourth quarter, MTS was expected to report a 13 percent drop in net profit to 14.8 billion roubles ($406 million), according to the average of forecasts from 13 banks and brokerages. The lower earnings would be in part because of a high base effect as MTS had recorded a foreign exchange gain in the fourth quarter of 2012, while its core profit and sales are expected to be strong. Analysts see an operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) rising 6 percent and sales rising 5 percent thanks to growing mobile data revenues and increased subscriber base in Russia, the poll showed.
