March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned South Africa-based MMI Group Limited's [[FSRJM.UL] (MMI, IFS 'AA+(zaf)'/Stable) issue of subordinated debt securities of ZAR1.5bn an 'A+(zaf)' final rating, in line with Fitch's standard notching practices.  The assignment of the final rating follows the completion of the bond issue and  receipt of documents conforming to the information previously received. The  final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 7 March 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated two notches below MMI's National Long-term rating of  'AA(zaf)', reflecting subordination and the coupon deferral features. The notes include a floating-rate note with a 10-year maturity, callable after  five years (MMIG01), and a fixed-rate note with a 12-year maturity callable  after seven years (MMIG02). The floating-rate coupon of 3-month JIBAR plus 146  basis points is payable quarterly and the fixed rate coupon of 10.065%  semi-annually. The notes include a mandatory interest deferral feature, which is  triggered when the company's level of regulatory minimum capital requirement is  breached.  The subordinated debt has been structured for Tier 2 own funds eligibility  according to QIS3 specifications under the Solvency Assessment and Management  regime. According to Fitch's methodology, this subordinated bond is classified  as 100% capital due to regulatory override within Fitch's risk-based capital  calculation and is classified as 100% debt for the agency's financial leverage  calculations.  The new issue is expected by Fitch to increase financial leverage on a pro-forma  basis to 13.6% from 8.7% based on 31 December 2013 (end-1H14) figures, which  remains strong for MMI's rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade of the group's ratings, including the debt rating, could result from  a substantial deterioration in capitalisation, either based on Fitch's internal  assessment or on the statutory capital adequacy ratio (CAR), in particular if  MMI's reported CAR falls below 2.0x for a sustained period. A sustained poor operating performance driven by a decline in the equity market,  a reduction in new business margins relative to its peers or a material loss of  market share could also result in a downgrade, as would a weakened outlook for  South African life insurers based on further economic weakness.
