FRANKFURT, March 14 (Reuters) - Banks will return 10.075 billion euros ($14.03 billion) in crisis loans to the European Central Bank next week, a bigger sum than expected that keeps up the drain of extra cash out of the euro zone financial system.

The amount banks will repay on March 19 is less than this week's repayments of 11.401 billion euros but far more than the 4.0 billion forecast in a Reuters poll. [ECB/REFI] This week's repayment was the largest since the end of last year, when banks returned large chunks of the long-term loans they took from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012 to ride out a credit crunch.  The speed with which banks have been repaying the three-year loans has picked up over recent weeks again as confidence returns and banks start to rely less on central bank funding.   With banks repaying ECB crisis loans, the amount of excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> - the amount of money banks have beyond what they need for their day-to-day operations - is falling.  It stood at 144 billion euros on Friday. Excess liquidity peaked in early 2012 at around 800 billion euros. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said last month market participants were learning to adapt to an environment of less excess liquidity, "learning their way back to normality". On Friday, the ECB said 12 banks would repay 4.995 billion euros from the first LTRO on March 19, and seven banks would pay back 5.080 billion from the second LTRO.
