March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The risk of deflation is most significant, albeit still  low, for the eurozone among the world's major advanced economies (MAEs), Fitch  Ratings says. Eurozone inflation is already the lowest among MAEs, and policy  options to respond to potential deflationary shocks are more limited than  elsewhere.  We think the eurozone's economic recovery will continue in 2014-2015 (we  forecast 1.1% real GDP growth this year and 1.4% in 2015), as in other MAEs.  This would make an increase in domestic disinflationary pressures unlikely, as  we do not expect the negative output gap to widen further. But inflation was  just 0.8% in February 2014, compared with the ECB's target of below but close to  2%. And while the probable policy response by central banks is one reason we  think prolonged deflation is unlikely in any MAEs, the ECB is near the zero  lower bound of nominal interest rates, and could face political and legal  challenges if it tried to embark on quantitative easing.  In addition, regional inflation dispersion is limited. Inflation is below the  eurozone-wide target in core as well as peripheral countries. The lower the  average inflation, the longer and more costly will be the peripheral countries'  recovery of lost competitiveness.  We estimated seasonally adjusted, quarter-on-quarter annualised core inflation  for the eurozone, US, UK, and Japan as part of our quarterly "Global Economic  Outlook". Shorter-term rather than year-on-year indicators give an underlying  indicator of inflation rates if recent trends persisted for an extended period.  This indicator is lowest for the eurozone, at 0.7%-0.8%, slightly below that for  Japan.  Our underlying indicator is close to core year-on-year inflation, suggesting  that if there are no shocks a further decline in the eurozone's core inflation  is unlikely in the near term.  Nevertheless, the protracted adjustment in the periphery, combined with price  and wage stickiness, would add to the costs of periphery rebalancing and  increase the real value of the debt burden, and so could ultimately also add to  deflation risks. Overall, alongside likely central bank responses, we think a strengthening  economic recovery and anchored inflation expectations make protracted,  self-reinforcing deflation unlikely in the MAEs unless there are additional  shocks.
