HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - A probe into Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (Hibor) fixing has found material weakness in Swiss bank UBS's <UBSN.VX> internal controls and governance in the submission process, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said on Friday.

The probe also found that UBS failed to report its staff's misconduct to the HKMA, which the regulator said was unacceptable. However, the investigation did not find any evidence of collusion between banks to rig benchmark lending rates.
