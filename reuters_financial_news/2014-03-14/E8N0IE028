MADRID, March 14 (Reuters) - Spanish airline Iberia, part of International Airlines Group <ICAG.L> which also includes British Airways, said on Friday it had reached a preliminary agreement with unions representing its close to 8,000 ground staff.

The carrier, which is due to hold a news conference later on Friday to give details of the agreement, has recently reached other deals with cabin crew and pilots after restructuring and job cuts led to drawn-out disputes with staff. [ID:nL5N0LI2F4] [ID:nL6N0LU0Y9]
