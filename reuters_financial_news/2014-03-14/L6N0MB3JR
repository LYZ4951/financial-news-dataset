RABAT, March 14 (Reuters) - Morocco's foreign exchange regulator said on Friday it will let companies based in its finance and business hub, Casablanca Finance City, manage their assets in foreign currencies freely, in a bid to attract more foreign investment.

Morocco operates a tight currency exchange system that has put off foreign investors, hurting the government's attempts to attract more investment. "Companies under CFC status will have complete freedom in managing foreign currency assets," the Foreign Exchange Office said in a statement. The move will affect foreign investors and Moroccans living abroad, allowing them to invest in the country without being under the control of the regulator. Moroccan citizens in the country and Morocco-based companies will still come under the authority of the regulator, however. In a recent report, the IMF said Morocco would benefit from more exchange rate flexibility to make its economy more competitive and better able to absorb shocks.  The central bank plans to shift to a more flexible exchange system over the next three years. Earlier this year, Morocco eased rules for its citizens and non-exporting companies that want to open foreign exchange bank accounts. Moroccans can now put up to 40,000 dirhams ($5,000) in foreign currency into convertible bank accounts per year.
