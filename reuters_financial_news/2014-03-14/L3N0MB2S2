JAKARTA, March 14 (Reuters) - Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional (BTPN)<BTPN.JK> shares surged as much as 9 percent on Friday after Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group <8316.T> said it bought 919.3 million shares of the Indonesian lender.

Sumitomo paid 6,500 rupiah per share, a 44.8 percent premium to its closing price on Thursday, BTPN said in a stock exchange filing. Following the transaction, Sumitomo owns 2.3 trillion shares in Indonesia's seventh-biggest lender by market value. Last year, Sumitomo had agreed to buy up to 40 percent stake of BTPN, which is backed by TPG Capital <TPG.UL>, giving the Japanese bank a foothold in the fast-growing Southeast Asian economy. [ID:nT9N0CH08H] As of 0833 GMT, the lender's stock was up 5.6 percent. The broader Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> was up 2 percent, while the blue-chip index <.JKLQ45> was 2.8 percent higher.
