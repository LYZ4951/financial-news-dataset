MUMBAI, March 14 (Reuters) - India's four-day cash rate <INROND=> surged to a one-month high of 9.15 percent as banks rushed to cover their reserve needs ahead of a long weekend.

The one-day call rate closed on Thursday at 7.00/7.05 percent. Financial markets are shut on Monday for a public holiday. Tight liquidity was evident as banks' borrowing at the Reserve Bank of India's repo window climbed to a one-month high of 364.71 billion rupees ($5.97 billion) from 342.11 billion rupees on Thursday.
