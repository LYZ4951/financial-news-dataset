March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

General Motors Company's <GM.N> (GM) recall of faulty  ignition switches in 1.6 million vehicles primarily presents reputational risk  for the company, although follow-on costs could mount, according to Fitch  Ratings. A federal probe examining the length of time it took GM to announce the  recall and the near-continuous stream of negative headlines related to it could  exacerbate the situation. We do not currently expect the recall to have an  effect on GM's ratings or Outlook, but we are monitoring the situation closely  as more information becomes available. We believe direct costs associated with the recall, along with any associated  fines, will likely be manageable and will not affect the company's credit  profile. The cost of the part itself is estimated to be low and changing the  switch should be a simple and relatively quick process. We estimate that the  cost of the recall could be less than $100 million. We also view GM's offer of a  $500 incentive toward the purchase of a new vehicle as having a limited  financial impact on the company as well.  Any potential fine from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) would probably be capped at $35 million, which we view as quite  manageable given the company's cash generating capabilities. Legal costs associated with lawsuits that are likely to be filed are unknown and  could pose more of a risk. Lawsuits tied to accidents that occurred prior to  GM's 2009 bankruptcy may be considered prepetition claims, but the actual impact  on GM will depend on how the courts view these claims and what legal avenues  might be available to plaintiffs. Any settlement costs could be significant as  well. GM will also incur legal costs associated with its own internal  investigation into the matter. The longer term impact to the brand will largely depend on the company's  handling of the situation. The vehicles affected by the recall have all been out  of production for a number of years, and there are no indications that any  vehicles currently in production have similar issues. However, potential  customers could be concerned about the internal workings of the company that led  to the apparent delay in deciding to recall the vehicles. GM's management will  need to convince potential customers that the internal issues that led to the  recall delay have been rectified.
