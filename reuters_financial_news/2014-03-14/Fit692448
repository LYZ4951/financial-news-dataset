March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings to  Indonesia-based PT Astra Sedaya Finance's [ASTFI.UL] (ASF; AAA(idn)/Stable) proposed senior  unsecured bonds, the third tranche to be issued this year under the programme,  as follows:  - bonds with maturity of three and four years assigned National Long-Term Rating  of 'AAA(idn)' - bonds with maturity of 370 days assigned National Short-Term Rating of  'F1+(idn)'.   The bond issue will be up to IDR1.95trn in size and the proceeds will be used to  support the company's business growth.  'AAA' National Long-Term Ratings denote the highest rating assigned by Fitch on  its national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers  or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other  issuers or obligations in the same country. 'F1' National Short-Term Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The bonds are rated at the same level as ASF's National Long-Term and Short-Term  Ratings. This is because they constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior  unsecured obligations of ASF and rank equally with all other unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations.  ASF's ratings reflect Fitch's expectation of continued strong support and  commitment from its majority shareholder, PT Astra International Tbk <ASII.JK> (AI).  Fitch's classification of ASF as a core subsidiary of AI captures ASF's  strategic importance to the parent's car manufacturing and distributing business  in Indonesia. ASF provides direct financing services for buyers who purchase  AI's cars, playing an important role in supporting AI's sales.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Any changes in ASF's National Long-Term and Short-Term ratings would affect the  issue ratings.
