March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Ukrainian bank capital ratios have come under  more pressure than liquidity positions as a result of the country's crisis,  Fitch Ratings says. Further asset quality deterioration represents a significant  risk for credit profiles, while deposit outflows have been largely manageable so  far.  According to data published by the National Bank of Ukraine, the banking  sector's aggregate regulatory capital ratio decreased to 15.8% at 1 March from  18.4% on 1 February this year. We calculate that the reduction was due in equal  proportion to a fall in the absolute amount of capital (by 8%) and an increase  in risk-weighted assets (also by 8%). We attribute the asset increase to the higher hryvnia value of foreign currency  loans as a result of the 25% depreciation during February. The reduction in  capital was probably due to a combination of greater loan impairment reserves,  an increase in uncollected accrued interest (which is deducted from regulatory  capital) and losses on open currency positions. Fitch expects bank asset quality to deteriorate further as a result of economic  dislocations, recession, depreciation of the hryvnia and - in some cases -  potential redistribution of economic influence and assets. This in turn will hit  capital ratios, although the severity and timing of the impact will depend on  the evolution of the crisis and the degree of regulatory forbearance extended by  the National Bank. Capital ratios at Ukrainian banks already benefit from  relatively low reserve coverage of problem loan exposures.  Overall deposit outflows have been manageable, in part due to withdrawal  restrictions. The National Bank imposed a limit for daily cash withdrawals from  retail and corporate foreign-currency accounts at UAH15,000 (USD1,515)  equivalent. In addition, many banks imposed significantly tighter caps for daily  withdrawals from ATMs.  Based on available data from rated Ukrainian banks, we calculate that these  institutions suffered average deposit outflows (adjusted for exchange rate  effects) of 9% between 1 January and early March, with most of this outflow  coming after 1 February. Withdrawals for the banking system as a whole may have  been higher than at rated banks, which are mainly foreign or state-owned, and so  probably somewhat less prone to deposit runs. Withdrawals were somewhat higher from corporate than from retail accounts as  businesses have tended to react rather more quickly than households to changing  financial conditions. Among retail clients, outflows were higher from hryvnia  accounts than from foreign-currency ones, as people converted local currency  into US dollars and were restricted in access to hard currency withdrawals  Liquidity positions have held up reasonably well, with highly liquid assets -  comprising cash and equivalents, net short-term interbank positions and  unencumbered securities eligible for repo with the central bank - at most rated  banks still equal to about 20%-25% of customer deposits as of early March.  National Bank disclosures also show little change in sector liquidity ratios at  1 March compared to 1 February, with the current liquidity ratio (essentially,  reported assets to one month/liabilities to one month) even rising to 85% from  82%. The regulator's facility to fully replace deposit outflows with new  liquidity provides a backstop in case of accelerated outflows, although we  understand this has not been heavily used so far.
