NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - The three biggest U.S. discount brokerage firms said their stock trading volumes jumped in February from a year earlier, an indication that confidence by small investors in the stock market is continuing to gain after being fairly moribund in 2013.

Charles Schwab Corp <SCHW.N>, the biggest of the three, trailed its competitors in monthly gains, though all three had double-digit increases in February compared with the same month in 2013. San Francisco-based Schwab, however, saw trading by its 9.1 million brokerage account holders fall by 5 percent in February from January, to a daily average of 556,000, it reported on Friday. That compares with a 1 percent monthly gain from TD Ameritrade Holding's <AMTD.N> 6.0 million account holders, who averaged 501,000 daily trades in February. It was the first time in TD Ameritrade's history that trades breached the 500,000 level. E*Trade Financial Corp <ETFC.O> on Friday said its 3 million brokerage account clients averaged just over 201,000 trades in February, up 2.8 percent from January.  Institutional investors monitor the ups and downs of trading volume by retail investors as a barometer of market confidence - which they can bet against or with, depending on their analysis of small-investor sentiment - as well as of the health of the brokerage firms. All three firms have signaled that small-investor confidence at the start of 2014 is strong after many sat out 2013, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index gained about 30 percent.  Compared with February 2013, average daily trades by Schwab investors last month gained 10 percent. At TD Ameritrade and E*Trade, February trading volume soared 30 percent and 32 percent, respectively, from a year earlier. The S&P 500 was up 4 percent in February, bringing its gains for the first two months of the year to 23 percent. Schwab's chief financial officer, Joe Martinetto, said in a commentary on the firm's website that raw trading data "tell only a fraction of the (customer) engagement story," noting that a growing number of customers are paying Schwab fees for broad advice about achieving their financial goals instead of seeking direction on pure stock and bond trading. As a general rule, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade clients are more active traders than Schwab, said analysts and a Schwab spokesman. Schwab disclosed another indicator of growing investor interest in stocks. After a year in which brokerage firms of all types saw rising cash balances in client accounts, Schwab clients poured a net $3.3 billion into stock and bond mutual funds offered by the company while withdrawing $318.4 million from money-market funds, which are nearly equivalent to cash. For a second straight month, international mutual funds attracted more money from Schwab clients - $2.5 billion in January and February - than any other category. Taxable bond funds were the second biggest gainers, with net inflows of $2.3 billion.  Firms such as Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E*Trade that attract many self-directed investors looking for low commissions began the year stronger than some of their full-service competitors. Last month the head of Wells Fargo Advisors, the third largest U.S. firm by number of brokers, said clients were keeping near-record amounts of cash in their accounts while the firm was behind budget in trading commissions.
