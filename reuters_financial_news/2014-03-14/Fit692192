March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed German life insurer Lebensversicherung von 1871 a.G. Muenchen's (LV 1871) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'A+' with a Stable Outlook.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects LV 1871's strong market position in German disability  insurance and its strong capitalisation. Fitch's view on the company's  capitalisation is based both on the level of the regulatory solvency ratio and  the agency's own internal risk-based measures. Fitch expects LV 1871 to maintain  both its market position and strong capitalisation in 2014.  Fitch also views positively that LV 1871 has maintained its robust new business  figures which led to strong growth in recent years. These factors are offset by  the life insurer's relatively small size, the low investment yield environment  in Germany and lack of geographical and line of business diversification.  Due to the large proportion of disability business underwritten by LV 1871, the  company is well positioned to mitigate the impact of the current low interest  rate environment. The German life insurance sector remains dominated by  guaranteed interest rate (GIR) policies. On average, the industry needs to  achieve an investment return slightly above 3% to meet GIR payments. In a  sustained low interest rate environment, LV 1871's underwriting earnings from  its disability business would significantly mitigate any potential challenges in  meeting GIR payments, which Fitch views positively. LV 1871 achieved a profit of EUR2.7m in its 2012 consolidated accounts after it  reported a small loss of EUR0.7m in 2011. Fitch expects LV 1871's consolidated  bottom-line profitability to continue to improve.  LV 1871's group regulatory solvency margin improved to 171% at end-2012 from  146% at end-2011. The significant increase in the margin was primarily driven by  including unrealised capital gains on real estate investments for the first  time. Fitch expects LV 1871 to maintain its level of capitalisation at end-2013  and in 2014. In 2012, the LV 1871 group reported gross written premiums (GWP) of EUR862.2m  (2011: EUR735.5m). Due to the fact that LV 1871 group's premium income  benefitted from exceptionally strong single premium business in 2012, Fitch  expects a notable decline in the consolidated group's GWP. However, premium  income likely exceeded the agency's expectation of EUR760m-EUR790m in 2013.  In 2013, LV 1871 achieved a net investment return rate of 4.4% (2012: 4.6%)  which was in line with the German life sector average in 2012. Investment income  was more than sufficient to meet the guarantees and the costs for the additional  actuarial reserve (Zinszusatzreserve) in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, LV 1871's  reinvestment rate within fixed-income investments was higher than its average  guaranteed interest rate.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating drivers for a downgrade include a decline in LV 1871's strong  franchise in the disability line as evidenced, for example, by declining new  business levels over a period of time or the group regulatory solvency margin  (including unrealised gains on real estate) falling below 170% for a sustained  period.  Fitch views an upgrade of the rating as unlikely in the near term due to LV  1871's relatively small size and limited diversification, and hence its  vulnerability to external effects.
