March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Germany-based  Allianz SE's <ALVG.DE> Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating and Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-'. At the same time, the agency has affirmed  Allianz's main subsidiaries' IFS rating at 'AA'. The Outlook for all ratings is  Stable. A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects Allianz's strong technical profitability, strong  consolidated group capital position, broad diversification by geography and  product, and solid business position in its key markets. In addition, the  group's ratings also benefit from an investment mix of sound credit quality.  Partially offsetting these rating factors are currently suppressed technical  profitability in the non-life business segment in the US and a challenging  medium-term outlook for some of Allianz's life markets.  The subdued outlook for economic growth in the eurozone, low interest rates and  a possible re-intensification of the peripheral eurozone debt crisis create a  challenging operating environment. For 2014 Fitch expects that sound  underwriting profitability from the non-life business will help Allianz offset  the effects of likely pressure on earnings from life insurance and investments.  The group's strong core capitalisation remained comfortable in 2013 with  shareholders' funds of EUR50.1bn (2012: EUR50.4bn restated) and the consolidated  regulatory solvency ratio improving to 182% (2012: 181%, when adjusted for  accounting changes).  For 2013 Allianz reported an operating profit of EUR10.1bn (+7.8%), composed of  EUR5.3bn (+14.2%) from property/casualty insurance, EUR3.2bn (+7%) from asset  management, and EUR2.7bn (-8%) from life/health insurance. The combined ratio  improved to 94.3% (96.2%), despite higher claims from weather-related losses. In  2013 net profit attributable to shareholders increased by 14.6% (EUR6bn).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: - Deterioration within the peripheral eurozone countries leading to a decline in  respective bond and other asset prices  - A decline in Allianz's regulatory solvency ratio to below 160%   An upgrade is unlikely over the medium term, but upgrade triggers include: - A sustained significant increase in the regulatory solvency ratio to above  200%  - A sustained strong improvement in profitability with a non-life combined ratio  consistently below 95% Allianz is one of the largest insurance groups in Europe. IFRS gross written  premiums were EUR72.1bn and total assets stood at EUR712bn at end-2013. The  group is active in both the non-life and life/health businesses as well as in  asset management and has a strong business position and franchise.
