March 14 (Reuters) - Shares of Liberty Media Corp <LMCA.O> rose as much as 9.4 percent after the company, controlled by chairman John Malone, canceled an offer to buy the rest of satellite radio provider Sirius XM Holdings Inc <SIRI.O>.

Shares of Sirius, 53 percent owned by Liberty, rose 3.2 percent in afternoon trading after the company said on Friday it would resume its $2 billion share buyback program, which had been suspended in connection with Liberty's offer. [ID:nPn2ND3CL] Buying the rest of Sirius would have beefed up Liberty's balance sheet. [ID:nL2N0MA2BI] That would have helped Malone finance a now-defunct bid by Charter Communications Inc <CHTR.O>, another of his companies, for Time Warner Cable Inc <TWC.N>. "The difficulties may have proved too much," Northland Capital Markets analyst Tom Eagan wrote in a note. Although Liberty Media dropped its bid, it said on Thursday it was still in discussions with Sirius's independent directors. Some analysts said Liberty could still pursue a transaction with Sirius. Liberty said on Thursday it planned to split its cable and media holdings into two tracking stocks - Liberty Broadband Group and Liberty Media Group - later this year. Liberty Media will own the Sirius stake, apart from other assets such as investments in Live Nation Entertainment Inc <LYV.N> and the Atlanta Braves baseball team. Liberty Media could ultimately merge with Sirius as a pure satellite radio entity, Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan said. Barclays Equity Research analyst Kannan Venkateshwar said Liberty could also spin off its Sirius stake via a Reverse Morris Trust, a transaction that allows a parent company to sell its unit in a tax-efficient manner.
