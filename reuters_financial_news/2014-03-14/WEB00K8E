PARIS, March 14 (Reuters) - A board sub-committee of Vivendi <VIV.PA> charged with evaluating two competing bids for telecom unit SFR decided on Thursday that it preferred the one from local cable group Numericable <NUME.PA>, said two people close to the situation.

The four-person committee was led by Henri Lachmann, former CEO of Schneider Electric and administrator at Vivendi since 1998.
