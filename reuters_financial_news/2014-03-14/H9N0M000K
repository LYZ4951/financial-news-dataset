BEIJING, March 14 (Reuters) - Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> shares slid as much as 6.4 pct amid reports that China's central bank has called for a halt to online credit card use.

The report that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) had issued a statement telling China CITIC Bank Corp <601998.SS>, which operates virtual credit cards in cooperation with Tencent and ecommerce firm Alibaba Group Holding [IPO-ALIB.N], was first reported by 21st Century Business Herald. Alibaba and Tencent later confirmed to Reuters they had received the notice about the PBOC's plan. A PBOC spokesman said the bank was investigating the reports.
