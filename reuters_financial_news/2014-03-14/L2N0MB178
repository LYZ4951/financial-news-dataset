SAO PAULO, March 14 (Reuters) - European private equity firm Apax Partners LLP wants to invest up to 10 percent of the $7.6 billion raised for its eighth fund in Latin America, with a focus on Brazil despite high prices for takeover targets, a senior executive said on Friday.

London-based Apax, which late last year opened an office in São Paulo to oversee investments in the region, will seek potential targets in the consumer and retail, business services, telecommunications and technology sectors, said Walter Piacsek Jr., the firm's head for the region. Apparel retail chains, as well as services contractors in sectors such as oil and gas, are on the radar of Apax bankers, Piacsek said, without elaborating. The outlook for long-term investments in Brazil remains favorable despite a series of economic policy decisions that sparked an abrupt decline in confidence in the past two years, he added. Waning investor confidence in Brazil, however, has done little to lower the price for potential takeover targets, said Piacsek, a former co-head of wholesale banking at Banco Votorantim SA. Many private equity bankers say that, despite the Brazilian currency's 14 percent drop over the past 18 months, Brazilian assets are still expensive when measured in U.S. dollars. "Valuations receded a bit, but very little," Piacsek said. "Brazil is not cheap. Well, at least the macro expectations are not as exuberant as they were just a few years back." While Apax usually invests an average $400 million to $500 million in each transaction globally, in Brazil the so-called ticket for an acquisition will be a minimum $150 million. Money earmarked for a single acquisition in the region could be significantly higher, if done in partnership with other investments firms, for instance, Piacsek added.  STRUGGLE TO DIVEST Brazil is entering its fourth year of weak economic growth, with inflation running at the high end of the government's target range and borrowing losing steam in the wake of a credit boom. Still, Piacsek said attractive business opportunities remain, thanks to a stable job market, the need to increase productivity and repressed demand for healthcare and other consumer services. Apax's foray in Brazil comes as peers in the buyout industry are struggling to divest some of their Brazilian investments through initial public offerings. "For investors with a sharp long-term view, investing in Brazil is still good. But should the macro imbalances and uncertainty continue, that view begins to be put into question,"  Piacsek said, adding that Apax is not concerned with exits in Brazil at this point. Apax, which has over $40 billion in committed capital globally, bought information technology company Tivit Terceirização de Tecnologia e Serviços SA in late 2010, which was its first investment in Brazil. It also controls Grupo Confidence, a financial services firm, among other companies in Brazil.
