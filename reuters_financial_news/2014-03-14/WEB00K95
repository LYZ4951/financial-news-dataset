PARIS, March 14 (Reuters) - Vivendi <VIV.PA> said on Friday that it would enter exclusive talks to sell its SFR telecom unit to Altice <ATCE.AS>, the parent company of French cable group Numericable <NUME.PA>.

The talks will last three weeks, and the board of Vivendi will meet again at their conclusion to decide on the future of SFR, France's second-biggest telecom operator. "The board considers their (Numericable's) offer to be the most pertinent for the group's shareholders and employees, and carries lower execution risk," the company said in a statement. Vivendi confirmed that the Numericable offer included 11.75 billion euros ($16.36 billion) in cash and a 32 percent share in the combined listed entity.
