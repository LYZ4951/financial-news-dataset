SAN FRANCISCO, March 14 (Reuters) - Twitter-like messaging service Weibo Corp filed on Friday to raise $500 million via a U.S. initial public offering, as Chinese companies flock to the American market to take advantage of soaring valuations.

The messaging service owned by China's Sina Corp <SINA.O> hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to manage its U.S. debut, which it said would boost brand recognition and help retain talent.
