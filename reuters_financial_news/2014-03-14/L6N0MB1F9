LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Inflows into emerging bond funds outpaced outflows last week for the first time since September, but equity funds saw net outflows for a record 20th week, banks said on Friday, citing EPFR data.

The Boston-based fund tracker, which releases data to clients late on Thursday, said emerging market bond funds attracted modest net inflows of $560 million in the week to March 12. Emerging market equity funds, however, saw $2.51 billion in net outflows. The bond inflows were all in local currency debt, while hard currency bonds continued to see slight outflows. Some of the so-called Fragile Five currencies, such as the Indian rupee <INR=> and the Indonesian rupiah <IDR=> have enjoyed a recovery in recent weeks. Emerging debt funds have seen outflows of $11 billion this year, however, compared with $14 billion for the whole of last year. Emerging equity outflows already total $34 billion, compared with $14 billion last year. A slowdown in China, the world's largest emerging economy, as well as a scaling back of U.S. monetary stimulus that supported risky assets and domestic crises from Caracas to Kiev have driven capital from emerging markets.
