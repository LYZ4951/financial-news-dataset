LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - European equity capital markets have begun 2014 with their strongest annual start since 2007, Thomson Reuters weekly data showed on Friday, as a rash of initial public offerings (IPOs) helped business surge 38 percent on the same period last year.

European IPO activity has tripled year-on-year to $12 billion, helped by the flotations this week of Denmark's ISS <ISSAS.CO> and Britain's Poundland <PLND.L> among others. [ID:nL6N0M41SF] [ID:nL6N0MA0SP] [ID:nL6N0M90PF] Investors worldwide have rushed to cash in on Europe's nascent recovery this year, despite the turmoil in Ukraine which has delayed several listings by Russian companies. [ID:nL2N0MA0AC] Asia Pacific listings are up 74 percent so far this year. Goldman Sachs <GS.N> leads the rankings with a 12.9 percent share of global equity and equity-related deals, processing 66 deals so far this year.  Separate data from Thomson Reuters on Thursday showed that London is a particular hotspot for equity capital markets. The city's stock exchange has seen listings of $5.9 billion this year, the highest since the first quarter of 2007.
