HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - Shares in New World China Land Ltd <0917.HK> were set to jump 30.9 percent when trade resumed on Friday after its parent, New World Development Co Ltd <0017.HK>, said it planned to take it private at a 32 percent premium to the previous closing price.

Hong Kong developer New World Development said it would take its flagship property arm in China private for HK$18.6 billion ($2.4 billion) with the aim of simplifying the group structure and creating more flexibility for it to manage the business of the China-focused property unit.
