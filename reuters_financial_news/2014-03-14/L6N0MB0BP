DUBAI, March 14 (Reuters) - Africa-focused investor Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) is buying 33 percent of Atlas Bottling Corp, an Algerian firm which bottles PepsiCo Inc's <PEP.N> drinks, it said on Friday.

ECP is buying the stake from Group Mehri, a prominent Algerian business family which owns Atlas, ECP said in a statement, without specifying how much it would spend on the acquisition. The investment is part of an $80 million expansion plan at Atlas, which will use the money from ECP and debt from commercial banks to increase its bottling capacity, build a new production site and develop new product categories, ECP said.
