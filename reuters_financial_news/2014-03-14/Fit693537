March 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Singapore-based  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp's <OCBC.SI> (OCBC; AA-/Stable) proposed AUD400m floating rate  notes due 2017 an expected rating of 'AA-(EXP)'. The notes will be issued under  OCBC's USD10bn global medium-term note programme. The final rating is subject to  the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received. The proceeds will be used for OCBC's general corporate purposes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The senior notes are rated at the same level as OCBC's 'AA-' Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR). This is because the notes will constitute direct,  unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations of the bank, and will rank  equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the notes is sensitive to changes in OCBC's IDR.
