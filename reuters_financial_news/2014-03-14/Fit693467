Paul Taylor, President and CEO of Fitch Group, commented: "We are excited to add  BMI's world-class research, data, and analytical capabilities to Fitch's global  suite of financial information services. BMI and Fitch share a commitment to  pairing robust data with sophisticated analysis to produce content that is  insightful and accessible."
