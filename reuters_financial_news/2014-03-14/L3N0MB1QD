SHANGHAI, March 14 (Reuters) - China's money rates looked set to end the week mixed on Friday, with the benchmark seven-day repo rising slightly from the previous week but the overnight and 14-day repo rates extending their slide on easing money expectations.

Beijing has signalled that it will ease up its pressure on the interbank market as the economy shows signs of instability, with exports posting a dramatic slide in February and manufacturing growth continuing to slow. [ID:nL3N0MA1E2] At the same time, sources say that regulators are increasing administrative pressure on banks to reduce lending to troubled industries, and have also signalled they are going to allow more debt and bond defaults going forward. [ID:nL3N0MA2XC] For investors, the question is whether this balancing act will work.  Previous crackdowns on the short-term funding market resulted in dramatic funding spikes, which traders said was highly effective in encouraging Chinese banks to back out of the dabbling in the riskier forms of shadow banking and get pickier about lending. Official figures showed bank lending plummeted in February, as did Total Social Financing (TSF), a homegrown indicator that measures both formal and shadow banking activities. But traders caution that the seasonal factors, especially the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in early February, have likely distorted figures to some degree. Thus, economists are debating whether the central bank will take stronger steps to stimulate the economy, including a possible cut to reserve requirement ratios at banks, which would inject a massive amount of long-term base money into the system. Markets continue to bet that the bank will not make any changes to benchmark interest rates.
