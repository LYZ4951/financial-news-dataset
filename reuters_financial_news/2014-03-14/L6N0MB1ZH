MILAN, March 14 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc <BLK.N>, the world's largest money manager, has raised its stake in UniCredit <CRDI.MI> to become the Italian bank's largest shareholder, according to a filing posted on market watchdog Consob's website on Friday.

Investors in listed Italian companies must notify Consob if their stake exceeds 5 percent.  BlackRock also recently increased its holding in UniCredit's domestic rival Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> to 5 percent, and is thus Intesa's second biggest investor.
