MEXICO CITY, March 15 (Reuters) - Creditors to Oceanografia, a Mexican oil services company at the center of an alleged fraud that forced Citigroup <C.N> to cut its 2013 profit, have seized a ship that was used as collateral for debt issued by the company.

Norsk Tillitsmann, the Oslo-based trustee for some of Oceanografia's bonds [OCNGR.UL], is preparing to sell the ship, OSA Goliath, to recoup funds for lenders, according to a letter published on Saturday on the trustee's website. The ship was seized on Friday in Aruban waters on Norsk Tillitsmann's request, the letter said. A spokesman for Oceanografia, whose main business was providing services for Mexico's state oil company Pemex[PEMX.UL], did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Citigroup said last month it uncovered at least $400 million in bogus loans to Oceanografia at its Mexican subsidiary, Banamex. [ID:nL1N0LX187] Oceanografia had borrowed from Banamex using expected payments from Pemex as collateral. Mexico's government has taken control of Oceanografia and begun a criminal investigation.
