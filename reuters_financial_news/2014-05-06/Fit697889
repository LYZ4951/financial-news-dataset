May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says some recovery in eurozone periphery  sovereign ratings is possible in a benign scenario of economic recovery and  declining debt ratios. Nevertheless, the agency is generally cautious about the  medium-term outlook for the eurozone as many countries face a long period of  convalescence and the risk of relapse. Fitch has taken several positive rating actions on sovereigns in the eurozone  periphery as the intensity of the crisis has eased and countries have started to  repair damage to their creditworthiness. These include upgrades for Greece (May  2013) and Spain (April 2014); and positive changes in Outlooks (including  Negative to Stable) for Ireland (November 2012), Cyprus, Italy and Portugal (all  April 2014) and Slovenia (May 2014), as well as Belgium (January 2013).  Positive rating actions reflect an end to recessions, a move into current  account surpluses, a narrowing in budget deficits, enhanced financing  flexibility and market access, reduced tail risk of eurozone exits, structural  reforms and gains in competitiveness, an easing in banking sector risks and  reforms at the eurozone level. Spreads on eurozone periphery government bonds have narrowed sharply since  summer 2012. However, market spreads have been more volatile than our ratings  through the crisis and, having 'overshot', had more ground to make up. For  example, spreads on ten-year sovereign bonds peaked at over 1100bp for Ireland  (the lowest Fitch rating was 'BBB+') and over 550bp for Spain (lowest 'BBB'),  Italy ('BBB+') and Slovenia ('BBB+').  To the extent that Fitch has a different view on credit fundamentals from the  market, as it has done at various stages of the eurozone crisis, it remains to  be seen whether ratings are 'too low' or investors are not being adequately  compensated for credit risk.  Fitch's ratings are purely a measure of the  relative rank ordering of credit risk, while current low bond yields may also  reflect weak growth prospects, low inflation, anticipated monetary policy  easing, strong market liquidity and a search for yield in a low interest rate  environment. Cutting budget deficits and stabilising then reducing public debt ratios would  be a key driver of rating upgrades. Our new report today highlights that even  with favourable economic conditions and strong fiscal policy discipline this  will be challenging. It explains other potential triggers including: sustained  and balance economic recovery, structural reforms, a track record of secure  market access, reducing net external and private debt ratios, lowering  unemployment, strengthening banking systems, continuing eurozone level  institutional reforms and avoiding political shocks. Further upgrades of eurozone periphery sovereigns are possible in a scenario in  which these triggers are met. However, ratings could stagnate or even decline if  growth is weak and debt ratios flat-line or keep rising.  Fitch believes that Ireland, Portugal and Spain have the greatest medium-term  potential, in a favourable scenario, for multi-notch rating recoveries as their  ratings fell further in the crisis (7-8 notches) than Italy and Slovenia (4-5  notches) and they have suffered less severe damage and are less exposed to  downside risks than Cyprus and Greece (which defaulted and are still in EU/IMF  programmes). We do not envisage any sovereigns in the eurozone periphery  recapturing pre-crisis rating levels in the foreseeable future. This reflects  not only the long and difficult adjustment path ahead, but also the legacy of  the crisis.  Some lessons can be drawn from the eurozone crisis. Pre-crisis credit  fundamentals were not as robust as they originally appeared. Rates of GDP growth  were unsustainably fuelled by credit growth and high capital inflows, budget  balances were flattered by cyclical upswings, banking sectors were more risky  than they appeared, access to market financing was more fragile, and there were  design flaws in European Economic and Monetary Union. Moreover, Greece  misreported its public finance figures.  Finally, our report also looks at historical precedents of how quickly countries  recovered rating notches lost in crises. We looked at 10 Fitch-rated sovereigns  countries ranging from Korea (1997) to Iceland (2007) that experienced  downgrades of three or more notches within two years, followed by a recovery in  ratings above the 'B' range. These countries saw an average downgrade of 5.9  notches, and recovered an average of 4.1 of those lost notches within five years  of the start of the crisis (as measured by the year of the first downgrade) and  5.3 of them within ten years.  However, we also looked at how challenging it is for developed countries to  achieve large sustained reductions in government debt ratios. Since 1970, there  were only nine episodes of reductions in government debt/GDP ratios of at least  20pp over an eight year period. And these were in environments of stronger GDP  growth than is likely in the eurozone today. The report entitled 'Eurozone Periphery: Rating Recovery Potential' is available  on www.fitchratings.com.
