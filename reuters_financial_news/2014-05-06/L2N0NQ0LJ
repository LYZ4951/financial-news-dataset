SAO PAULO, May 6 (Reuters) - Grupo BTG Pactual SA <BBTG11.SA>, Latin America's largest listed investment bank, probably saw first-quarter profit rising after declining compensation expenses helped offset sliding revenue from asset management and principal investments, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.

The lender, controlled by billionaire financier André Esteves, probably had net income of 797 million reais ($359 million) in the quarter, about 3.8 percent more than in the prior three months, according to the average estimates of three analysts in the poll.  Compared with the same period a year earlier, profit soared 30 percent, reflecting an across-the-board gain in revenues, the poll added. Results will be released on Tuesday after markets close. Esteves and other executives are scheduled to discuss results with investors at a conference call the following day. Return on equity, or a measure of profitability that gauges how well the bank spend shareholder money, probably ended the first quarter at 19.4 percent, up from 19.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and 16.9 percent a year earlier, the poll estimated. Esteves points to long-term annualized ROEs, as the gauge is known, of around 20 percent. Operating expenses fell 19.6 percent in a quarter-on-quarter basis, analysts in the poll estimated, after bonus and compensation payout fell over 17 percent.  Total revenue was down 3.4 percent to 1.738 billion reais in the quarter, after asset management revenues tumbled 45.1 percent and principal investments - or income from from investing the bank's own money in hedge funds, private-equity investments and real estate - shed 18.8 percent.
