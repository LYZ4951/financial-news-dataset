May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded the F.T.A. Santander Empresas 2's tranche C notes and affirmed the rest, as follows: EUR78.7m Class B (ISIN ES0338058029): affirmed at 'AA+sf''; Outlook Stable EUR62.3m Class C (ISIN ES0338058037): upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook  Stable EUR59.5m Class D (ISIN ES0338058045): affirmed at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable EUR29m Class E (ISIN ES0338058052): affirmed at 'Bsf'; Outlook Negative EUR53.7m Class F (ISIN ES0338058060): affirmed at 'Csf'; RE (Recovery Estimate)  0%  F.T.A. Santander Empresas 2 is a granular cash flow securitisation of a static  portfolio of secured and unsecured loans granted to Spanish small- and  medium-sized enterprises by Banco Santander S.A. <SAN.MC> (BBB+/Negative/F2).   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the class C notes is a result of the transaction's deleveraging  following the payment in full of the senior A-1 and A-2 notes and continued  amortisation of the underlying portfolio, which now stands at 7.9% of its  original balance. Due to the deleveraging, credit enhancement on the class C  note rose to 52.2% from 42.2% over the last 12 months, allowing the notes to now  withstand the agency's 'AAsf' rating stress scenario. The rating on the class B notes is driven by the Country Ceiling of the Kingdom  of Spain, which was upgraded to AA+ from AA on 28 April 2014. Tha affirmation of class D, E and F reflects the transaction's stable underlying  performance. Over the last 12 months 90+ day delinquent loans fell to EUR2.6m  from EUR10.1m while cumulative write-offs rose to EUR14.4m from EUR8.3m, an  indication that the majority of delinquent loans present in the portfolio 12  months ago have migrated into the default bucket. Cumulative failed loans are  currently EUR49m, 1.69% of the initial balance. The transaction is exposed to high obligor concentration risk and may therefore  be subject to increased performance volatility due to risks specific to the  largest obligors. The largest obligor accounts for 8.7% of the portfolio  notional and operates in the utilities industry. This exposure is not secured by  real estate collateral and is due to mature in June 2016. The 10 largest  obligors together represent 41.2% of the portfolio.  The Negative Outlook on the class F notes reflects the vulnerability of the  notes to the transaction's obligor concentration.
