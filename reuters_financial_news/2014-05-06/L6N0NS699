STOCKHOLM/COPENHAGEN, May 6 (Reuters) - Denmark's biggest listed lender Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> denied a Swedish newspaper report on Tuesday it was planning to sell its Swedish and Norwegian operations, saying they were core to the bank's operations.

Swedish business daily Dagens Industri reported late on Tuesday, without citing sources, that the Danish bank has made initial contact with potential buyers, saying many Swedish and Norwegian banks should be interested.  Kenni Leth, a Danske Bank spokesman, said the information reported in the paper was not correct. "Norway and Sweden are a part of our core activities and we see them as strategically important markets which we want to develop and where there are good opportunities to grow organically," he said.
