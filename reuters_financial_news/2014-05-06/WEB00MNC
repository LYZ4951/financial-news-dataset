PARIS, May 6 (Reuters) - French reinsurer Scor <SCOR.PA> posted a 22 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on Tuesday, helped by "solid growth" at its Global Life insurance division.

"Scor is firmly on track to achieve the profitability and solvency targets" set in its "Optimal Dynamics" plan, Chief Executive Denis Kessler said in the statement.
