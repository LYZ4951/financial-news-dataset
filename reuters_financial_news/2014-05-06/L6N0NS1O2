FRANKFURT, May 6 (Reuters) - Hannover Re <HNRGn.DE> repeated its net profit goal of around 850 million euros ($1.2 billion) this year despite reinsurers' weakening pricing power and stiff market competition, its chief financial officer told a German newspaper.

"We are capable of maintaining our profitability," Roland Vogel told financial daily Boersen Zeitung in an interview published on Tuesday. "We can live pretty well with a softening market and competitive pressure," he added.
