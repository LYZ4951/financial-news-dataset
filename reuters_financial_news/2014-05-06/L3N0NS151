SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 0.4 percent in subdued trade on Tuesday, underpinned by gains in banks and consumer stocks, as the central bank gave some positive comments on the economy while holding rates steady.

As expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept interest rates unchanged at record lows for an eighth meeting on Tuesday, just a week before the government is expected to unveil a frugal budget that is likely to be an added drag on the economy over the next few years.
