SAN FRANCISCO, May 6 (Reuters) - Alibaba Holdings Inc <IPO-ALIB.N> will seek to raise $1 billion in what could become the largest technology debut in history, the Chinese e-commerce and payments giant said in its IPO filing on Tuesday.

Alibaba, which powers four-fifths of all online commerce conducted in the world's second-largest economy, becomes the largest Chinese corporation to have sought a home on U.S. bourses.  Its IPO has spurred levels of excitement in Silicon Valley and Wall Street circles unseen since Facebook Inc's <FB.O> record-breaking $16 billion coming-out party in 2012.
