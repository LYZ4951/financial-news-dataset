MILAN, May 6 (Reuters) - Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (BPER) <EMII.MI> became on Tuesday the latest Italian lender planning to tap investors for cash in coming months as it announced a 750 million euro ($1 billion) rights issue to strengthen its capital base.

Italy's sixth-largest bank by branches is among 15 in the country being scrutinised by the European Central Bank this year as part of a check-up of the sector across the euro zone. Nine of the 15 are now planning to raise nearly 11 billion euros in fresh capital. BPER said in a statement it would seek to carry out the share sale by the end of July.
