LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Hedge fund East Lodge, founded by ex-CQS portfolio manager Alistair Lumsden, has opened to external money, a letter to investors seen by Reuters showed.

East Lodge has launched the East Lodge Capital Credit Opportunities Fund and is targeting assets under management of $250 million within three months, a source close to the company added. Lumsden previously managed $3.2 billion for hedge fund CQS, with a focus on asset-backed securities.
