SIENA, Italy, May 6 (Reuters) - A trial for market manipulation and regulatory obstruction against the former managers of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> in the purchase of Antonveneta will be moved to Milan from Siena, a judge in the Siena court ruled on Tuesday.

The decision announced during a public hearing to move the trial follows a request by some members of the defence team.
