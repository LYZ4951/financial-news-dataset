DUBAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Dubai will not have any issues in repaying all its debt maturing in 2015, and more state-linked firms are likely to repay obligations ahead of schedule, a top government official said on Tuesday.

"We will have no issues in repaying debt coming up next year," said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, a close advisor and uncle to Dubai's ruler. Sheikh Ahmed, a key figure in the emirate's recovery from its 2009 debt crisis, was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a Dubai travel industry conference. He heads Dubai's supreme fiscal committee. "We saw some companies paid before time already. I think you might see some more like this in the year to come."
