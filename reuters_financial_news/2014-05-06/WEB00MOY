FRANKFURT, May 6 (Reuters) - German diversified healthcare group Fresenius <FREG.DE> said on Tuesday it was not preparing any major deals to bolster its medical nutrition and generic drugs unit Kabi.

"All M&A projects Kabi is currently working on are small to medium-sized in nature. We are not pursuing any large transactions in the billion-euro-plus category at the present time," Fresenius Chief Executive Ulf Schneider told analysts in a conference call on Tuesday.   Sources told Reuters last month that the field of bidders for Danone's <DANO.PA> Medical Nutrition business, valued at about 4 billion euros ($5.6 billion), narrowed to Fresenius and Swiss food company Nestle <NESN.VX>.
