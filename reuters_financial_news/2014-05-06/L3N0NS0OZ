BEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - A handful of Chinese cities are relaxing property controls to support a cooling house market and shore up the world's second-largest economy, which is growing at its slowest pace in 18 months.

The unwinding of property controls is a turning point in China's housing policy, which has been tightened since 2009 to calm a frothy property market. But after nearly five years of government efforts to restrain house prices by raising downpayment levels and limiting the number of homes that residents can buy, Chinese home prices are still at record highs.  Below are the measures that have been taken to bolster the property market.  * TONGLING CITY, ANHUI PROVINCE, MAY 5 The supply of public housing will be increased, and eligible first-home buyers will receive state subsidies equivalent to 1 percent of the value of their homes. The requirement for getting preferential mortgage rates from the government will be relaxed. Buyers now need to contribute to a social housing fund for just three consecutive months to qualify, down from six months previously. Maximum mortgage sizes will be raised to 300,000 yuan from 250,000 yuan for single-working parent families, and downpayment levels for first-home buyers will be cut to 20 percent, from 30 percent. Existing home owners can also buy a larger property using state loans, and those who want to buy public housing can enjoy a 50 percent discount on their borrowing rates. The city will also make it easier for home buyers to get a hukou -- China's registration system that ties residents to a city and which affects their access to public services such as education and pension plans.  Developers will also have easier access to sales revenues locked up as reserves and managed by the government.

Previously, developers had to pay a downpayment worth 10 percent of the land value.

Previously, buyers had to show that they do not already own a property in their hukou city, or primary place of residence.
