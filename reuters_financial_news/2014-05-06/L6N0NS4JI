LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Spanish testing and inspection services company Applus [IPO-AST.MC] has narrowed the price range for its Madrid stock market listing to 14-15 euros a share, two sources familiar with the deal said on Tuesday.

Last month sources told Reuters that Applus, which is owned by U.S. private equity firm Carlyle <CG.O>, was targeting a price range of 13.25-16.25 euros a share, valuing the firm at up to 2.85 billion euros. [ID:nL6N0NH2QA]
