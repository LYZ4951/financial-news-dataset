COLOMBO, May 6 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares fell on Tuesday, snapping a five-session  winning streak as investors booked profits in large-caps, dealers said.

The day's turnover was high with foreigners buying into risky assets as the lower interest rate regime helped maintain the bullish sentiment.  The main stock index <.CSE> fell 0.37 percent, or 23.30 points, to 6,226.13, slipping from its highest close since Jan. 29 hit in the previous session. The index has gained 1.32 percent in the last five sessions through Monday.  The day's turnover was 1.3 billion rupees ($9.95 million), well above this year's daily average of 968.8 million rupees. Offshore investors were net buyers of 46.7 million rupees worth of stocks on Tuesday, but have been net sellers of 7.21 billion rupees so far this year. Shares in Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC <CTC.CM> fell 1.54 percent to 1,083.00 rupees, while Nestle Lanka PLC <NEST.CM> fell 1.96 percent to 1,941.10 rupees.
