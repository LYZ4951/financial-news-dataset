PARIS, May 6 (Reuters) - European shares rose early on Tuesday, mirroring Wall Street's gains following forecast-beating U.S. macro data, although Barclays <BARC.L> dropped after posting a slide in profit.

Shares in the UK lender were down 2.9 percent after it said adjusted profit before tax fell 5 percent in the first quarter, with revenue in its fixed income business falling more steeply than at most rivals.
