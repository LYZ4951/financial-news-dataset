May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its Global Asset Manager Rating Criteria as part of its periodic criteria review process.  Fitch's Asset Manager Rating methodology is designed to systematically capture,  evaluate and report on the key attributes of an investment manager's operational  and investment platform by focusing on five key areas: 1) Company, 2) Controls,  3) Investments, 4) Operations, and 5) Technology.  Asset Manager Ratings are assigned on a five-point descriptive scale ranging  from 'Highest Standards' to 'Inadequate'. The top three ratings -  'Highest  Standard',  'High Standards', and  'Good Standards' - are expected to apply to  those asset managers that meet or exceed the standards typically applied by  institutional investors. The updated report does not include any material changes to the agency's ratings  approach and as a result, there is no impact on existing ratings.
