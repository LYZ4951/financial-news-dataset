PRAGUE, May 6 (Reuters) - Czech lender Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR> will likely post flat net profit in the first quarter as a pickup in risk costs counters cost savings, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

The average estimate of 10 analysts in the poll saw net profit at 3.14 billion crowns ($158.84 million), versus 3.15 billion in the same period last year. Analysts also expect revenue was flat in the quarter while risk costs likely ticked up, in line with the company's 2014 outlook. Komercni Banka, 60.4 percent owned by France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, forecasts rising provisions against risky assets to weigh on profitability this year even as lending growth accelerates later in the year when the Czech economy is expected to get on stronger footing.
