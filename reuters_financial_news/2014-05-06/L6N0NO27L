May 6 (Reuters) - Greece's successful return to bond markets last month has helped to spur interest from international investors in the country's plans to sell off state assets - including airports, ports and railways - to cut debts. [ID:L6N0NM354]

Below are privatisation proceeds Greece has raised so far, its future targets and an indicative time-table of upcoming asset sales and concessions. The figures have been compiled by Reuters, based on official documents.
