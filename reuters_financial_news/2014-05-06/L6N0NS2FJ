FRANKFURT, May 6 (Reuters) - Axel Springer <SPRGn.DE> is very unlikely to reduce its stake in its digital classified ads joint venture with private equity firm General Atlantic.

Chief Executive Mathias Doepfner said that the deal, which was sealed in 2012, can be amended as of 2015 and could include a listing or sale of parts of the company but added no decision has been taken.
