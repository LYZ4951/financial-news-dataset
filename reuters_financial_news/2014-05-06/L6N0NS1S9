KUWAIT, May 6 (Reuters) - Kuwait's financial regulator has given Bahrain-based investment firm Gulf Finance House <GFHB.BH> <GFHK.KW> until Sunday to hold its annual general meeting (AGM) and approve 2013 results or face a suspension of its Kuwait-listed shares.

The watchdog, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), has been tightening oversight on corporate disclosure as it attempts to  promote investor confidence in the Gulf state's financial sector. A Reuters survey of a dozen international fund managers this year found they ranked Kuwait lowest among five big Middle Eastern markets for corporate disclosure. [ID:nL5N0LH2BQ] The CMA has asked the stock market to suspend Gulf Finance House's (GFH) shares if it fails to meet the deadline, a Monday filing on Kuwait's stock exchange showed. GFH said in a statement on the Bahraini bourse, where it is dual-listed, that it had filed a petition against the CMA decision, without giving further details. The company reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results on Feb. 23. It said it made a net profit of $5.2 million in the three months to Dec. 31, up from $2.5 million in the prior-year period. For 2013, its net profit fell 37.2 percent to $6.3 million. Under Kuwaiti regulations, companies must approve their annual results at an AGM within 45 days of reporting them.  Last month GFH, through its Dubai-based subsidiary GFH Capital, sold its majority stake in English soccer club Leeds United - which it bought in December 2012 - to Italian Massimo Cellino.
