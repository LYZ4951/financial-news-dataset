WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee will vote on a bill to revamp the U.S. housing finance system next week, a Senate aide said on Tuesday.

Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a Democrat, and Senator Mike Crapo, the panel's top Republican, had previously delayed scheduling votes on the bill in order to build more support for the plan that would wind down taxpayer-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB>.
