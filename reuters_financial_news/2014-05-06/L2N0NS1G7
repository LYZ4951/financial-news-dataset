WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - A Senate panel will hold a hearing next week on high-frequency trading and other forms of automated trading in futures markets to see how regulators can keep derivatives markets safe, a spokesman said on Tuesday.

Computer-driven trading became a hot topic again after the launch of the book "Flash Boys" by best-selling author Michael Lewis, who argues that equity markets are rigged in favor of high-frequency traders. Futures markets, regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are also a common hunting ground for speed traders, and the agency is probing them to see if they are breaching the CFTC's rules.

The panel has just approved Timothy Massad - a former senior Treasury official - as the CFTC's new chairman, as well as two other new members of the five-strong commission. The full Senate has yet to approve the three nominees.
