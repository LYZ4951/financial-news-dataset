May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned State Grid Overseas  Investment (2014) Limited's USD1,250m 2.750% guaranteed senior notes due 2019,  USD1,600m 4.125% guaranteed senior notes due 2024 and USD650m 4.850% guaranteed  senior notes due 2044 final ratings of 'A+'.  The notes are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by State Grid  Corporation of China [STGRD.UL] (SGCC, A+/Stable). The notes are rated at the same level as  SGCC's senior unsecured rating as they represent unconditional, unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations of the company.  The final rating assignment follows a review of final documentation materially  conforming to the draft documentation previously reviewed. The final ratings are  same as the expected ratings assigned on 15 April 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Equalised With the Sovereign: The ratings of SGCC are equalised with the China  sovereign (A+/Stable), the company's ultimate owner, as per Fitch's  Parent-Subsidiary Linkage methodology. The equalisation of SGCC's ratings with  the state takes into consideration its strategic importance to China as well as  strong financial and operational support extended to SGCC by the government via  both monetary and regulatory policy support.  Strategic Role in China: SGCC's monopoly concessions serve over 1.1 billion  users in 26 provinces, or 88% of the national territory, representing  approximately 80% of the nation's total electricity consumption. As the largest  purchaser, distributor and retailer of electricity, SGCC also holds a critical  role in the electricity value chain in China.  Evolving Regulatory Environment: Fitch considers the regulatory framework to be  highly beneficial to SGCC overall. Fitch expects the state to maintain tight  control on electricity transmission and distribution tariffs, preserving SGCC's  strong financial and strategic position. The regulatory framework could evolve  over the next decade, leading to a liberalisation of the retail segment that  could be preceded by a clearer transmission and distribution tariff framework. Support from Government: SGCC has been receiving monetary and tax treatment  support from the state. Most importantly, the state ensures SGCC a reasonable  return on invested assets. During the next several years, the country will rely  on SGCC to develop the power grid to keep pace with economic growth, facilitate  changes to the coal-fired generation capacity and develop renewable energy  sources. The current tariff framework and support from the government will  continue to allow SGCC to maintain a robust financial profile.  Strong Standalone Profile: SGCC's financial profile is robust for its 'A+'  rating. Fitch expects SGCC's cash flow generation to remain strong, funds flow  from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to remain below 2.75x and the FFO  interest cover to be around 8.5x on a sustained basis (2.0x and 8.5x  respectively in 2013). The company also maintains healthy liquidity and a  favourable debt profile.   Strong Liquidity: SGCC's liquidity position stems from its robust internal cash  generation, its well-structured debt maturities, as well as its access to debt  markets. SGCC has committed credit facilities from major banks of over CNY1trn.  There is little secured debt (less than 5% of total consolidated debt). SGCC  also centrally manages the cash flow generated by its subsidiaries.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, result in  negative rating action: -A negative rating action on the sovereign  -Weakening linkages with the sovereign in conjunction with deterioration in FFO  adjusted net leverage to over 3.0x and FFO interest cover to less than 5.0x on a  sustained basis   Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, result in  positive rating action:
