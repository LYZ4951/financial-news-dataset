May 6 (Reuters) - Several multi-billion dollar deals and offers announced over the past few weeks have made 2014 the busiest year for healthcare acquisitions, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Bayer's $14.2 billion acquisition of Merck's consumer care business on Tuesday pushed the value of pharmaceutical M&As to $239.1 billion so far this year. Healthcare companies, under pressure from tougher reimbursement regulations in developed countries, are adding scale, picking up specialized expertise and shedding non-core businesses.
