May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fracking could potentially harm local water supplies,  causing significant financial stress for U.S. municipal water utilities,  according to a new Fitch Ratings report. Potential contamination, diminished  water supplies and infrastructure and costs pressure due to fracking could, in  the worst case scenarios, cause severe and precipitous credit deterioration. 'Contamination could be a major setback for local utilities as water sales would  cease immediately,' said Douglas Scott, Managing Director. 'While the cost of  clean-up is significant in itself, restoring public confidence in the water  supplies may take much longer.' 'Fracking can be an economic boom for some communities, but its introduction or  expansion in unprepared areas could create competition for already-scarce water  resources in the case of drought, or place undue stress on the existing water  infrastructure in areas that experience rapid population growth.' Despite some state regulations requiring oil and gas companies to disclose the  chemicals used during fracking, these regulations are subject to the federal  disclosure laws, which exempt disclosure of certain chemical composition that  may be deemed trade secrets. Even if specific chemicals are disclosed, they may  not be on the list of regulated contaminants and, as a result, may go undetected  during testing and treatment.  Crude oil production in the U.S. increased 32% between 2011-2013. Approximately  90% of total oil production in the lower 48 states is produced in six shale  plays spanning 15 states and 271 counties, via both fracking and conventional  well technology. Utilities located in those areas face higher risk for  contamination than others, and that risk is likely growing as the use of  fracking technology is becoming more prevalent.  With 56% of hydraulically fractured wells located in regions experiencing  drought, fracking could leave utilities competing for water supplies. The amount  of water used for fracking could be significant in communities already dealing  with water scarcity, like those located near the Eagle Ford shale play in south  Texas.
