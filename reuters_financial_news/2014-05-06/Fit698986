May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that UK-based primary care dental services provider Integrated Dental Holdings' (IDH) acquisition of The Dental Directory (DD) has no impact on  IDH's credit profile. Fitch rates IDH's parent, Turnstone Midco 2 Ltd, Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'B+' with a Stable Outlook. In addition, we believe that IDH's announced bond tap issue of GBP100m to  refinance amounts drawn under its revolving credit facility (RCF) will not  affect the 'BB-'/'RR3' ratings on IDH Finance plc's outstanding GBP200m (GBP300m  pro forma for the tap issue) senior secured floating rate notes. This is because  the increased senior debt is matched by a growing revenue-generating asset base  resulting from on-going bolt-on M&A and therefore does not change our opinion  regarding above-average recovery prospects for senior secured creditors, nor the  already low recoveries for IDH's GBP75m second lien notes, which are rated  'B-'/'RR6'. The acquisition of DD, a leading multi-channel distributor of dental supplies  and consumables to the dental sector, will further cement IDH's vertical  integration in the dental clinics value chain. Despite a mild erosion expected  in EBITDA margin in FY15 (ending March 2015), Fitch assumes some cost savings in  procurement over the medium term and some diversification to the business  profile of the group. This is mitigated by slightly slower deleveraging than  previously assumed. DD's enterprise value is mainly debt-funded by drawings on the RCF. Once the  drawn RCF is refinanced via the planned issue of additional notes, the RCF is  expected to be drawn again over the next few years to support continuing bolt-on  acquisitions of dental clinics in the UK, in line with the management strategy  of increasing scale in a fragmented market. Adjusting for contribution of such  acquisitions, Fitch forecasts slight deterioration in funds from operations  (FFO) adjusted net leverage to over 6.0x for FY15. However, over the longer-term  positive free cash flow (FCF) along with the increasing scale of the business  and profitability should support deleveraging, sending FFO adjusted net leverage  lower to 5.0x-5.5x range by March 2018. We continue to assume that IDH's acquisition strategy will be aimed at taking  advantage of the fragmented dentistry market in the UK. The acquisition of small  practices with 'evergreen contracts' with the NHS is a sensible strategy as it  complements the group's operations and thus does not bear major integration  costs. However, failure to integrate the latest and future acquisitions, leading  to either the revenue contribution of new practices being below historical  levels, or an erosion of group profitability due to cost overruns could put  pressure on the already stretched credit metrics.
