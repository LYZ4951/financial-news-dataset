LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - European stocks were flat on Tuesday as upbeat outlook statements from chemical groups Solvay and DSM were offset by sharp falls in Barclays <BARC.L> and Aberdeen Asset Management <ADN.L> after weak results.

Shares in Solvay <SOLB.BR> and DSM <DSMN.AS> both rose around 3 percent to be among top FTSEurofirst 300 risers as the former said it expects high single-digit percentage growth in core profit this year and the latter forecast higher earnings in the remainder of 2014. [ID:nL6N0NS165] [ID:nL3N0NS14M] They helped brighten the mood in a mixed earnings season so far in Europe, where 45 percent of STOXX Europe 600 <.STOXX> companies missed consensus estimates and earnings forecasts for next 12 months have been cut by 0.9 percent over the past 30 days, StarMine data showed.  At 1004 GMT the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was flat at 1,348.02, hovering close to a near six-year high hit on Friday. The Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> was also flat at 3,170.33 points.  "It's good that the markets have stayed where they were despite this earnings correction," François Duhen, director of dedicated research at CM-CIC Securities in Paris, said. "Now that is done, earnings expectations are more sustainable."Shares in Barclays and Aberdeen fell 4.4 percent and 5.9 percent respectively after they reported a drop in first quarter profit. Barclays was hit by weak fixed income revenue and Aberdeen by volatility in emerging markets. [ID:nL6N0NS1GI] [ID:nL6N0NS1JJ] The picture was brighter in the Iberian peninsula, where Spain's IBEX <.IBEX> and Portugal PSI <.PSI20> each rose 0.5 percent after stronger-than-expected results by Spanish infrastructure firm Abertis <ABE.MC> and Millennium bcp <BCP.LS>, Portugal's largest listed bank by assets. [ID:nS8N0MM015] [ID:nL6N0NR3HS]   M&A BOOST Mergers & acquisitions activity once again helped buoy shares as traders speculated Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia <NOK1V.HE> could make a move for rival Alcatel-Lucent <ALUA.PA>, sending shares in the French firm up 4 percent. [ID:nWEB00MNY]  German auto parts and tyre maker Continental <CONG.DE> rose 3.2 percent as its finance chief Wolfgang Schaefer said the company aims to grow by buying firms and would be able to shoulder another multi-billion euro acquisition in the next 18 months. [ID:nF9N0IX02F] Increased M&A activity has been a key source of support for European equities in the past month, helping offset concerns over tensions between Russia and western powers over Ukraine. "Corporates turning expansionary is a major support," strategists at JP Morgan wrote in a note, recommending that investors remain buyers of European stocks. "This is the next big catalyst that we were looking for to help stocks."
