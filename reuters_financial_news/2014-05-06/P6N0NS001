PARIS, May 6 (Reuters) - French bank Natixis <CNAT.PA> reported a 3 percent rise in underlying net income for the first quarter on Tuesday and said it was on track to meet its 2014-2017 dividend payout targets.

Investment-bank-focused Natixis said quarterly net income rose 3 percent to 303 million euros ($420.52 million) - excluding own-debt charges and one-off items - after a rebound in equities and a strong rise in asset management and insurance sales helped offset a grim environment for bonds.
