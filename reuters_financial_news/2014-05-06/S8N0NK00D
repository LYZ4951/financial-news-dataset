SAO PAULO, May 6 (Reuters) - Grupo BTG Pactual SA <BBTG11.SA>, Latin America's largest independent investment bank, beat first-quarter profit estimates on Tuesday after management slashed banker bonuses by 28 percent in a quarter-on-quarter basis as revenue slipped.

Net income at the São Paulo-based lender, controlled by billionaire financier André Esteves, came in at 832 million reais ($373 million) in the quarter, well above the 797 million reais estimate in a Reuters poll of three analysts.  Annualized return on equity was 20.2 percent in the first quarter, compared with the 19.4 percent estimate in the poll.
