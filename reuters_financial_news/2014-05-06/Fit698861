May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Singapore-based EQ Insurance Co Ltd's (EQI) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating at 'BBB+'. The Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect EQI's strong capitalisation that is commensurate with its  business portfolio, generally prudent underwriting approach, and liquid  investment mix. The rating also recognises the continuing challenges that EQI  faces in building its franchise, and gaining market recognition amid competitive  pressures in Singapore.  EQI sources almost 100% of its business from the Singaporean market, which is  largely free from natural catastrophes. Gross premiums rose by 6.7% in 2013 but  higher claim experiences led to an overall decline in EQI's profitability. Net  income fell to SGD0.3m in 2013, from SGD4.4m the previous year. Since then, the  company has tightened its underwriting discipline and Fitch expects its  operating performance will improve. Its combined ratio at end-March 2014 stood  at 96%, an improvement from 106% at end-2013. Management forecast that the  combined ratio would fall below 95% for 2014. The company continues to maintain strong capital buffers that are commensurate  with its business profile. Its paid-up capital grew steadily from SGD20.0m in  2009 to SGD36.5m in 2013 due to various capital injections from shareholders to  support its business growth. EQI's regulatory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio was  194% in 2013, remaining above the statutory requirement of 120%. Capital quality  is sound, comprising entirely equity capital and retained earnings, with no  financial leverage. EQI's investment mix remained prudent, with cash/fixed deposits and fixed income  securities accounting for more than 80% of the total invested assets at  end-2013. Its stocks-to-shareholders' funds ratio is low at 24% in 2013 and  consists of good credit quality investments with sustained dividend yield. The  company also has a good liquidity position to meet its insurance liabilities as  the ratio of liquid assets to the company's net technical reserves was 174% at  end-2013.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
