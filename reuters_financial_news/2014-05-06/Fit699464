May 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited's <BEN.AX> (BEN, A-/Stable) ratings are unaffected by the acquisition of Rural Finance  Corporation Victoria (Rural Finance), as the bank's capital and liquidity  positions are unlikely to materially weaken as a result of the deal. At the same  time, BEN's franchise in the Victorian agriculture market will improve through  the acquisition. The AUD1.8bn transaction was announced on 5 May 2014 and is  subject to regulatory approval. The purchase price is to be funded through a fully underwritten AUD230m  institutional share placement, an additional share purchase plan of up to AUD50m  which is not underwritten, wholesale funding, retail deposits and surplus  liquidity. Capital and liquidity positions are expected to remain robust post  acquisition, supporting BEN's ratings. Any significant weakening in BEN's  funding and liquidity positions could lead to a negative rating action as  indicated in Fitch's rating commentary dated 28 November 2013. The acquired business and loan book will provide the bank with a larger  footprint in the Victorian agriculture market while also diversifying the bank's  agriculture exposure. The acquired loan book accounts for less than 3% of BEN's  total assets as at 31 December 2013 but will allow the bank to fast-track its  strategic franchise improvement plans. The acquired business is high-margin,  with a proven strong track record in asset quality.
