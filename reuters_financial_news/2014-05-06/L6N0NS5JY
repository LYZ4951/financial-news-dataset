OKLAHOMA CITY, May 6 (Reuters) - A central Oklahoma wildfire that has killed one person, destroyed about 30 structures and caused more than 1,000 people to flee to safer ground has been largely contained, fire officials said on Tuesday.

But the state is still worried that dry conditions, high heat and low humidity could cause fires to break out in other parts of the state. The fire, which started on Sunday, burned about 3,500 acres (1,415 hectares) near Guthrie, west of Tulsa, and has been about 75 percent contained, fire officials said.
