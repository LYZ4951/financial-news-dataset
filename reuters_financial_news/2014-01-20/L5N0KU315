FRANKFURT, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> on Monday urged policymakers to work together to make Frankfurt a European centre for financial market activities in China.

Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni said the activities of the Frankfurt exchange operator and the European Central Bank, as well as strong trade relations between Germany and China, created favourable conditions for Frankfurt's role. "This will only succeed, however, if the important institutions, policymakers and the financial centre here all pull together as a team," Francioni said in the text of a speech at the bourse's new year reception event. "This will also largely determine our work in 2014 and beyond," Francioni said.
