WARSAW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Rating agency Standard and Poor's assigned a "A-" rating to a eurobond of Poland's largest bank PKO BP <PKO.BP>, the bank said in a statement.

PKO placed five-year bonds worth 500 million euros last week, with a spread of 115 basis points above mid-swaps and said it may issue more bonds in the future.
