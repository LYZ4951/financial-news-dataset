HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares were knocked off a two-week high on Monday after data showed an easing in China's pace of economic expansion in the last quarter due to sagging investment growth.

Chinese growth-sensitive sectors were the leading drags on the index, and a weak mainland market was another factor.  The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> closed below the 2,000-point mark for the first time in 5-1/2 months as soaring short-term funding costs deepened uneasiness that new A-share listings will inject more competition for already limited cash. [ID:nH9N0K200I] The Hang Seng Index <.HSI>, which closed on Friday at its highest since Jan. 2, ended down 0.9 percent at 22,929 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong sank 1.3 percent. [ID:nL3N0KU10S] Losses came in weak turnover as an initial lift from China's macroeconomic data that came in a fraction better than expectation faded in afternoon trade.  Fourth-quarter GDP growth came in at 7.7 percent, compared with 7.6 percent forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll but easing from 7.8 percent in the previous three months. [ID:nL3N0KU0W8]
