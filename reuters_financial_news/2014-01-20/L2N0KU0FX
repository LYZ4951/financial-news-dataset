SAO PAULO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Trading volumes in the cash equities segment at BM&FBovespa SA, Brazil's sole financial exchange, are likely to suffer this year from the impact of a presidential election and holidays in coming months that may keep foreign investors on the sidelines, Chief Executive Edemir Pinto said in an interview.

Turnover velocity, or the intensity at which stocks change hands, may remain weak this year as trading reels from Brazil's hosting of the soccer World Cup and holidays, Pinto said. Higher interest rates and mounting risk aversion towards Brazil could also play a part by discouraging inflows, he added.
