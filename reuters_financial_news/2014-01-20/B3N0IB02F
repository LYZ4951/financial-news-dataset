BUDAPEST, Jan 20 (Reuters) - There is no threat of deflation in the Hungarian economy despite price growth running near historic lows, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday.

"Hungary is a country where inflation has to be looked for under a microscope, without, however, there being any deflationary threat in the economy," Orban told a conference.
