KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Malaysian state investor Khazanah Nasional Bhd [KHAZA.UL] said on Monday the value of its portfolio rose to 134.9 billion ringgit ($40.7 billion) last year from 121.5 billion ringgit in 2012.

The sovereign wealth fund, whose investments are overwhelmingly domestic, has been steadily increasing activity abroad as it looks to diversify its risks. This year, it bid for a Thai bank and a Turkish insurer, winning the latter.
