FRANKFURT, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rate held steady on Monday as banks slowly reduce their reliance on the European Central Bank for funding and turn to the market again in a sign of growing confidence.

The ECB is following the latest developments in money markets closely, having pledged to intervene should the rise in bank-to-bank lending rates that underpin borrowing costs across the economy become "unwarranted". [ID:nL5N0KR0ZV] A gradual rise in the rates is seen to reflect banks beginning to wean off central bank funding and tapping markets again, a kind of normalisation, but if the increase accelerates it could threaten the euro zone's recovery. One of the drivers pushing inter-bank rates higher is falling excess liquidity - money banks have beyond what they need for their day-to-day operations. On Monday, excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> stood at 135 billion euros, slightly higher than Friday's 131 billion euros, which was the lowest since September 2011, before the ECB launched the long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) and pumped more than 1 trillion euros into the system to ease banks' funding strains. It peaked in mid-2012 at just above 800 billion. On Monday, the three-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR3MD=>, traditionally the main gauge of unsecured bank-to-bank lending, stayed at 0.302 percent, the highest since August 2012. The six-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR6MD=> held at 0.408 percent and the shorter-term one-week rate <EURIBORSWD=> fell to 0.221 percent from 0.227 percent. Overnight Eonia <EONIA=> jumped to 0.343 percent on Friday from 0.300 percent the previous day.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a package of graphics on the ECB, click on:  http://link.reuters.com/neg32sFor graphic of euro zone liquidity levels click:http://link.reuters.com/qeq25s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Euribor rates are fixed daily by the Banking Federation of  the European Union (FBE) shortly after 1000 GMT. * For a table of the latest Euribor fixings for terms of one week to one year, double click on <EURIBOR=> * For a table of the previous day's fixings of EONIA swap  rates, which show market expectations for future overnight  lending rates, double click on <EONIAINDEX> * For graphs of historic Euribor and EONIA swap rates, right click on the links in angle brackets below, and select 'Related Graph'   1 week<EURIBORSWD=><EONIAINDEXSW=> 2 week<EURIBOR2WD=><EONIAINDEX2W=> 1 month   <EURIBOR1MD=><EONIAINDEX1M=> 2 month   <EURIBOR2MD=><EONIAINDEX2M=> 3 month   <EURIBOR3MD=><EONIAINDEX3M=> 6 month   <EURIBOR6MD=><EONIAINDEX6M=> 9 month   <EURIBOR9MD=><EONIAINDEX9M=>
