FRANKFURT, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DEe> expects to see further legal and regulatory "headwind" in the coming quarters, its Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause said in a conference call on Monday.

Germany's biggest lender earlier said its litigation reserves fell to 2.3 billion euros ($3.12 billion) in the fourth quarter from 4.1 billion in the third, as it settled some cases with regulators. [ID:nL5N0KT0UJ]
