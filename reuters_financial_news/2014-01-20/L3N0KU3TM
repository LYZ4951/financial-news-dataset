SYDNEY, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to fall at the open on Tuesday as a dip in copper and Shanghai steel futures may weigh on resource stocks, while a lack of leads may leave trade thin the session after Wall Street was closed for a public holiday.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.1 percent, a 46-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark slipped 0.2 percent on Monday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was flat in early trade. * Wall Street was closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. * Copper dipped in holiday-thinned trade as near-term demand prospects from top consumer China remained muted, despite slightly better-than-expected Chinese growth data. * Gold steadied after touching its highest level in nearly six weeks with a lower dollar and a dip in equities boosting investor confidence in the yellow metal.  * Shanghai steel futures fell for a third straight session to trade near record lows.----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2224 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1838.7  -0.39%-7.190 USD/JPY <JPY=>   104.15  -0.01%-0.010 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.8194  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1253.19  0.00% 0.000 US CRUDE<CLc1>   93.72   -0.69%-0.650 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16458.56 0.25% 41.55 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  146.68  -0.21% -0.30 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St was closed for the Martin Luther King holiday   [.N]   * Oil dips below $106/bbl on China data, Iran deal   [O/R]   * Gold steadies near 6-week high, strike notice lifts platinum[GOL/]   * Copper edges lower on muted China demand prospects   [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB] DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
