WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it was hopeful after the UN withdrew an invitation for Iran to attend Syria talks that all parties could refocus their efforts to end the Syrian civil war.

The UN said late on Monday it had withdrawn an offer to Iran to attend the talks in Switzerland on Jan. 22 after Tehran failed to support a 2012 plan for a political transition in Syria. "We are hopeful that, in the wake of today's announcement, all parties can now return to focus on the task at hand, which is bringing an end to the suffering of the Syrian people and beginning a process toward a long overdue political transition," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.
