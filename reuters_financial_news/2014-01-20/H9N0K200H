HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Shanghai Composite Index dipped below the key 2,000-point level early on Monday to its lowest in 5-1/2 months, led by financials but unmoved by data that showed China's annual growth came in slightly higher than expected.

At 0226 GMT, the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was down 0.4 percent at 1,996.2 points, its lowest since July 31. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares listings was down 0.3 percent.
