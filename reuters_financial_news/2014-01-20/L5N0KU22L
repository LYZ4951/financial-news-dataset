DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia real estate firm Dar Al Arkan <4300.SE> posted an 8.9 percent increase in fourth-quarter net profit on Monday, missing analyst forecasts despite higher margins on property sales and lower costs.

The company made a profit of 156.8 million riyals ($41.81 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, up from 144 million riyals in the prior-year period, according to a bourse filing. Analysts polled by Reuters on average forecast Dar Al Arkan would make a quarterly profit of 250.4 million riyals. [ID:nL5N0KT051] Dar Al Arkan 2013's net profit was 681.5 million riyals. This compares with a profit of 988.5 million riyals in 2012.  The firm blamed the drop in annual profit on lower property sales and a decline in non-operating income.  ($1 = 3.7505 Saudi riyals)
