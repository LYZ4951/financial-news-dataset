BERLIN, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The value of online exports in six of the top e-commerce markets will grow fivefold to $130 billion by 2020, with Britain currently generating the biggest online trade surplus by selling more goods abroad, research showed on Monday.

The study by London-based management consultancy OC&C and U.S. search engine Google <GOOG.O> estimated the value of cross-border online trade in the United States, Britain, Germany, the Nordics, the Netherlands and France at $25 billion for 2013. E-commerce is expanding at breakneck pace, with online retail sales in Europe seen doubling by 2018 to 323 billion euros ($437.91 billion), market research firm Mintel forecasts. [ID:nL6N0GG283] "Over the next decade, online retail will become even more international. This represents a great opportunity for retailers by providing a new, capital-light approach to grow rapidly,"  OC&C partner Anita Balchandani said in a statement. Britain, the most advanced e-commerce market in the world, generated the biggest online trade surplus in 2013 of more than $1 billion, OC&C estimated, followed by the United States with a surplus of $180 million and Germany on $35 million. While OC&C said U.S. online pioneers eBay <EBAY.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> were the top international players in pure e-commerce, German online fashion retailer Zalando and British rival ASOS <ASOS.L> were next in their ranking. ASOS said on Jan. 14 that retail sales rose 38 percent to 335.7 million pounds in the four months to Dec. 31, helped by a jump of 69 percent in Europe even as growth in the United States and Australia slowed. [ID:nL6N0KO0IO] Swedish furniture retailer IKEA [IKEA.UL] topped the OC&C ranking of traditional players using e-commerce to speed their international expansion, followed by fashion retailer H&M <HMb.ST> and U.S. cosmetics seller Avon Products Inc <AVP.N>.
