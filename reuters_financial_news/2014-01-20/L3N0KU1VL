SHANGHAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - China's money rates rose on Monday following a similar rise on Friday, with traders primarily blaming the resumption of initial public offerings (IPOs) in January as the immediate factor taking cash out of circulation.

Eight Chinese companies said on Monday that they would list on China's smaller Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Tuesday, the first listings on the bourse since a 14-month regulatory freeze on IPOs to support the stock market. The listings followed last Friday's trading debut of Neway Valve (Suzhou) Co Ltd <603699.SS> on China's main Shanghai Stock Exchange, which jumped 43.5 percent on the first trading day, just shy of its daily limit, underscoring pent-up demand that bodes well for a raft of new issues to come.

The average one-day "overnight" repo <CN1DRP=CFXS> also rose sharply to 4.0680 percent from 2.9850 percent. The phenomenon comes as little surprise to money dealers, who had long predicted that the confluence of factors would conspire to produce another cash crunch by the end of January, following quickly on the heels of another one in December.
