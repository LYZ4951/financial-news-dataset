DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - National Bank of Oman <NBO.OM> (NBO), the sultanate's second-largest lender by assets, posted a flat fourth-quarter net profit, missing analysts' expectations.

The lender made a net profit of 10.2 million rials ($26.5 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, Reuters calculated, the same as the corresponding period of 2012. Four analysts polled by Reuters on average forecast NBO's fourth-quarter profit would be 11.57 million rials. [ID:nL6N0KG05U] Reuters calculated the net profit figure based on the bank's previous financial results. It posted a net profit of 41.4 million rials for 2013, up from 40.7 million rials in the previous year, a statement to the Muscat bourse said on Monday. Loans and advances stood at 2.07 billion rials at the end of December, 8 percent higher than the 1.91 billion rials at the same point of 2012.
