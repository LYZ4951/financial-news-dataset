BUCHAREST, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Romanian unit of Raiffeisen Bank plans to issue 500 million lei ($149.55 million) worth of five-year bonds in the second quarter, a bank official was quoted as saying by daily Ziarul Financiar.    The bank sold 225 million lei worth of three-year bonds with a coupon of 5.5 percent in July 2013.[ID:nL6N0FV177]    Earlier this month Romania's central bank surprised markets by lowering lenders' minimum reserve requirements for liabilities in both leu and foreign currencies, which will free up a lot of funds on the market. [ID:nL6N0KI10O]    "It is true we will have additional liquidity ... but we want to keep issuing and the five-year maturity is important," said James Stewart, a bank executive.
