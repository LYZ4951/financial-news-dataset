WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand's consumers price index (CPI) rose 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, as higher housing costs offset cheaper fresh food, and fuel prices, according to data released by Statistics New Zealand on Tuesday.

The annual rise was 1.6 percent, the biggest since the March 2012 quarter. A Reuters poll of economists forecast a quarterly decline of 0.1 percent and an annual rate of 1.5 percent, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) forecast a 0.2 percent quarterly fall. The main groups to rise were international air fares, which normally increase at the end of the year, and housing and household utilities, which include the costs of running, renting, and buying new houses. The main items to fall were seasonally cheaper vegetable prices, and petrol. Overall seven of the 11 groups had price rises, which also included clothing, and recreational services. That was partly offset by lower prices for telecommunications. The non-tradables group, a barometer of domestic inflation, rose 0.5 percent on the previous quarter for an annual rise of 2.9 percent, the biggest annual rise since September 2011.All figures are percentage change. ----------------------------------------------------------  Qtr-on-qtr, CPI all groupsQ4 2013Pvs qtr  Year ago  +0.1   +0.9  -0.2   Versus year ago+1.6   +1.4  +0.9 ---------------------------------------------------------- Qtr-on-qtr, tradables Q4 2013Pvs qtr  Year ago  -0.5   +1.2  -0.7   Versus year ago-0.3   -0.5  -1.0 ----------------------------------------------------------   Qtr-on-qtr, non-tradablesQ4 2013Pvs qtr  Year ago  +0.5   +0.7  +0.3   Versus year ago+2.9   +2.8  +2.5 ----------------------------------------------------------   Weighted median, qtr-on-qtrQ4 2013Pvs qtr  Year ago +0.3   +0.5  +0.2   Versus year ago +2.0   +1.8  +1.6 ----------------------------------------------------------   The first quarter consumer price index will be released on   April 16.
