FRANKFURT, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> shares were poised to fall 4.7 percent in opening trading on Monday after the bank posted a surprise pre-tax loss of 1.15 billion euros for the fourth quarter.

Germany's biggest lender released its quarterly figures ahead of schedule, saying heavy costs for litigation and restructuring had hit performance and warning that 2014 would be another year of further challenges and reform. [ID:nL5N0KT0UJ]
