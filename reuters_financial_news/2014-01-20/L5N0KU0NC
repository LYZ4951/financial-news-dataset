VIENNA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Austrian regional banks that own most of part-nationalised Volksbanken AG <OTVVp.VI> have increased their stake to 51.6 percent by buying a 1.5 percent stake from German insurer Ergo [VICGn.UL], the bank said on Monday.

It was confirming a report by the newspaper WirtschaftsBlatt, which also cited supervisory board sources as saying the lender might need up to 200 million euros ($271 million) in additional state aid this year.  A bank spokesman would not confirm this, saying any support that the loss-making lender may require would be clear only after it has finalised its 2013 results. Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger had told a Sunday newspaper that Austria would not exceed the 5.8 billion euro aid limit it has set for ailing banks by 2018. [ID:nL5N0KT0A0]
