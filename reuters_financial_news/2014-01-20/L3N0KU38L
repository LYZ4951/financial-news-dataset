Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital has hired Ganen Sarvananthan, head of investments at Malaysian state investor Khazanah Nasional Berhad, as a partner and managing director in its Asia business.

Sarvananthan, who has been with Khazanah for nine years,  will join TPG on April 30, the Malaysian state fund said in a statement on Monday.  He will head Southeast Asia for TPG, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The move follows a leadership shuffle at TPG Capital late last year when it made senior partner Tim Dattels co-head of Asia, alongside Ben Gray, a former Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> banker. [ID:nL4N0IY0XJ]  Southeast Asia has been a hot spot for private equity firms, where competition for deals and dealmakers is heating up.
