MEXICO CITY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks fell nearly 1 percent on Monday, hurt by economic data from China suggesting an impending slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy.

On a day of light trading due to the Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday in the United States, Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> rose slightly, while Chile's bourse <.IPSA> ended a three-day rally. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> closed the day down 0.96 percent. Chinese data released on Monday showed growth in investment and factory output flagged in the final months of last year. Some economists now say a cooldown will be inevitable this year. [ID:nL3N0KU1Y4] China is a major customer of Brazil, buying up massive volumes of its commodities, and any wobbles in the Asian giant's economy reverberate in Brazilian markets.  Preferred shares of mining firm Vale SA <VALE5.SA>, which sells most of the iron ore it mines to China, slipped 2.83 percent. Shares in state oil giant Petrobras <PETR4.SA> fell 2.13 percent.  * Shares of Brazilian homebuilder Gafisa <GFSA3.SA> advanced 0.86 percent after the company reported a better-than-expected increase in fourth-quarter project launches and sales late Friday. * In Mexico, where the IPC index <.MXX> added 0.16 percent, shares of lender Grupo Financiero Banorte <GFNORTEO.MX> rose 0.92 percent, driving gains.
