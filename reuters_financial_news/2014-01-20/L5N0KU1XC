BELGRADE, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Serbia borrowed 150 million euros ($203.36 million) from the European Investment Bank on Monday to encourage small and medium enterprises as the Balkan country sets out on membership talks with the European Union.

The loan is a part of a wider 500 million-euro credit line aimed at sustaining Serbia's economic recovery and helping it along the road to EU accession, the EIB said in a statement. "The loan will be channeled through local financial institutions, with the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) acting as the Agent to the loan facility," it said.   It is the fifth such loan from the EIB to Serbia since the 2000 overthrow of late strongman Slobodan Milosevic. The last, totalling 250 million euros, ran between 2011 and 2013. Serbia formally begins EU membership talks on Tuesday, a process the country hopes will drive reform and lure foreign investors. It is not expected to join the bloc before 2020.
