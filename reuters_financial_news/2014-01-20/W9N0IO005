WELLINGTON, Jan 20  (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices in December retreated from a record high, while the number of houses sold also slipped from the previous month, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Monday.

The REINZ's house price index slipped 1.0 percent from the month before, to be 9.2 percent higher than the same month a year earlier. The number of houses sold was down 18.3 percent on November. The housing market has picked up since early 2012, particularly in Auckland, the country's biggest city, and earthquake-damaged Christchurch, as a shortage of houses in both cities has been bolstering prices. Limits on how much retail banks can lend on low deposit home loans were imposed in October by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to try to slow the rise in house prices. "The softer trend in sales noted in November 2013 continued into December. The shorter selling month in December means that a drop from November sales volumes is a normal part of the seasonal pattern," said REINZ chief executive Helen O'Sullivan. "While a small number of regions bucked the trend, other parts of the country recorded significantly greater falls in volume than the national figure."  The central bank has said it will start raising interest rates this year, with the state of the housing market a key factor in the timing and extent of any rises. Most analysts believe the RBNZ will start raising rates from a record low 2.5 percent in March.
