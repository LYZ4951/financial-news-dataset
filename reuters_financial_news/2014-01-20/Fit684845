Jan 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed of Hypenn RMBS I B.V., as follows:  Class A1 (ISIN NL0010511093) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class A2 (ISIN NL0010511101) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable  Class A3 (ISIN NL0010511119) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable The Dutch prime RMBS transaction, which closed in July 2013, comprises loans  originated by Nationale-Nedelanden Bank (NNB) and Nationale-Nederlanden Leven.  The originators are unrated and indirect subsidiaries of ING Group  (A/Negative/F1). The servicer is ING Bank (A+/Negative/F1+).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Performance  The affirmations reflect the performance of the underlying assets. As of the  December 2013 payment date, three-month plus arrears stood at 0.05% of the  current pool balance, and no foreclosures had been reported.  Reserve Fund The non-amortising reserve fund has been fully funded by capturing excess spread  and stands at its target of 1.0% of the mortgage balance as of closing. The  reserve fund is available to cover interest shortfalls and clear principal  deficiency ledgers on all notes.  Revolving Period The transaction is in a five-year and five-month revolving period until November  2018 and Fitch expects credit enhancement to start increasing thereafter. Fitch  has analysed a potential shift in portfolio characteristics during the remainder  of the revolving period and modelled a worst-case scenario. The analysis showed  that the available credit enhancement is sufficient to withstand these stresses.  Nationale Hypotheek Garantie (NHG) Loans The portfolio comprises 21.6% NHG loans. Fitch did not apply a reduction in base  foreclosure frequency for the NHG loans, as the historical data received from  the originator did not show a difference in the performance of NHG and non-NHG  loans. Fitch also used historical claim data received from the Waarborgfonds  Eigen Wonigen (WEW) to determine the compliance ratio assumption, which led to  higher recovery rates for NHG loans.
