HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Shanghai Composite Index closed below the 2,000-point mark for the first time in 5-1/2 months on Monday as soaring short-term funding costs deepened uneasiness that new listings will inject more competition for already limited cash.

The Shanghai benchmark <.SSEC> ended down 0.7 percent at 1,991.3 points, the first time it has closed below the 2,000 level since July 31. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings shed 0.6 percent. [ID:nL3N0KU10S] Eight companies said they expect to make their listing debuts in Shenzhen on Tuesday, with five on the ChiNext board. The ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mainly startups in nascent industries sank 1.4 percent.   China's benchmark seven-day repo rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> soared by as much as 125 basis points to 6.42 percent on Monday, stoking fears of a repeat of the end-June cash crunch. Demand typically rises near month-end, which in January coincides with the Lunar New Year. [ID:nL3N0KU1VL]
