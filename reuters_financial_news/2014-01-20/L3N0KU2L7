MUMBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Monday after two days of losses as software services exporters gained after Wipro posted solid earnings and joined domestic rivals in giving a positive outlook for the sector.

Value-buying also boosted recent underperformers, including lenders such as State Bank of India <SBI.NS> and more defensive stocks such as cigarette maker ITC Ltd <ITC.NS>. However, broader gains were capped as Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> fell after its October-December quarterly profit when adjusted for other income was seen lagging expectations. Investors are also growing hopeful the Reserve Bank of India will keep interest rates on hold at its policy review on Jan. 28, which analysts say could spur additional gains in shares. "For the markets to sustain, we require a lot of good news from the RBI. The policy review is going to be the biggest trigger for the market in the short term," said Mehraboon Irani, head of private client group at Nirmal Bang Securities. "All economy-related stocks will continue to disappoint, while defensive sectors like pharma and IT will continue to outperform the broader markets."

[ID:nL3N0KQ3QP] Banking shares closed higher with State Bank of India <SBI.NS> gaining 1.3 percent ahead of the RBI policy review as investors expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged.
