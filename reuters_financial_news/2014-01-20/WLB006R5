LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - New British lender Metro Bank is on track to make a profit next year, having doubled its number of customer accounts in 2013, founder and Chairman Vernon Hill told Reuters in an interview.

Metro Bank, which launched in 2010 as Britain's first new high street lender for more than a century, said on Sunday it had raised 387.5 million pounds ($636 million) to fund its expansion plans by selling stock to institutional and private investors. [ID:nL5N0KT0DN]
