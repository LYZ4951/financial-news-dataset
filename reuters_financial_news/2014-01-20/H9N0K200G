HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Glorious Property shares tumbled more than 25 percent on Monday after shareholders rejected a bid by its billionaire owner to take the company private for HK$4.57 billion.

Glorious Property Holdings Ltd <0845.HK> shares were down 25.2 percent at 0132 GMT in Hong Kong, their lowest since mid-October after the company said in an exchange statement that 62 of 120 shareholders voted against Zhang Zhirong's proposal.
