CAIRO, June 22 (Reuters) - Egypt's newly appointed investment minister Ashraf Salman said he targets $10 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) for the coming fiscal year and $14 billion in three years.

Egypt had been hit by an economic crisis following a 2011 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Hosni Mubarak. FDI for the first nine months of 2013-14 fiscal year stood at $4.4 billion. Egypt's financial year starts on July 1.
