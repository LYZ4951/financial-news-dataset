JERUSALEM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's Maalot on Thursday raised its rating for Mizrahi-Tefahot <MZTF.TA>, Israel's fourth-largest bank, to "AAA" from "AA+", citing declining risks in the banking sector and improved capital at the lender.

The Israeli unit of S&P set a "stable" outlook for Mizrahi-Tefahot's rating.
