BANGKOK, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Thailand's key stock index fell for a third straight day while Vietnam's benchmark ended a three-day winning streak on Thursday, hit by selling in large-cap energy shares as global oil prices slid and investors stayed on the sidelines during the holiday season.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> fell 1.3 percent to 1,504.89, the lowest close since Dec. 17, and has lost 2 percent over three consecutive days of declines. Shares of PTT <PTT.BK>, PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK> and PTT Global Chemical <PTTGC.BK> each slipped almost 3 percent. Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> dropped 1.4 percent, trimming some of the combined 3.1 percent gain of the previous three days. Among losers, shares of PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, the biggest company by market value, tumbled 4.2 percent.
