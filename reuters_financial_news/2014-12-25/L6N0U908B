DUBAI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The board of Saudi Arabia's Alinma Bank <1150.SE> recommended a dividend of 0.5 riyal per share for 2014, a bank official said on Thursday.

Earlier, Alinma said in a statement to the Saudi stock exchange that the dividend would be 5.0 riyals. But a bank official, contacted by telephone, subsequently told Reuters that was wrong and the correct figure was 0.5 riyal. It would be the bank's first dividend since it listed on the stock market in 2008.
