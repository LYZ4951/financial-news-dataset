DUBAI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets may lose steam on Thursday after global oil prices pulled back overnight, with Brent crude <LCOc1> again testing the psychologically important $60 a barrel level.

Boourses rose strongly on Wednesday on anticipation that the Saudi Arabian 2015 state budget, expected to be announced on Thursday, possibly during Saudi market trading hours, would keep spending high. The country's Al-Madina newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, reported earlier this week that the budget would actually contain a marginal rise in spending, with the government using its huge fiscal reserves to cover a deficit. [ID:nL6N0U70A5] This helped the Saudi index <.TASI> climb 1.8 percent to 8,700 points on Wednesday while Dubai <.DFMGI> rose 3.0 percent. In past years, however, the Saudi market has often risen before the annual budget announcement and then stalled or pulled back for a few days afterwards as investors take profits. Also, even if strong government spending insulates Gulf economies from cheap oil prices, any renewed fall by Brent below $60 in coming days or weeks would probably have a psychological impact on retail investors in equities.  Oil's overnight fall was due to data showing U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose by 7.3 million barrels last week to their highest December level on record.
