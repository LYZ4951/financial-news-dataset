SHANGHAI, Jan 4 (Reuters) - China's central bank will require interest rate swaps to be conducted via a central clearing house, in a move to reduce counterparty risk in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, the central bank said.

Shanghai Clearing House, one of two state-backed clearing houses for China's interbank bond market, will handle clearing for IRS trades. IRS have been traded in China since 2005 but were previously settled bilaterally, with no central clearing. The problem of systemic risk to the financial system from OTC derivatives emerged during the 2008 financial crisis, when governments stepped in to bail out firms like American International Group Inc. <AIG.N> that were unable to pay money owed to counterparties on loss-making derivatives trades. The change will support the "safe and efficient functioning of the over-the-counter derivatives market," the People's Bank of China said in a statement posted on its website.  In centrally cleared trades, a clearing house serves as nominal counterparty to every trade, standing between the two ultimate counterparties. If one party lacks the funds to pay its debt, the clearing house, which is subject to capital adequacy rules, will pay what is owed, preventing the other party from suffering losses.  Forcing over-the-counter derivatives to be centrally cleared was a key provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that the U.S. passed in 2010.
