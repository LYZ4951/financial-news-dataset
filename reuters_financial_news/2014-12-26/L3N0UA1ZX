HANOI, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed up 0.26 percent on Friday, as gains in some big-caps provided a cushion for falls in many other shares, led by PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, the country's biggest firm by market value.

GAS shares advanced 3.68 percent, rebounding from Thursday's tumble triggered by a slip in global oil prices, while Hanoi-based lender Vietcombank <VCB.HM> climbed 3.01 percent in solid volume. Shareholders of Vietcombank, Vietnam's top lender by market value, approved on Friday a merger guideline that would allow its board of directors to find "an appropriate partner" and to propose a merger project with another lender, Vietcombank said on its web site. Analysts and traders said VCB shares are in focus of foreign long-term funds as energy stocks have been slipping off the table due to a gloomy global sector outlook while banking equities are of offshore investors' appetite.
