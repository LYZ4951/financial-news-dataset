Dec 25 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's Ratings Services is nearing a settlement with regulators over their investigation of how the company graded real-estate bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The proposed deal, which could be reached as early as next month, is a joint settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, the newspaper reported. (http://on.wsj.com/1tiyOP6) The settlement could involve a suspension of S&P for several months or even a year from rating some deals and a fine of at least $60 million, the Journal said. S&P spokeswoman Catherine Mathis, representatives at the SEC, the NY AG's office and Coakley's office could not be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. In October, S&P's parent McGraw Hill Financial Inc <MHFI.N> said it was in "active" settlement talks with federal and state regulators over its ratings on six commercial mortgage-backed securities and took a $60 million charge in the third quarter for a possible accord. [ID:nL1N0SO1TA] S&P suffered a huge blow to its commercial mortgage-backed securities business in 2011, after a major error on a $1.5 billion deal caused its market share to shrink. It isn't clear whether S&P will be asked to admit wrongdoing, the Journal said. The U.S. Department of Justice sued S&P for $5 billion in February 2013, accusing it of issuing inflated ratings before the 2008 financial crisis to win more fees from issuers, and failing to downgrade debt backed by mortgage-backed securities fast enough. That lawsuit remains pending.
