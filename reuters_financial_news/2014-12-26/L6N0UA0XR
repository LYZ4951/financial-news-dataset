MOSCOW, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Friday it would provide up to 1.1 trillion roubles ($20.4 billion) at a three-month credit auction secured by non-marketable assets on Jan. 12.

That would be a record amount offered at this type of auction. The central bank is taking steps to alleviate a shortage of roubles in the money market.
