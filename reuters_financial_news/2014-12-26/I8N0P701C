MUMBAI, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Indian shares closed higher on Friday, snapping a two-day losing streak, led by technology stocks such as Infosys <INFY.NS> on a weaker rupee while broader sentiment was tepid as investors kept away from risky bets ahead of the year-end holidays.    The Indian rupee stayed down against the dollar on month-end dollar demand and profit booking by foreign investors. The partially convertible rupee was at 63.65 versus its previous close of 63.5150/5250. [INR/]
