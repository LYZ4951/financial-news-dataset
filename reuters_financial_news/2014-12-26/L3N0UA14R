SHANGHAI, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A Chinese court ruled against a former Everbright Securities executive who sued the country's securities regulator for punishing him for insider trading.

In February, Yang Jianbo, former general manager of a high-frequency trading unit at Everbright Securities <601788.SS>, sued the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), challenging the lifetime ban from the industry and 600,000 yuan ($99,000) fine that the regulator imposed on him in November 2013.   The Beijing First Intermediate Court ruled against Yang, according to a statement on Weibo, the court's official messaging service. Calls to Yang's mobile phone were not answered. The CSRC had said that after a computer malfunction on Aug. 16, 2013 caused Everbright to take a 7.27 billion yuan long position in a commonly-traded exchange-traded fund, Yang and his colleagues committed insider trading by partially unwinding that position later that day without properly disclosing the original trading error.
