BANGKOK, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Malaysia's key index hit a more than two-week high on Friday, marking the best weekly gain in 19 months, as inflows from domestic institutions lifted large caps while the Thai benchmark rebounded after late buying in dividend-yielding stocks.

Malaysia's FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI index <.KLSE> rose 0.8 percent to 1,764.44, the highest close since Dec. 10, with shares of Public Bank <PUBM.KL> up 3.1 percent, the top gainer on the index and among actively-traded stocks by turnover. The key index notched up a 2.8 percent gain on the week, the biggest since the week ended May 10, 2013. Domestic institutions bought shares worth a net 80.6 million ringgit ($23.10 million) while foreign and local investors were net sellers, stock exchange data showed. Thai SET index <.SETI> edged up 0.4 percent, trimming losses on the week to 0.3 percent, its third straight week of declines, led by shares of dividend yielding telecoms such as Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> and Intuch Holdings <INTUCH.BK>. Singapore was among outperformers on the week, with the key Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> 2.3 percent, ending three consecutive weeks of losses. The Indonesia <.JKSE> and Philippine markets <.PSI> were shut on Friday, with trading set to resume Monday. [ID:nL3N0U726Q]
