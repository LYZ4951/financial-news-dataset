BEIJING, Dec 26 (Reuters) - China's Dalian Wanda Group Co, whose real estate arm just raised about $3.7 billion in a Hong Kong share sale, has taken a controlling stake in Chinese third-party payment service provider 99Bill Corp, the Beijing-based conglomerate said on Friday.

Dalian Wanda did not disclose the amount it paid for its shareholding. Sources told Reuters earlier that the investment was expected to be valued at more than 2 billion yuan ($322.55 million). [ID:nL3N0U9173]
