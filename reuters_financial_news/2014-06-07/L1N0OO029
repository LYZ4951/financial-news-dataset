NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - A large fire broke out in the basement of a Manhattan building that sits a block away from the Rockefeller Center, fire officials said on Friday.

The fire was reported at around 8:45 p.m. (0045 GMT), said New York Fire Department spokesman Danny Glover, who added that no injuries had been reported. Within an hour, the blaze was upgraded to a three-alarm fire, according to the Fire Department's Twitter account.  People appeared to have been evacuated out of the building, Glover said. The structure, which houses a TGI Friday's restaurant on the first floor, stands six stories tall.
