SYDNEY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Australia's Treasury Wine Estates said on Monday that talks with private equity bidders for the sale of its business have ended.

Treasury, viewed as ripe for a takeover since late 2013 when it first warned of U.S. problems, had its books opened to U.S. private equity giant KKR & Co LP <KKR.N> and another private equity player, reported to be TPG Capital Management [TPG.UL], for rival $3.1 billion takeover bids.
