SYDNEY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> on Monday said it has agreed to sell its 17.5 percent stake in Vietnam's Saigon Securities Incorporation (SSI) as the lender focuses on improving returns in Asia.

It did not disclose terms of the sale to SSI chairman and a group of Vietnamese investors but said the transaction was "not material".
