The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> fell 90 points, the biggest drop in a week, to 5,321.8 at the close of trade. On Monday, the index rose 0.7 percent. Energy stocks Sundance <SEA.AX>, Santos <STO.AX> and Drillsearch <DLS.AX> took a beating as oil slumped to near 5-year lows while Qantas <QAN.AX> shares took off for a second straight session, rising to near 4-year highs.
