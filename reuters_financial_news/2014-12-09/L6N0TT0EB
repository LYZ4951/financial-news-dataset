NAIROBI, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Kenya will increase spending by 10 percent in the 2015/16 fiscal year (July-June) to 1.849 trillion shillings ($20.46 billion), the finance ministry said on Tuesday.

The Treasury said in a pre-budget presentation the government planned to borrow 141.2 billion shillings from the domestic market to partly plug a predicted budget deficit of 6.8 percent of GDP during the period.
