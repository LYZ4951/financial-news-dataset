LIMA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Peru's central bank will likely hold the benchmark interest rate <PECBIR=ECI> at 3.50 percent on Thursday as the currency slips and the economy shows signs of recovery, a majority of analysts polled by Reuters said.

Eight out of 11 foreign and local economists surveyed said the central bank would leave the key rate unchanged. The remaining three said the bank would likely cut the rate by 25 basis points for the third time this year to spur still-sluggish growth. Peru's economy is set to expand by around 3 percent this year, following rates that tended to top 6 percent amid a mining boom in the past decade. Some analysts who forecast a hold said the bank will aim to avoid further weakening the sol currency <PEN=PE> <PEN=>, which has slipped 5.7 percent so far this year and closed at a new five-year-low on Tuesday. A lower interest rate would likely encourage investors to swap even more soles for dollars. On Friday, Central Bank President Julio Velarde said he saw room for a looser monetary policy in coming months. [ID:nL2N0TP0Z8] Consumer prices in Peru fell 0.15 percent in November as the annual rate remained slightly above the central bank's 1-3 percent target range for the second month in a row. [ID:nP3N0OY00K] The central bank loosened reserve rules on deposits in soles again this month - a pro-growth policy it has said it prefers to cutting the rate. In September, economic growth continued picking up since expanding by just 0.3 percent in June, for the weakest expansion in five years.
