WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Intervening in the market for government bonds would send a strong signal about the European Central Bank's willingness to be accommodative and could indirectly encourage bank lending, the ECB's chief economist said on Tuesday.

In remarks spelling out the benefit of fresh money printing to buy government bonds, Peter Praet said the market's size posed no general limitations and that buying into it could also have a positive spillover into expectations for price inflation. "Interventions in this market would ... likely entail a stronger signal that the ECB ... is committed to maintain an accommodative stance for an extended period of time," Praet told an audience in Washington. "For banks, broader portfolio effects might entail a shift out of government bonds - or other fixed-income instruments - and into loan creation," he said.
