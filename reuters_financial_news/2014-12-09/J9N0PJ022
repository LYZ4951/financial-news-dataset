JAKARTA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank governor said it is always in the forex market to guard against rupiah volatility, but it was not targeting a specific level for the currency, which has fallen to its weakest since 2008.

"Bank Indonesia is always in the market, but the main purpose is to guard against volatility, not aiming for a certain level (for the rupiah)," Governor Agus Martowardojo told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday.  "We have to understand that the regional (currencies) are weakening," he said.
