LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - FxPro, the retail-focused foreign exchange broker, said on Tuesday it had launched a new service offering prime brokerage services to small and mid-sized institutions.

FxPro Prime would offer so-called 'prime of prime' services, whereby it pools together trades volumes to help it source the best trade execution price from a range of liquidity providers. The move comes as changing rules around risk management force many investment banks to reconsider which clients they service and to what extent.
