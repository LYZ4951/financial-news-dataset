BUDAPEST, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Hungarian central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy told a parliament committee on Tuesday the deflationary environment in the European Union, partly resulting from low oil prices, was a risk to the country in 2015.

He also warned that low growth and employment problems in the wider EU were problems for each member state, adding that his bank would focus on aiding growth.
