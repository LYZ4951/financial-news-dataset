WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not be influenced in its ongoing debate about expanded asset purchases by a judicial review of its existing sovereign bond buying program.

A European court is reviewing the ECB's program of Outright Monetary Transactions, a mechanism that has never been used but in principle allows the ECB to purchase government bonds of stressed nations.  The ECB is considering including sovereign debt in a broader asset purchase program meant to prop up the European economy. Praet said the deliberations over that decision will not be influenced by the case challenging the OMT program.
