CAIRO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Egypt's financial regulator on Thursday extended the offer period for UAE's Abraaj Investment Management for Egyptian cake and biscuit maker Bisco Misr <BISM.CA> to December 24 to match the period of rival bidder Kellogg Co <K.N>.

"Applying the principle of equal opportunity... the authority has no objection to extending the period of the offer," the regulator said in a statement to the Cairo bourse. Bisco Misr set off a bidding war with Kellogg by offering 82.2 Egyptian pounds ($11.50) per share, trumping Abraaj's previous bid of 80.58 pounds ($11.27).
