NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday sold $25 billion in one-year bills at an interest rate of 0.21 percent, the highest since April 2011, Treasury data showed. [ID:nZXN0DBZ00]

The amount of bids for the latest one-year T-bill issue <912796FN4=> to the amount offered, which gauges overall demand at the auction, was 3.44. the lowest since December 2009. "This was not a great auction," Tom Simons, money market strategist at Jefferies & Co. wrote in a research note. Another sign of weak demand for this short-term U.S. government debt instrument was the large purchase from primary dealers, or the 22 top Wall Street firms that do business with the Federal Reserve. They typically resell the Treasury securities they buy at auction on the open market.
