MUMBAI, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, down to their lowest in one month, as investors cashed out tracking a selloff in Chinese markets and hurt blue-chips such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally fell 1.15 percent to 27,797.01, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> closed down 1.16 percent at 8,340.70.
