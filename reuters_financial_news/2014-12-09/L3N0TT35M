MUMBAI, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, with the NSE index closing at a one-month low, as investors cashed out positions tracking a selloff in Chinese markets, hurting blue-chips such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp.

Chinese shares plunged on Tuesday, sharply reversing course from a two-week rally fuelled in part by speculation the central bank would further ease policy, with a key stock index recording its biggest fall since the depths of the global financial crisis. [ID:nL3N0TT28R] Adding to the concerns, overseas investors turned net sellers, excluding the share sale by founders of Infosys Ltd <INFY.NS> on Monday. Foreign investors have invested about $16.6 billion so far this year, exchange and regulatory data showed. [ID:nL3N0TS17F]  "This was an expected profit-taking. Fall in Chinese markets added fuel to the fall. However, we think it's a healthy correction. It's still a buy-on-dips market," said Suresh Parmar, head, institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> closed 1.15 percent lower at 27,797.01. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> fell 1.16 percent to end at 8,340.70, its lowest since Nov. 7. Explorers took a hit. ONGC fell 4.4 percent, its biggest since July 7 after crude prices tumbled to a five-year low. Cairn India Ltd <CAIL.NS> fell 1.6 percent. [O/R] Sesa Sterlite <SESA.NS> lost 5.2 percent, adding to its 3.7 percent fall in the previous session as iron ore prices hit multi-year lows. [ID:nL3N0TT1FH] Metal stocks continued to fall for the second straight day after disappointing Chinese trade data. [ID:nL3N0TS2FK] Tata Steel <TISC.NS> closed down 3.4 percent, while Hindalco Industries <HALC.NS> ended 3 percent lower.  Banks also fell for the second straight day on profit-taking. State Bank of India <SBI.NS> closed down 2 percent, while ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> ended 1 percent lower. Among the gainers, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries <SUN.NS> rose 1.4 percent and Ranbaxy Laboratories <RANB.NS> ended 3.6 percent higher after India's antitrust regulator approved Sun's $3.2 billion bid to buy its smaller rival. [ID:nL3N0TS3ZN] Jet Airways Ltd <JET.NS> gained 6.2 percent, tracking a fall in crude prices.  Every $1/bbl fall in crude can boost the company's FY16 operational profit estimate by 4-5 percent, analysts said.
