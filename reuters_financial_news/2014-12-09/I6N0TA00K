MILAN, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> rose more than 4.5 percent on Tuesday, bucking a sharply lower Milan stock market, as markets welcomed regulatory efforts to push banks to complete a balance-sheet clean-up by year-end.

Traders mentioned a note by broker Equita SIM which said a push by the European Central Bank to have banks fully book in their 2014 results the outcome of a recently concluded sector review could be a "positive catalyst for banks, which could make use of the tax benefits deriving from internal models, boost their coverage ratios and further clean up their balance-sheets". Italian daily Il Messaggero cited on Tuesday an ECB letter to the banks which required them to take into account the outcome of the sector review in their 2014 results. The banks' boards and auditors must be swiftly informed of the contents of the letter, it said. Equita analysts estimated Italian banks would have to book 6.5 billion euros ($8 billion) in writedowns in the fourth quarter with Monte Paschi accounting for 1 billion euros. By 0854 GMT shares in Monte dei Paschi rose 2.4 percent as Italy's FTSE MIB index <.FTMIB> fell 1.6 percent. They were earlier suspended from trading after rising 4.6 percent.
