NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, who correctly predicted government debt yields would plunge this year, said in an interview on Tuesday there is a possibility that yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note could drop to 1 percent in 2015.

"The 10-year Treasury could join the Europeans and go to 1 percent. Why not? The European rates are at 1 percent. France is below 1 percent right now," Gundlach said.  Gundlach, who co-founded DoubleLine Capital in December 2009, noted demand for U.S. Treasuries has grown as yields on German and other European government bonds continue to fall. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield <US10YT=RR> is running more than 1.55 percentage points above the yield on 10-year German Bunds <DE10YT=RR>.  "What's really an emergency level is the negative yield on the German two-year," Gundlach added. "When you get yields at negative, basically people are so afraid that they are willing to pay you for the safe keeping of their principal." Gundlach also said a continued plunge in oil prices would give even more fuel for a bond rally. Brent crude, which has fallen more than 40 percent in the last six months, slipped to a five-year low on Tuesday.  "I still believe that there is a danger of repeat of a Treasury melt up that 2014 did end up bringing, particularly into the crescendo of October 15," Gundlach said. "If something can't go up, it has to go down. Yields can't seem to go up. They might go down. And if they go down any amount again, if the 10-year goes below 2 percent, even below 2.20 percent, that's the line in the sand I am talking about. 2.20 percent is a big number for the bond market."   DoubleLine said on Tuesday that it would launch the DoubleLine Long Duration Total Return Bond Fund to investors on Monday.
