ABU DHABI, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates central bank is looking at proposals for new rules covering bank loans against shares, a senior official said on Tuesday.

"The central bank board is studying new regulations for credit against shares," Saif al-Shamsi, assistant governor for monetary policy and financial stability, told reporters on the sidelines of a financial conference. He did not elaborate. In July, the Securities and Commodities Authority met with the central bank, the economy ministry and the Dubai and Abu Dhabi stock exchanges to discuss tightening supervision of the bourses.

The violence of the rise and fall of Arabtec shares was partly due to the fact that some buyers leveraged themselves through bank loans or other means, traders said.
