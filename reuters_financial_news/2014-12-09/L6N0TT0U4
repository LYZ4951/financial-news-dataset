LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - European shares fell sharply on Tuesday, with a further slide in crude oil prices hitting energy stocks and British grocer Tesco <TSCO.L> plunging after another profit warning.

Tesco shares fell 15 percent after it slashed its full-year outlook by almost a third in the latest downgrade sparked by an accounting scandal and intense competition in its home market. [ID:nL6N0TT0M4] The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 1.1 percent at 1,381.16 points by 0809 GMT after falling 0.7 percent in the previous session. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas <.SXEP> index fell 2.4 percent, the biggest sectoral decliner, after Brent oil slipped to a five-year low below $66 a barrel following a drop of more than 4 percent the day before on worries of a swelling supply glut. BP <BP.L>, Tullow Oil <TLW.L>, Statoil <STL.OL> and Respsol <REP.MC> fell 2 to 3.2 percent.
