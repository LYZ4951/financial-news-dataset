LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> forecast continued strong demand for aircraft funding, with commercial jet buyers using capital markets to fund a third of the $124 billion of the sales expected in 2015, the company said on Tuesday.

"The strength we're seeing in aircraft finance is largely the result of a healthy and balanced global demand for new aircraft," Boeing Capital Corporation's vice president for aircraft financial services, Tim Myers, said.  Capital markets are a growing source of funding for aircraft deliveries, up from just 3 percent in 2009.
