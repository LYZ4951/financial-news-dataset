ATHENS, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Greek stocks fell 6 percent in early trade on Tuesday, a day after the government announced it would bring forward a crucial presidential vote by two months.

At 0837 GMT, the Athens stock exchange's benchmark index <.ATG> was down 6.1 percent at 971.06 points, with the Greek bank index <.FTATBNK> falling 8.8 percent. "There is uncertainty for the period after the presidential vote. There is fear that there will be no new president and we will move to national elections," Manos Hatzidakis, analyst with Beta Securities said.
