MADRID, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Spain's Santander <SAN.MC> is considering buying out the 28 percent of its U.S. auto finance business that is currently listed on the stock market, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The stake in Dallas-based Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc was worth about $1.8 billion as of Monday. Santander, which owns 60 percent of the unit, views it as an undervalued asset that may perform better off the public markets, Bloomberg said. Santander declined to comment.
