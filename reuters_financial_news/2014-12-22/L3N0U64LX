SYDNEY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares will likely tread water on Tuesday as investors pause after a 4-day rally while falling commodities and oil prices will further weigh on sentiment.

Stock index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.3 percent overnight to 5,393 points, a 49-points discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>. The benchmark closed up 2 percent on Monday. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.3 percent in early trade. Telstra <TLS.AX> will be in focus after Australia's largest telecom services provider said it would buy Pacnet Ltd for $697 million. [ID:nL3N0U64GJ] Energy companies such as Santos <STO.AX> and Woodside Petroleum <WPL.AX> will also be watched after oil resumed its downward march.
