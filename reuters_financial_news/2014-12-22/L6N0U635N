MILAN, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> said on Monday it had sold non-performing loans worth 380 million euros to U.S. private equity firm Fortress Investment Group <FIG.N>, the latest in a raft of disposals of soured debts by Italian banks.

Monte dei Paschi had signed a similar deal with Fortress for bad loans with a book value of 500 million euros in June. In a statement, Italy's No.3 lender said however that the economic impact of the sale would not be significant as these assets are normally sold at a big discount.
