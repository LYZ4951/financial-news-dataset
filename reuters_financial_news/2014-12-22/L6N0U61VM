VIENNA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Owners of part-nationalised Austrian lender Volksbanken AG (VBAG) <OTVVp.VI> are set to approve on Tuesday plans to wind down the bank to address a looming capital gap that supervisors have still not said whether it needs to fill.

Volksbanken, in which the state has 43 percent after a 2012 rescue, said in October it would hand over some assets to one of the regional banks that own a 52 percent majority and then wind down the rest of its assets over years. [ID:nL6N0RX4TA] By relinquishing its banking license next year it would be freed from minimum bank capital requirements, relieving pressure on the rest of the group that flagship VBAG dragged into failing this year's ECB-led health checks of big euro zone lenders. The test exposed an 865 million euro ($1.06 billion) capital hole as of 2016, but did not reflect the restructuring steps that loss-making VBAG had announced weeks before. [ID:nL5N0SL0IL] With the state opposed to injecting more aid on top of the 1.35 billion euros Volksbanken already received, and the regional bank owners unable to chip in, it remains unclear who would foot the bill should supervisors insist on a capital top-up. That has left Austrian officials and VBAG on tenterhooks. VBAG's planned conversion into a "bad bank" will trigger around 505 million euros in writedowns this year and wipe out more than half its capital. [ID:nL6N0TV2PK] The European Central Bank has given initial approval to plans by 13 banks to plug holes revealed by stress tests, but the final word on VBAG will come from the ECB Governing Council in early 2015. [ID:nL6N0TW36G] One government official cited concern that the ECB, which took on supervision of big banks in November, may take a hard line on VBAG to establish a reputation for toughness. "Why should money be pumped into a bank that will anyway be wound down next year?," another source close to the matter asked. "The state has said often enough it won't inject more money and the (regional) Volksbanks can't." The Financial Market Authority supervisor has ordered VBAG to add an item on "possible capital measures" to the agenda for a shareholder meeting on Tuesday but it was unclear what if any such steps could be agreed at this stage.
