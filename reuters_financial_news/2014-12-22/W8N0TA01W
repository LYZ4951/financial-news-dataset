WARSAW, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Eastern Europe's largest insurer PZU is not currently interested in taking over banks in Poland, said a PZU board member Przemyslaw Dabrowski, defying speculations that the company is mulling taking over one the lenders for sale.

"Today, we don't see a reason which would make us enter such a process (of buying a bank)," Dabrowski told reporters.
