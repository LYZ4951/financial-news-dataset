BRASILIA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said on Monday that her administration would hold an initial public offering of state-run mortgage lender Caixa Economica Federal <CEF.UL>, though she did not foresee this happening soon.

Listing shares of Caixa would allow the federal government to raise much-needed funds as it focuses on improving fiscal discipline and warding off a potential downgrade of Brazil's credit rating. "I will (publicly list Caixa), but it is a slow process," Rousseff told reporters after a press breakfast in Brasilia, without elaborating further. Caixa is Brazil's third-largest bank by total assets and the nation's top issuer of home loans. In September the bank had assets of 1 trillion reais ($377.36 billion), according to central bank data.
