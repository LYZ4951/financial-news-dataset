Dec 22 (Reuters) - Money manager F-Squared Investments Inc has agreed to pay $35 million to resolve U.S. regulatory charges that it defrauded investors with false performance claims about its flagship product.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday it also separately charged Howard Present, F-Squared's co-founder and former chief executive, with making false and misleading statements to investors.
