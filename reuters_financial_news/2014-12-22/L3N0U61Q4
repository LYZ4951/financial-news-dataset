BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China's state-owned enterprise (SOE) profits continued to be squeezed by heavy financing costs in November, maintaining a trend that started earlier this year, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said in a report released Monday.

Total revenue at China's state-owned non-financial firms increased 3.9 percent during the first 11 months of the year, to 43.4 trillion yuan ($6.97 trillion), slowing from 4.5 percent growth for the January-to-October period. [ID:nL3N0TF476] Revenue gains continued to be outstripped by operating costs, which increased 4.3 percent during the period, compared with the same period a year earlier. Finance expenses were the primary driver, increasing 17.3 percent. Finance costs for the country's 113 central government-controlled enterprise groups, which accounted for more than 60 percent of state sector non-financial firm revenue, jumped 19.7 percent, the MOF said. China's central bank in November announced the first cut in interest rates in more than two years, in a move that may help Chinese companies manage the rising cost of borrowing and help stimulate economic activity. The Chinese government also is undertaking a series of reforms aimed at improving the efficiency, competitiveness and transparency of its state-owned industry. SOE reforms will adapt to the new normal of economic growth, enlarge and strengthen state firms, and emphasize costs reductions, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a separate report on Monday, citing a meeting of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the Beijing agency repsonsible for overseeing central government SOEs. China's state sector reported a 4.5 percent increase in total profits for the first 11 months, to 2.24 trillion yuan, the MOF said, slowing from 6.08 percent growth for the first 10-month period.  Firms in the nonferrous metals, coal, chemicals, petroleum and petrochemical industries continued to report declining net income.
