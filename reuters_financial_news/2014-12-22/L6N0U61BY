RABAT, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Morocco's consumer price inflation rose to an annual 1.2 percent in November from 0.6 pct in October in part because of rising food prices, the High Planning Authority said on Monday.

Non-food inflation was up 2.1 percent in the 12 months through November. The food price index pushed up slightly to 0.1 percent from the previous month. Health expenses fell 1.1 percent while housing, water and electricity costs rose 4.4 percent as the North African government started to cut subsidies. On a month-on-month basis, the consumer price index was steady in November after rising 0.6 percent in October. The food price index rose 0.2 percent on the month and non-food prices were down 0.1 percent.
