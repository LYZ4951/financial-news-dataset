FRANKFURT, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Germany's Carl Zeiss Meditec <AFXG.DE> said late on Monday it had signed a deal with Oraya Therapeutics under which it will provide funding to the U.S.-based firm for its growth strategy for up to two years.

In return, Carl Zeiss Meditec will receive rights to a stake in Oraya, reaching up to a majority, after two years, the company said, without saying how much funding it would provide to the U.S.-based firm. Oraya has over the past few years developed a low energy radiation therapy called "Oraya Therapy" for the eye disease wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and introduced it to the market, according to Carl Zeiss Meditec.
