Dec 21 (Reuters) - Struggling retailer American Apparel Inc <APP.A> said it has adopted a new, one-year stockholder rights plan with a 10 percent trigger.

"The board implemented the rights plan as an additional means to ensure that all American Apparel stockholders are treated fairly," the Los Angeles-based retailer said in a statement late on Sunday. [ID:nPn4Qd7Q4] Each right will entitle its holder to purchase, for $3.25 each, a number of shares of the company's common stock or substantially equivalent securities having a market value of twice such price, American Apparel said. The company has been approached by private-equity firm Irving Place Capital for a possible takeover, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing sources. [ID:nL3N0U30AK] The retailer fired its Chief Executive Dov Charney last week, ending a tenure racked with sexual assault allegations and scandal. [ID:nL1N0U029U] In July, Charney increased his ownership of American Apparel to about 43 percent through a loan from hedge fund Standard General, although the fund controls his stake as collateral.
