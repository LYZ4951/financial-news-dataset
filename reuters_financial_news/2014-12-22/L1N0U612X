WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on Monday said the historic new ties between the United States and Cuba make it more likely that the Cuba government will return fugitives sought by U.S. officials.

"Certainly, we're working with that country and every country to get back fugitives who we have charges against," he told reporters at a Department of Justice press briefing.
