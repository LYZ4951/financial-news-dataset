Dec 22 (Reuters) - American Apparel's board <APP.A> believes a bid by Irving Place Capital to buy the retailer for up to $1.40 per share is far too low, and any takeover offer should be "several multiples" higher, a source familiar with the board's thinking said.

While the board is reviewing the bid and isn't likely to reach a formal decision until early January, it is not actively soliciting offers, the source told Reuters on Monday.  With a new chief executive in place, the retailer - known for its provocative clothing ads - is focused on raising sales and cutting costs after a battle to fire its founding chief Dov Charney ended last week. [ID:nL1N0U029U] "This is the worst time imaginable to sell the company as it is on the verge of turning around and realizing its true value," the source said. American Apparel has hired an investment bank to help evaluate takeover offers, although the source declined to name the bank. Irving Place Capital is the only recent party to bid on the company to date.
