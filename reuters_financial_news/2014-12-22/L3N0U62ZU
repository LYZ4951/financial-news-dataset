BANGKOK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stocks rose on Monday as energy shares staged a strong rebound in line with a rise in crude oil prices, with the Malaysian index posting its best gain in more than 19 months and the Thai benchmark closing near a two-week high.

Oil rose above $62 a barrel, mirroring gains in equities, as investors became confident there would be no further substantial price loss in the run-up to the new year. [O/R] Kuala Lumpur's composite index <.KLSE>, which measures moves of 30 large-cap stocks, rose 1.6 percent, its best daily gain since May 2013. Sapurakencana Petroleum <SKPE.KL> was the top percentage gainer with a rise of 6.7 percent. Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> finished up 1.5 percent at 1,536.83, the highest closing level since Dec. 9. PTT <PTT.BK> and PTT exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK> rallied more than 4 percent each. "The market performed better than expected today because of inflows from 'domestic trigger funds' and a rally in large-cap energy shares" said Chakkrit Charoenmetachai, a senior analyst with AEC Securities. Traders said the SET index could be capped at a key resistance of 1,555 towards the end of the year due to a lack of foreign investor participation in the holiday season. Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> climbed 1.6 percent, its best single-day rise since September 2013. The Philippine index <.PSI> ended slightly higher and Vietnam <.VNI> jumped 2.8 percent.
