LISBON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Espirito Santo family's main holding company for its non-financial assets, Rioforte, has been denied controlled management by a Luxembourg court, Rioforte said on Friday.

The decision means that the company will go into liquidation. "The liquidation of the assets of Rioforte will be decided by a legal liquidator, which will be named by the court," Rioforte said in a statement. The Espirito Santo banking family's empire crumbled under huge debts this summer, forcing an emergency rescue of Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo - the bank they founded. The Luxembourg court previously also denied controlled management for two other family holding companies, pushing them into liquidation.
