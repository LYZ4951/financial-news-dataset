TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Japan's Daido Life Insurance Co plans to continue to increase its holdings of foreign bonds this fiscal year if market conditions are favourable, as domestic yields wallow at low levels, a senior official said on Friday.

Financial markets closely watch investment trends of Japan's life insurance companies, which collectively manage more than 180 trillion yen ($1.7 trillion) of assets.
