OSLO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Property firm Entra <ENTRA.OL> is confident its Norwegian market will hold up well despite the recent stock market turmoil, and sees steady growth and dividend payments ahead, the company said following its initial public offering on Friday.

"I understand the concern, but with low unemployment, continued economic growth and population growth, especially in Oslo, Norway must be one of the most interesting places when it comes to property investments," Chief Executive Klaus-Anders Nysteen told Reuters. Entra's rental revenues have grown by around five percent on average over the last few years, and the CEO expects this trend to continue. "In the first half of 2014 rental revenues increased by 14 percent from the same time last year, but that was exceptionally good, and I can't promise the same growth going forward. Annual growth of 5-6 percent is more realistic," he said. Nysteen added he's confident the company will also return cash to its owners. "The shareholders can certainly expect dividends. We have a policy of paying 60 percent of cash revenues," he said. Entra's shares were sold at 65 crowns each, in the middle of its initial 61-72 crown offer range and at the top of the 63-65 crown narrowed range. At 0955 GMT the share traded at 66 crowns. The Norwegian government will retain between 49 and 56 percent of the shares. "We are very happy about the sales process. We have a price within the range we expected, in spite of the last two weeks of market turmoil," Minister of Trade and Industry Monica Maeland told Reuters. "We are still a significant shareholder, and we have permission to sell all our shares in the company, but we still have not decided when or how much to sell," she said, adding that at least for the next half year nothing would happen.
