Oct 16 (Reuters) - Billionaire David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc plans to raise money for the first time in two years, Bloomberg reported, citing an investor.

The hedge fund plans to take advantage of the recent market turmoil, Bloomberg said. The hedge-fund will begin accepting capital from existing investors on Nov. 1 and new clients from Dec. 1, the investor told Bloomberg.
