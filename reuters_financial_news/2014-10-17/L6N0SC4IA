PARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - French food giant Danone <DANO.PA>, maker of Activia yoghurt and Evian water, has decided it wants to pursue a takeover of U.S. infant formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Group <MJN.N>, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

"Danone has done its internal strategic review and decided that Mead Johnson is its preferred acquisition," one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is private. Paris-based Danone has been grappling with falling earnings, and investors have begun to question whether the company can thrive in its current form, as it competes with much-larger rivals Nestle <NESN.VX> and Unilever <ULVR.L>. The company is also trying to reduce its dependence on slow-growth Europe, recently doing deals in emerging markets like China and Africa.  With regard to Mead Johnson, the sources did not say whether Danone had made any approach to Mead Johnson or hired any advisors. Danone and Mead Johnson declined to comment. Shares in the U.S. firm were up nearly 12 percent at $102 by 1708 GMT, while shares in Danone closed earlier at 50.91 euros, a rise on the day of just under 1 percent. Danone's shares are down nearly 3 percent this year, while the Paris market's CAC 40 index <0#.FCHI> is down 6 percent. Analysts have long said that Mead Johnson, the maker of Enfamil baby formula with a market value of $18 billion, would be a logical but ambitious move for Danone, helping it grow in Latin America and Asia. Reuters first reported in February that Danone was looking to sell its medical nutrition business, worth between 4 billion euros and 7 billion euros ($5-9 billion) depending on how much they sell, according to analysts. [ID:nL5N0LH4DT] Attention soon turned to what Danone would do with the proceeds of any sale. Several suitors including Hospira <HSP.N>, Nestle and Fresenius <FREG.DE> have held talks with the French company, but a deal is still seen as complex and slow moving.
