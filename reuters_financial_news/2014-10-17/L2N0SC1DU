NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said on Friday it halted all quoting and trading in OTC equity securities due to "a lack of current quotation information."

Finra said it imposed the halt as of 11:05:06 a.m. EDT (1505 GMT). "This morning, subscribers to our OTC Link ATS trading platform experienced significant delays in their ability to update quotes," said via email Saskia Sidenfaden, OTC Markets Group spokeswoman. "To ensure an orderly market, we closed quoting and messaging in an attempt to resolve the issue. As we continue to work through the technical issues, FINRA determined to halt trading in all OTC equity securities."  Finra said it will notify the market when quoting and trading may resume.
