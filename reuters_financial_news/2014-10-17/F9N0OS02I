RIGA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Germany is not in need of fiscal stimulus and the boost to countries on the euro zone periphery from a rise in German public investment would be negligible anyway, European Central Bank policymaker Jens Weidmann said on Friday.

The comments from Weidmann, who is chief of Germany's Bundesbank, push back at a thinly-veiled appeal from ECB President Mario Draghi for Germany to increase its public investment levels to help support the euro zone economy. "The boost to the peripheral countries from an increase in German public investment is ... likely to be negligible," Weidmann said in the next of a speech for delivery in Riga. "And with the economy operating at normal capacity utilisation, Germany is not in need of stimulus either - and this will remain the case with the revised forecasts that still foresee growth in line with potential," he added. Turning to the ECB's plans to buy asset-backed securities - bundled loans - Weidmann said such purchases "are problematic when they imply a transfer of risks from banks to the balance sheet of the central bank." "In the end, this could amount to a transfer of risks from banks to the taxpayer," he added.
