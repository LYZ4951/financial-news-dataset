TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Japan's Daido Life Insurance Co plans to continue to increase its holdings of foreign bonds this fiscal year if market conditions are favourable, as domestic yields wallow at low levels, a senior official said on Friday.

Financial markets closely watch investment trends of Japan's life insurance companies, which collectively manage more than 180 trillion yen ($1.7 trillion) of assets. Daido Life, a unit of T&D Holdings Inc <8795.T>, sold 50 billion yen of domestic bonds in the fiscal half-year that began in April and bought 300 billion yen of foreign bonds, Toru Torai, general manager of the investment planning department, told Reuters in an interview.  Recently, however, U.S. Treasury yields have dropped to low levels on safe-haven bids amid fears about the global economic outlook.  Daido predicts the 10-year Treasury yield  <US10YT=RR> will move between 2.0 percent and 3.2 percent in the second half of the fiscal year, and stand at 3.0 percent at the end of the period. However, the benchmark U.S. yield dipped below 2 percent this week, skidding to 17-month lows.  Depending on the level of interest rates, the increase in foreign bond holdings in the second half might not keep pace with the first-half increase, Torai said.  Daido plans to slightly extend the average duration of its yen bond portfolio from around 9 years at the end of fiscal 2013, he said. The company, whose assets totaled 5.57 trillion yen at the end of September, hedged about 80 percent of its foreign asset holdings against currency fluctuations as of the end of the first half, up slightly from about 76 percent at the end of March. It might consider lowering the ratio if the yen were to strengthen, Torai said.  As of March, 47 percent of its total holdings of about 490 billion yen of foreign bonds were US Treasuries, 18 percent were French debt, 17 percent German and about 4 percent from the United Kingdom. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield <JP10YTN=JBTC> dropped to a 1 1/2-year low of 0.465 percent on Friday, as the Bank of Japan's massive bond-buying programme pulls liquidity from the domestic bond market. Daido forecasts the 10-year JGB yield to move in a range between 0.4 percent and 1.0 percent in the second half of this fiscal year, and stand at 0.60 percent at the end of March 2015.It predicts the dollar will trade between 100 yen and 120 yen in the fiscal second half, and at 112 yen at the end of the period <JPY=>. It sees the euro buying between 120 yen and 160 yen, to stand at 140 yen <EURJPY=R> at the end of March. Daido kept its holdings of Japanese and domestic stocks steady in the first half, and plans to maintain its current levels the rest of this year, depending on market conditions.
