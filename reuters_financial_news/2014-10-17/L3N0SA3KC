BANGKOK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Kasikornbank PCL <KBANK.BK>, Thailand's fourth-largest lender by assets, said on Friday its third quarter net profit rose 17 percent from a year earlier, boosted by higher net interest income and continued loan growth.

The bank posted July-September net profit of 12.5 billion baht ($386.28 million), higher than the 11.68 billion baht average forecast by 10 analyts polled by Reuters.
