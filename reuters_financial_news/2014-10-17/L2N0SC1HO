FRANKFURT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius <FREG.DE> as well as buyout groups PAI and Permira are exploring an acquisition of the medical nutrition business of Danone <DANO.PA> after efforts of U.S. drugmaker Hospira <HSP.N> to buy the unit failed, people familiar with the matter said.

The business, which sells products to feed people that are ill, may reap a valuation of 4 to 5 billion euros (6.38 billion US dollar), money that the French group could use for a potential acquisition of U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Group <MJN.N>, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. [ID:nL6N0SC4FG] Danone, Fresenius, PAI and Permira declined to comment.
