OSLO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Norwegian property developer Entra completed its initial public offering at the top of its narrowed offer range on Friday after cutting the sale earlier this week, it said in a statement.

Entra sold its shares at 65 crowns apiece, in the middle of its initial 61-72 crown offer range and at the top of the 63-65 crown narrowed range. The Norwegian government will retain 56.2 percent of the firm after the IPO, which could be reduced to 49.6 percent in case the over-allotment option is fully exercised by the offering's managers. The government earlier said it could cut its stake as low as 34 percent.
