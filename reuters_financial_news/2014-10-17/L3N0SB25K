TOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - In a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japanese trade and industry minister Yuko Obuchi plans to resign following reports that political groups supporting her misused political funds, Japanese media reported on Friday.

Obuchi, a 40-year-old mother of two and the daughter of a former prime minister, has told people close to Abe she plans to quit and will discuss the matter when Abe returns on Saturday from an Asia-Europe summit in Italy, public broadcaster NHK and the Nikkei newspaper said. Regarded as a possible future contender to become Japan's first woman premier, Obuchi apologised at a parliamentary panel on Thursday after the reports of misuse of funds, possibly violating electoral and political funding laws, hit the news-stands.
