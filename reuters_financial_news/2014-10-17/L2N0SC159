BOSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Corp <BK.N>, the world's largest custody bank, said on Friday it began charging clients 0.20 percent on their euro-denominated deposits.

BNY Mellon initiated the charge on Oct. 1, reflecting a recent move by the European Central Bank to charge 20 basis points on deposits in hopes of persuading banks to lend more money to businesses and consumers.  BNY Mellon reported $221.7 billion in average deposits at the end of September. And the bank said 15 percent of that amount was in euro-denominated deposit liabilities.
