BANGKOK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Thailand's largest lender, Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK> said on Friday its third-quarter net profit rose 7 percent as improved net interest margins and non-interest income helped to offset higher loan-loss provisions.

Net profit was 9.57 billion baht ($296 million) for the July-September quarter, higher than the average 8.8 billion baht forecast by 13 analysts polled by Reuters.  At the end of September, non-performing loans were at 2.3 percent of total loans, up from 2.2 percent at the end of 2013 as some medium and large-sized clients were affected by the weak economy and fierce competition, the bank said in a statement. Loans dropped 0.6 percent in the first nine months of 2014 as the economic recovery was slower than expected.
