MUMBAI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Friday, led by gains in stocks of domestic oriented companies including lenders such as HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> on value buying and hopes a likely win for the BJP in two recent state elections would help push key reforms.

The gains, however, were not enough to avert a fourth consecutive weekly fall amid one of the most volatile spells in world markets in years. HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> provisionally rose 3.4 percent while ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> ended 3.3 percent higher.
