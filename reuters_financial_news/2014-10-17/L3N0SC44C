COLOMBO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks fell for the second straight session on Friday, led by profit-taking in select shares such as Sri Lanka Telecom Plc <SLTL.CM> and John Keells Holdings Plc <JKH.CM>, although foreign investors bought into risky assets.

Sri Lanka's main stock index <.CSE> fell 0.31 percent, or 22.60 points, to 7,234.47. Foreign investors bought a net 15.9 million rupees ($121,792) worth of shares on Friday, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 10.13 billion rupees, exchange data showed.
