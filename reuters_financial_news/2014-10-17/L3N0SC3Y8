JAKARTA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank will release a new regulation next month to manage corporate foreign-exchange debt as a move to help stabilise the rupiah, a senior Bank Indonesia official said on Friday.

All companies operating in Indonesia will have to hedge a certain portion of their external debt not covered by their forex current assets, the deputy governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, told reporters.  Firms will also be required to build up their forex reserves months ahead of debt maturities. "Essentially, in times of uncertainty, domestically and especially globally, these are the steps we take (to manage risk)," Warjiyo said. On Thursday, the government introduced a standard operating procedure for forex hedging transactions by state enterprises.

Bank Indonesia data shows that by the end of August, private external debt had increased by 12.23 percent from a year earlier to $156 billion and is almost double its size in 2010.
