SHANGHAI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished higher on Friday, lifted by signs of recovery in overseas markets and a good earnings report from one casino that lifted stocks in that sector.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.5 percent at 23,023.21 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also rose 0.5 percent.
