KAMPALA, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> was stable on Friday but was seen vulnerable due to demand from manufacturing and energy firms.

At 0903 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,675/2,685, barely changed from Thursday's close of 2,673/2,683. "I'm seeing the market is still receiving strong appetite from manufacturing and energy importers," said Ahmed Kalule, a trader at Bank of Africa.  Kalule said there was a possibility the shilling could weaken past the key support level of 2,700 next week if demand from importers remained elevated.  The local currency last traded above that level in January last year.  Traders say a seasonal surge in importer demand is expected to remain strong until December when most firms will have finished shipping in goods for year-end holiday shoppers.  On Friday, the central Bank of Uganda (BoU) removed 177.5 billion shillings ($66.38 million) worth of excess liquidity from the interbank via a seven-day repo and Kalule said the mop-up could slow down the pace of depreciation. The local currency is down 5.8 percent against the dollar in the year to date. Benon Okwenje, a trader at Stanbic Bank said the market was receiving inflows from commodity exports like coffee but that the inflows were insufficient to soak up the strong demand.
