ZURICH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> on Friday shuffled managers at its investment banking division, appointing two new executives to head up the unit alongside Gael de Boissard.

Switzerland's second-biggest bank said Jim Amine and Tim O'Hara will join the executive board and partner with de Boissard to lead the division with immediate effect. Amine will continue to be responsible for the investment banking department, while Tim O'Hara will continue to run equities. Meanwhile, de Boissard will continue to head its fixed income business and will remain CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa and a member of the executive board.
