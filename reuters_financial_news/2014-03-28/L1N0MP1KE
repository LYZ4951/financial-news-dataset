WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. risk council is planning to host a public conference on the asset management industry in late May to help U.S. regulators assess whether the sector poses systemic risks to the marketplace, the Treasury Department said Friday.

The May 19 conference, which will take place at the Treasury Department, will feature panel discussions moderated by U.S. regulatory staff and solicit thoughts from industry officials, academics and other interested parties.
