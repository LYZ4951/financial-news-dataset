MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> fell 2.2 percent to temporarily lead losers on Milan's bourse on Friday, erasing earlier gains after the Italian mid-sized lender reported full-year results.

Genoa-based Carige's stock was changing hands for 0.56 euros at 0817 GMT, after rising 1.2 percent at the open. The Italian all-share index was 0.52 percent higher. Carige said before the market opened that its core capital ratio stood at a low 5.1 percent at the end of 2013. [nL5N0MP1AL]
