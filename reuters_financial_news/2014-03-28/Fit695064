March 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded the following ratings for Corporacion Electrica Nacional S.A. (CORPOELEC): --Foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) to 'B' from 'B+';  Negative Outlook; --Approximately USD663 million of senior unsecured debt outstanding to 'B/RR4'  from 'B+/RR4'.  Concurrently, Fitch has affirmed CORPOELEC's national long-term and short-term  ratings at 'AAA(ven)' and 'F1+'.  The rating downgrade follows the downgrade of Venezuela's sovereign ratings to  'B' from 'B+' with a Negative Rating Outlook. The downgrade of the sovereign  reflects heightened macroeconomic instability and delays in the implementation  of policies to address rising inflation and distortions in the foreign exchange  (FX) market and the deterioration in Venezuela's external accounts. The Negative  Outlook signals that the lack of sustained and coherent policy adjustments could  lead to further erosion in external buffers, macroeconomic and financial  instability, and exacerbate the risk of social unrest given the high level of  political polarization. CORPOELEC's rating reflects the company's linkage to the government of Venezuela  as a state-owned entity, combined with increased government control over  business strategies and internal resources. This underscores the close link  between the company's credit profile and that of the sovereign.   KEY RATING DRIVERS CORPOELEC's ratings reflect the strong linkage to the government of Venezuela  (rated 'B', Outlook Negative by Fitch) evidenced in government ownership,  dependence on public funding to: i) carry on  day to day operations, ii) honor  financial obligations and iii) finance capital expenditure, budget control   executed by Oficina Nacional de Presupuesto (ONAPRE) and the General Controller  of the Republic of Venezuela. The ratings also incorporate the company's  monopolistic condition as the sole provider of electricity services in the  country (generation, transmission, distribution and retail), a role that  highlights its strategic importance for the economy as a whole. The Negative  Outlook reflects the Negative Outlook on Venezuela's 'B' sovereign rating.  Ratings Linked to the Government CORPOELEC's credit profile reflects its strong credit linkage with the Republic  of Venezuela as the latter is closely integrated within the public sector. The  company's sole shareholder is the Ministry of Popular Power for Electricity  (MPPE), which has a public mandate to operate the nation's electricity sector  according to its planning directives and heavily depends on public sector  transfers and subsidies for the sustainability of its operations. The company  receives explicit support from both the Central Government, through operational  and capital expenditure allocations contained in the nation's budget and from  PDVSA in the form of subsidized fuel costs. Since April 2013, the company is  controlled by a special committee ('Junta Interventora') appointed by the  Government.   Operational Results Impacted by Tariff Scheme  The state's control of CORPOELEC renders the entity as a vehicle for public  policy implementation and therefore highly exposes it to political interference  in its day-to-day operations. The tariff scheme was fixed between 2002 and 2013;  tariffs were recently increased, and the company expects further adjustments.  These changes are intended to make the sector more sustainable, but subsidies  are expected to remain in the near future. The tariff lag tends to increase  CORPOELEC's dependence on public funding going forward, which will increase the  linkage to the sovereign as its stand-alone credit profile deteriorates over  time due to low tariffs preventing the recovery of operational costs.  Sovereign Support Needed to Fund CAPEX:  CORPOELEC executed a USD3.3 billion CAPEX in FY 2012. Sources of financing came  from FONDEN, Fondo Miranda, Fondo Conjunto Chino Venezolano (FCCV) and PDVSA.  Future capital expenditures will depend on public funds as the company is  expected to continue posting negative EBITDA generation.   Monopolistic Position CORPOELEC is a vertically integrated public utility in charge of the operation  of the country's electricity assets and the provision of electricity services in  Venezuela. The entity was created in 2007 when the reorganization of the  electricity sector took place, reserving the rights to operate the electricity  sector to the State. The entity perfected a merger by absorption of all  generation assets and transmission, distribution and electric power retail  infrastructure in the country by the end of 2011, affording it an installed  capacity of 25,890 MW and a client base of 6.1 million users by December 2012.  CORPOELEC's monopolistic position conveys the company strategic relevance to the  country given the essential nature of the service provided and the electricity  sector's correlation with GDP growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include a downgrade of  the sovereign. Also lack of the needed government support for CORPOELEC's to  carry its operations, service its financial obligations and fund its capex could  result on a negative rating action. Although unlikely, CORPOELEC's ratings could be positively affected by an  upgrade of the Sovereign.
