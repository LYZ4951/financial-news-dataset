HANOI, March 28 (Reuters) - The benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed up 0.7 percent on Friday as bargain-hunting in blue-chips extended into a second session and investors expected companies to report positive earnings next month, an analyst said.

Food maker Masan <MSN.HM> led the gains with a 2.58 percent jump, while Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, the country's largest bank by market capitalisation, rose 1.32 percent. "Bargain hunters focused on blue-chip companies, which are expected to deliver strong performance reports next month," said analyst Tran Thang Long at BIDV Securities. The Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange had touched a two-week low on Wednesday as investors looked to cut margin trading levels. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT).
