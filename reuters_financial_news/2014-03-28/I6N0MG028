MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> expects net profit to reach 122 million euros ($167.62 million) in 2016 from a deep loss last year, the Italian mid-sized lender said in slides posted on its website on Friday.

Net profit should hit 219 million euros in 2018, it added. The Genoa-based bank, which is planning a rights issue to boost a balance sheet damaged by the longest recession in its home market since World War Two, posted a net loss of 1.76 billion euros for 2013 earlier on Friday. [nL5N0MP17T]
