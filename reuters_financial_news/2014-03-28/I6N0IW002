MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, does not see any opportunity for acquisitions for the time being, its CEO Carlo Messina said on Friday.

In a conference call with analysts, Messina ruled out an acquisition in Italy in any case. He also said the bank did not plan a conversion of its savings shares into ordinary shares for now.
