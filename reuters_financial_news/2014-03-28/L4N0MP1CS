March 28 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's Ratings Services on Friday affirmed its AA plus/A-1 plus long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on Austria, saying the outlook was stable.

The affirmation reflects Austria's stable governance and predictable economic policies supporting growth, the agency said.
