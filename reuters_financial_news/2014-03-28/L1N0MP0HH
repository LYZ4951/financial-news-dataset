NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The shift in the stock market, away from momentum names and toward value, is encouraging at least in some sense because it points to an ongoing appetite for equities, rather than a reduction in interest there.

However, one has to add the caveat that the Federal Reserve is still very much a part of this market, even as it diminishes its footprint. The $55 billion in bond buying per month definitely continues to underpin rates and keep funding costs low for companies.  Still, the market has reduced its reliance on the central bank and yet bond yields continue to sink, at least in the long-dated part of the curve, where the 30-year note neared 3.50 percent and the 10-year came close to 2.60 percent yet again. The immediate expectation would seem to be for still-higher rates, particularly in the short end of the curve, where investors would be thought to trim positioning as the yield curve flattens.  The market-implied rates suggest bonds are still a ways behind where the survey expectations are for the Federal Reserve - a two-year rate of just 0.45 percent will do that.  On the other hand, Citigroup analysts point out that the Fed has been consistently overestimating inflation and growth, and the Fed continues to want to adjust its target for when it will start raising rates, moving most recently from "definitely when unemployment hits 6.5 percent!" to "definitely when we say so, based on lots of indicators or something!"  So, maybe it's not an underestimation so much as it is prudence. And those expecting more curve flattening, that is, buying in the short end and selling in the long end, would be ignoring that forward rates - the market's expectations for rates going out into the future - already imply substantial flattening out (47 basis points between the 10 and 30, compared with 56 basis points in June 2004 when the Fed last began rate increases). What's that make out as? Essentially, Citigroup thinks it's not a given that the short end will continue to sell off in a rapid fashion, but that things might take time, and the market is already on some levels pricing in a rate increase.
