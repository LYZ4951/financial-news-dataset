SHANGHAI, March 28 (Reuters) - China's money rates ended the week up after rising sharply on Thursday, following a stronger-than-expected drain executed by the central bank and showed no reaction to rumours of stimulus or monetary easing roiling the stock markets.

Chinese premier Li Keqiang was quoted in the official Xinhua news service's English language version saying Beijing would keep growth within a "reasonable range" and would also roll out targeted policies, including speeding up certain investment projects and building more affordable housing. [ID:nL4N0MP0CQ] Most importantly, perhaps, Li said China would reduce corporate financing costs through monetary policy instruments. "We take his speech as another signal that the pace of policy easing may pick up," wrote Zhang Zhiwei, economist at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong. "Without a pick-up in policy easing, growth will likely drop below 7 percent in Q2 or Q3. We reiterate our view that both monetary and fiscal policies will be loosened in Q2. We expect a cut of reserve requirement ratio by 50 bps in Q2 and another cut in Q3."  So far this sentiment has yet to trickle into the price of money, however, which continued to rise as cash demand to meet month-end regulatory payments rose, and traders told Reuters they saw nothing indicating dramatic change from previous policy in Li's speech. The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood slightly over 4 percent by midday, down slightly from Thursday's spike but still elevated, up around 60 basis points for the week. Other major traded rates also rose. The overnight repo was averaging around 2.75 percent, up 26 basis points for the week, and the 14-day contract rose a whopping 165 basis points. "The rise in the seven- and 14-day repos is because they cross the end of the month and the quarterly reporting period," said a trader a major state-owned bank in Shanghai. Short-term money markets continued to shrug off media reports of pending loosening of bank reserve requirement ratios, a rumour of which helped juice smaller bank stocks on Thursday afternoon. But traders were closely following recent plans by the central bank to reform the way it publishes pricing of money. [ID:nL4N0MM2ZA] The National Interbank Funding Center, which is controlled by the central bank, will use a new method to calculate the opening quote for the overnight <CN1DRP=CFXS> and seven-day <CN7DRP=CFXS> bond repurchase rates, four sources told Reuters. Rather than simply publishing the rate for the first trade, the center will use the so-called "call auction" method to calculate the official opening rate, which often serves as a key reference for pricing in the broader bond market. "With 50 banks quoting prices, the opening rate will be much more accurate to reflect market reality," said a dealer at a major state-owned bank in Shanghai. "The opening rate typically has a big influence on market sentiment of the day." The two-year interest rate swap <CNABAD2YF=> based on the 1-year deposit rate stood at 3.009 percent, indicating markets do not expect an interest rate cut either.  The five-year credit default swap rate on Chinese sovereign debt <CNGV5YUSAC=R> sunk this week to 96.09, down from 99.99 at the end of the previous week but remained in relatively elevated territory. Corporate bond yield spreads flattened but remained high as investors continue to price in the likelihood of more defaults by low-grade issuers.
