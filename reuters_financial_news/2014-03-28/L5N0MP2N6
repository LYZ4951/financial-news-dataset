MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Credito Valtellinese <PCVI.MI> said on Friday a consortium of nine banks and brokers would underwrite its upcoming rights issue worth up to 400 million euros ($549.6 million).

Banca Imi <ISP.MI>, Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> and Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> will lead the consortium for the cash call, which will have to be approved by the bank's shareholders on April 12. The rights issue would bring the lender's best-quality capital to 10.9 percent, above a minimum threshold of 8 percent set by the European Central Bank for euro zone lenders. Credito Valtellinese is one of 15 Italian banks targeted by the ECB's check-up.
