MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> rose up to 5 percent on Milan's bourse on Friday, the day after the company set the price for a planned capital increase.

"(The share move) is related to the capital increase," a Milan-based trader said, as the shares rose 4 percent on the day to be quoted at 17.5 euros ($24) at 1004 GMT, against a 1 percent rise in Italy's all-share index.
