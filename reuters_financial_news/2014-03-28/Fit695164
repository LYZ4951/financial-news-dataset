March 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded China-based watch  retailer Hengdeli Holdings Limited's <3389.HK> (Hengdeli) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) and senior unsecured rating to 'BB' from 'BB+'. The Outlook is Stable.   The downgrade reflects Hengdeli's deteriorating credit metrics amid a weak  operating environment. It will be challenging for Hengdeli to demonstrate a  sustained strong recovery to its previous level in the medium term.   The Stable Outlook reflects Hengdeli's ability to maintain its strong business  positioning and sufficient liquidity position despite the current down cycle.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak environment increases recovery uncertainties. China's overall weak consumer  sentiment and the government's anti-graft campaign in H213 continued to affect  Hengdeli's performance. The company's active reshuffling of its product mix to  fast-moving mid-range watches was not enough to offset the rapid decline in  high-end watches sales. The company's overall same-store-sales growth (SSSG) in  mainland China declined 7.1% in 2013 (H113: -7.5%) as high-end watch SSSG  contracted 18.5% (H113: -18.9%) while mid-range watch SSSG remained flat (+0.6%)  (H113: +0.6). Hengdeli's SSSG in mainland China and wholesale segment had  exhibited positive growth YTD Feb 2014. However, sales visibility of Hong Kong  operations remained weak. Fitch views uncertainties in the economic conditions  and the weak buying sentiment would continue to dampen Hengdeli's sales rebound  in the medium term.  Profitability Pressured by Slower Sales. Hengdeli's EBITDA margin narrowed to  8.32% in 2013 (2012: 11.51%) due to heavier sales discounting and increased  rental costs. Fitch estimated that one percentage point of decline was  attributed to margin dilution from its new Harvest Max business. Fitch expects  the company's EBITDA margin to demonstrate slight recovery to around 9%, which  is still lower than the previous level. A higher contribution from mid-segment  watches which yields stronger margins would improve Hengdeli's profitability in  2014, but this benefit would partially be offset by ongoing sales discounting. Acquisition and Working Capital Increased Leverage. Hengdeli's high inventory  days of 223 days (H113: 225 days) and about CNY300m of acquisition costs drove  higher FFO adjusted net leverage of 3.5x in 2013 (H113: 3x). With Hengdeli  finalising its inventory mix adjustments towards more fast moving mid-end  products by 2014, Fitch expects some alleviation in working capital with  positive free cash flow generation; the company's leverage would trend below 3x  over the next 12-18 months.  Strong business positioning. Despite a weaker performance, Hengdeli's rating is  still supported by its leading market position in the Swiss watch retail sector  in China, its established distribution network and exclusive watch distribution  arrangements that support its wholesale business. In 2013, the company was able  to lengthen its days payables with suppliers in light of the weaker environment,  which is a reflection of the company's business positioning and close  relationship with its suppliers.  Adequate Liquidity. Hengdeli maintains sufficient cash of CNY2.3bn to cover its  short-term bank loans of CNY1.35bn and estimated capital expenditure of around  CNY150m for the next 12 months. The company also has CNY2bn in unutilised  facilities to bridge working capital purposes, if required. As expected, the  company had redeemed most of its convertible bonds in 2013, with outstanding  balance of HKD95m as at end-2013.
