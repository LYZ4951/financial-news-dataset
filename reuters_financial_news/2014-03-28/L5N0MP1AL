MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Italian mid-tier lender Carige <CRGI.MI> said on Friday its core capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at a lowly 5.1 percent at the end of 2013, according to a presentation slide posted on its website.

The Genoa-based bank said that including an 800-million euro ($1.10 billion) capital increase the lender plans to carry out in June, the so-called Common Equity Tier 1 ratio would rise to 8.7 percent.
