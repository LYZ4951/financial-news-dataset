TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - Japan's Sekisui House Ltd <1928.T> is buying an office tower in central Tokyo for 74 billion yen ($720 million), as property prices rise to levels that allow lenders to recoup losses from a bust that followed the global financial crisis.

With this deal, expected to close by Monday, Tokyo's prime commercial property market is finally putting behind it an ill-fated series of highly leveraged investments that failed spectacularly when a 2006-2007 real estate boom went bust in the wake of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The Osaka-based home builder has agreed to buy the 20-storey, 41-year-old Akasaka Kokusai Building in an upscale commercial and business district, according to four people briefed on the deal.
