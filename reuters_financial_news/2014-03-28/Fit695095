March 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that the implementation of its  revised criteria (see 'Covered Bonds Rating Criteria', dated 10 March 2014 on  www.fitchratings.com) has no impact on the rating of Chilean mortgage bonds. There is no advanced bank resolution framework in Chile. Therefore, in Fitch's  view, in the case of Chile, the National Rating for senior unsecured issuances  remains a satisfactory indicator of the likelihood that the recourse against the  cover pool would be enforced, and no uplift is applicable. Fitch's Covered Bonds Rating Criteria was amended to reflect the beneficial  position of covered bonds under bank resolution frameworks where resolution  tools are in place including the bail-in of certain debt, from which covered  bonds are explicitly exempt. The amendment to the criteria is centered on an  uplift above the Issuer Default Rating, ranging from zero to three notches,  applied prior to the agency's discontinuity risk analysis.
