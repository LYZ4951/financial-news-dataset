MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Giuseppe Recchi, the frontrunner to become chairman of Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI>, told Reuters Italy's largest telecoms group by market value must behave as a true public company and vowed to represent all shareholders equally.

In an interview on Friday, Recchi, who will be leaving his current job of chairman of state-owned oil major Eni <ENI.MI> if elected by Telecom Italia shareholders on April 16, said he would be the garantor of good corporate governance practices, allowing CEO Marco Patuano to concentrate on strategy. "Telecom has to behave and act as a public company, because of the challenges in the industry and relevance for financial investors, in Italy and abroad," Recchi said. "Our intent is to create value in the interest of all shareholders. There are no different types of shareholders, in my view. There is only one category of shareholders, which is 'all' shareholders". The board of Telecom Italia, which has competitor Telefonica <TEF.MC> and three Italian financial institutions at its core shareholders, has been accused by investors led by Marco Fossati of not caring for the interest of smaller shareholders. The current board was almost overthrown at a cliffhanger shareholder meeting in December as investors protested against what they said was a lack of transparency and chronic share underperformance at the debt-laden group. To address these concerns, Telecom is pushing through a reform of its governance. Its core investors have drawn up a list of mostly independent board members led by Recchi. Telefonica and its three allies, Generali <GASI.MI>, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and Mediobanca <MDBI.MI>, are united in a shell company, called Telco, that owns 22.4 percent of Telecom Italia. The three financial investors have pledged to exit Telco, with Generali planning to leave it as early as June.
