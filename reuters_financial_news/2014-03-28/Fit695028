March 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating to Platinum Trust - November 2013's pass-through certificates (PTC) as follows:INR4,034.6m Series A PTC due December 2017: 'BBB-sf'; Stable Outlook The rating addresses timely payment of interest and principal in accordance with  the scheduled payout in the transaction document. The distribution tax will be  deducted from the scheduled payout before the income is distributed by the trust  to the PTC holders. The transaction document has specified that the variation in  the scheduled payouts on account of deductions for the distribution tax shall  not amount to any PTC event of default.  The transaction is a static securitisation of Indian rupee-denominated  commercial vehicle loans  originated by Cholamandalam Investment and Finance  Company Limited <CHLA.NS> (CIFCL), which is also the servicer.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating and outlook reflect adequate external credit enhancement (CE) of 9.5%  of the initial principal balance, CIFCL's origination practices, servicing  experience, and expertise in collection and recovery of commercial-vehicle loans  in India. The transaction is supported by a sound legal and financial structure.  The CE is cash collateral in the form of fixed deposits - with Axis Bank and  Canara Bank, both rated at 'BBB-' and 'F3' by Fitch - in the name of the  originator with a lien marked in favour of the trustee.   The credit enhancement is deemed sufficient to cover the commingling risk of the  servicer and the liquidity for the timely payment of PTCs. India's economic situation has been factored into Fitch's analysis. The 2012  vintage showed more delinquencies at 90 days past due than earlier and  subsequent vintages as a result of unfavourable economic conditions in 2012. The  agency has considered the heightened economic risks in India in its base-case  default-rate assumptions. The default rate, recovery rate and time to recovery,  together with the portfolio's weighted-average yield, were stressed in Fitch's  Asia-Pacific ABS cash flow model to assess the sufficiency of cash flow for  timely payment at the current rating level. Fitch has received the latest servicer report dated March 2014, and finds that  the delinquencies at 90 days past due have performed in line with other CIFCL's  transactions rated by Fitch, at the same level of seasoning.   No interest-rate or foreign-currency risks exist in the transaction, as both the  assets and the PTCs are fixed-rate and denominated in rupees. The collateral pool to be assigned to the trust at par had an aggregate  outstanding principal balance of INR4,035m and consisted of 15,587 loans as of  31 October 2013. The collateral pool had a weighted average (WA) loan-to-value  ratio of 82.9%, a WA seasoning of 14 months and a WA yield of 14.9%. Loans for  new commercial vehicles accounted for about 92% of the pool with the rest being  loans for used commercial vehicles. Loans that were 1-30 days past due accounted  for 10.3% of the pool, and 9.7% of the pool had overdue amounts valued at over  5% of the monthly instalment.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Based on Fitch's sensitivity analysis, the base-case default rate would need to  increase by at least 15% from the current rate, or the base-case recovery rate  to decline by at least by 26%, before a rating downgrade to BB+ would be  considered. The sensitivity analysis assumes that the CE and other factors  remain constant.   The rating could be upgraded if the ratings of both banks holding the cash  collateral are upgraded to above 'BBB-' and the portfolio performance remains  sound, with adequate CE that can withstand stress under a rating scenario of  above 'BBB-sf'. CIFCL has assign commercial vehicles loans to the trust, which in turn issued  the PTCs. The PTC proceeds were used to fund the purchase of the underlying  loans.  An appendix to the press release, describing the representations, warranties,  and enforcement mechanisms, has been published today. Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Platinum Trust - November 2013
