MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Italy's mid-sized bank Carige <CRGI.MI> posted on Friday a net loss of 1.76 billion euros ($2.42 billion) for last year after heavy writedowns on past acquisitions and bad loans.

The Genoa-based bank, considered by analysts to be one of the weakest among the 15 Italian lenders due to go before the European Central Bank for a health check later this year, wrote down by 94 percent the goodwill on past deals and took writedowns of around 1 billion euros on its lending.  The bank also said it has appointed a group of other banks to run its planned 800 million-euro share offer which it needs to boost its balance sheet. In its results statement on Friday, the bank said it was aiming for a Common Equity Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 11.5 percent of risk-weighted assets in 2018 but did not give a comparison with current levels.  The European Central Bank has set a minimum CET 1 capital ratio of 8 percent for euro zone banks. Carige's top shareholder, a cash-strapped foundation with strong ties to the city of Genoa, had long resisted a share issue, hoping Carige would be able to strengthen its capital base through asset sales.
