PRAGUE, March 28 (Reuters) - Czech Orco Property Group's <ORCO.PA> net loss deepened to 227 million euros in 2013 and revenues dropped sharply, the property developer said.

Losses widened from 41.9 million euros ($57.57 million) in 2012. Revenues dropped to 145.9 million euros from restated 244.7 million euros in 2012 due to major asset sale recorded in that year and not matched in 2013.
