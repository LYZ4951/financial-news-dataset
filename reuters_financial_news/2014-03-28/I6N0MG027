MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Shares in Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> rose 3 percent on Friday as the bank said it was on course to rebuild profits after a net loss of 4.55 billion euros ($6.25 billion) for last year due to heavy writedowns on bad loans and impairments on some units.

Italy's largest retail lender unveiled a new business plan in which it targeted strong profit growth over the next four years thanks to cost cuts, a greater focus on its private banking and asset management units and the sale of non-core assets.[nL5N0MP0ZZ]
