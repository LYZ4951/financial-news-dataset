MILAN, March 12 (Reuters) - Shares in Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> rose in early trade after the troubled bank posted better-than-expected core revenues and costs in 2013, even though it booked a bigger-than-forecast loss for the year.

The stock was up 3.4 percent at 0.23 euros by 0808 GMT, against a 1 percent rise in Italy's banking index <.FTIT8300>. Monte dei Paschi posted a loss of 1.44 billion euros for 2013 after big writedowns on bad loans as it sought to clean up its balance sheet ahead of a sector-wide health check by European regulators.
