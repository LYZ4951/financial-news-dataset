NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - LPL Financial Holdings <LPLA.O>, one of the fastest-growing U.S. broker-dealers, has terminated employment agreements for its top executives but sweetened some of their benefits and paid two of them $500,000 apiece for giving up the contracts.

The disclosures were made in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that also reported a 32 percent jump in compensation to $6.14 million for longtime LPL Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Casady and a 21 percent hike to $3.12 million for President Robert Moore in 2013.  LPL's decision to eliminate employment contracts for Casady, Moore and Chief Financial Officer Dan Arnold as of Feb. 24 had nothing to do with executive performance but was meant to align the firm "more closely with market practices" and eliminate compensation discrepancies with other executives, the proxy statement said. For agreeing to undo their contracts, Arnold and Moore were each granted a special restricted stock grant valued at $500,000.  The moves come as so-called independent broker-dealers such as LPL have been growing at breakneck speed even as they stumbled in supervising sales and compliance procedures.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last May imposed $9 million in fines and customer restitution against LPL for pervasive technology lapses that prevented it from monitoring the emails of the almost 14,000 brokers who buy compliance, marketing and product services from the company. On Wednesday, FINRA fined two other independent firms that compete with LPL - Triad Advisors and Securities America - $650,000 and $625,000 respectively for failing to supervise brokers who gave inaccurate account statements to customers. LPL and the two firms settled without admitting the allegations, but LPL has since increased up its technology and Casady has admitted to having sacrificed controls for growth in past years. His board of directors has not held it against him. In the company's proxy filing Tuesday, the compensation committee said Casady had exceeded his performance target "as the company continues to transform its operating model and related expenses." LPL's adjusted earnings of $259 million last year were above its $250 million plan, it said. An LPL spokeswoman did not respond to a query as to why the 53-year-old Casady, who has been with LPL since 2003, did not receive a stock grant. Last month, however, he was given new stock options worth $3.1 million that vest over three years, down from the five-year period LPL used to require for such bonuses.   SEVERANCE SWEETENED LPL's board also rewrote the company's severance plan so executives get higher immediate compensation if they are terminated for reasons such as takeovers. It also lowered the age at which executives can retire with immediate access to deferred benefits from age 65 to age 55 if they have worked at LPL for 10 years.   Though little known to the public, LPL's almost 14,000 brokers make it the fourth biggest broker-dealer in the U.S., slightly behind Bank of America's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch. It and other independent firms allow their brokers to keep much more of the fees and commission they earn from clients than traditional firms such as Merrill and Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, but the brokers at the independent firms pay for most of their overhead. Though independent broker-dealers have traditionally focused on brokers who sell insurance and other products to middle-class Americans, LPL in recent years has aimed at hiring higher-end brokers with clients who have more than $250,000 to invest or who service corporate retirement plans.   Since it operates on thin profit margins because so much revenue is kept by brokers, LPL depends on continually growing its franchise to increase fees and commissions. The company missed its hiring target in 2013 due to "an industry-wide slowdown" in recruiting in the first half of the year, the proxy statement said, though it credited Casady with keeping broker production levels high. In a presentation last week, however, the firm said recruiting in January and February remains below target due to "disruptive weather" conditions this winter.[ID:nL1N0M31UT]
