BRUSSELS, March 12 (Reuters) - The European Commission cleared on Wednesday an amended restructuring plan of Spain's Bank CEISS after its acquisition of Unicaja.

The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is the guardian of EU anti-trust laws and therefore has to give its approval mergers, acquisitions and government help granted to companies after making sure they do not impede competition. "The European Commission has concluded that an amendment to Banco CEISS' restructuring plan, following its recent acquisition by Unicaja Banco, was in line with EU state aid rules," the Commission said in a statement.
