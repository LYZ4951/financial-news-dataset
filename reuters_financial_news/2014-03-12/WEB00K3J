PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - Numericable <NUME.PA> Chief Executive Eric Denoyer said there was no need to sell assets in order to address competition issues as part of its bid to buy Vivendi's <VIV.PA> SFR and criticised a rival offer from Bouygues Telecom <BOUY.PA> as not credible.

"Our strategy is to build the best network and use it to grow - not on marrying two operators in decline just to wring out cost savings," Denoyer said. "There is no need for asset sale or concessions or anything." He added: "Our synergies can be put in place very quickly because they are network based. The synergies can come through as early as this year." Bouygues Telecom said on the weekend it had agreed to sell its mobile network and much of its spectrum to smaller rival Iliad <ILD.PA> as a way to head off competition regulators' concerns about its pending bid for SFR.
