FRANKFURT, March 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's policy toolbox includes non-standard measures that it is ready to use to achieve its mandate to deliver stable prices, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said on Wednesday.

"Economic uncertainty has increased. So, too, has our toolbox, which now also includes various non-standard measures - which we are ready to use to achieve our price stability mandate," Praet said in the text of remarks for delivery at a conference in Frankfurt. Praet said the ECB reinforced its forward guidance at its policy meeting last week "by adding a new element, which is the allusion to economic slack". ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference after the March 6 policy meeting that the bank's policy stance would stay in place "even after we see improvements in the economy" because of the slack.
