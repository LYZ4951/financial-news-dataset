March 12 (Reuters) - Pimco, home to the world's largest bond fund run by co-founder Bill Gross, upgraded its assessment on U.S. economic growth on Wednesday, saying it expects it to run between 2.5 percent and 3 percent in 2014, from 2.25 and 2.75 percent.

In its global economic outlook, Pimco said its baseline expectation for 2.5 percent to 3 percent real growth in the United States stems from "trends toward growth and spending in the consumer, corporate and public sectors." In December, Pacific Investment Management Co, better known as Pimco, said that the firm expected U.S. economic growth to run between 2.25 and 2.75 percent in 2014.
