MILAN, March 12 (Reuters) - Troubled Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> posted a higher than expected loss in 2013 at 1.44 billion euros ($2 billion) due to heavy writedowns on bad loans, it said on Wednesday.

Analysts had forecast on average a loss of 882 million euros, according to a consensus distributed by the bank.  The 2013 result compared with a loss of 3.17 billion euros in 2012 and was the third consecutive loss for the Siena-based lender, which was bailed out by the Italian government last year with 4.1 billion euros in state aid.
