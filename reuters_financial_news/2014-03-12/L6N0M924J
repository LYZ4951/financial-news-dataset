TEL AVIV, March 12 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Wednesday he wanted to impose travel restrictions on "prominent Russian MPs" as part of the European Union's response to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.

"We would be pushing for those travel bans to include some prominent Russian MPs," Cameron told reporters on a flight to Israel. "We had a meeting yesterday in London with partners about this and put that on the table." Political agreement would still need to be reached among the EU's 28 countries before any travel bans were imposed. A meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday presents one possible date when such restrictions could be agreed.
