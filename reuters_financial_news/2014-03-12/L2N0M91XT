RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 (Reuters) - Latin American stocks edged lower on Wednesday on persistent fears that China's economic slowdown would hurt demand for the region's commodities, although some mining shares rebounded on a belief that a recent sell-off was exaggerated.

Key Latin American currencies also posted light gains, stabilizing after a string of losses. Concerns about plunging metal prices, however, kept investors cautious. Prices of copper <CMCU3>, Chile's main export product, rebounded late on Wednesday after a sharp three-day sell-off, but further gains were capped by lingering uncertainty about China's demand for the metal. [ID:nL3N0M92FJ] "Copper's decline bodes poorly for the global economy," Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, said in a note to clients. "In context of the significantly weaker than expected February Chinese trade data, the dive in copper makes it seem like an economic slowdown is hitting China - and that's not good for anyone." * The Latin American portion of MSCI's benchmark stock index <.MILA00000PUS> was 0.2 percent lower, after dropping nearly 10 percent so far this year. * Brazil's Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> edged higher 0.2 percent as shares of mining company Vale SA <VALE5.SA>, which had dropped to an eight-month low in the previous session, rose more than 2 percent to 26.70 reais. * "A lot of people believe Vale's shares below 26 reais are worth buying, and those shares have fallen below that level today," said Luiz Roberto Monteiro, a trader with Renascença brokerage in São Paulo. * Mexico's IPC stock index <.MXX> was little changed, however, as key Wall Street indexes were in the red.  * Brazil's real <BRL=> climbed 0.4 percent after four sessions of losses. Investors wondered whether state-run oil company Petrobras <PETR4.SA> will convert into reais at least part of the $8.5 billion it raised on international capital markets earlier this week, potentially boosting the Brazilian currency. * Chile's peso <CLP=> rose 0.3 percent after closing on Tuesday at its lowest level in nearly five years on the back of falling copper prices.
