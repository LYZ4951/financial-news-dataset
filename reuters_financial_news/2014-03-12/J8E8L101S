PRETORIA, March 12 (Reuters) - South Africa's current account deficit narrowed more than expected in the final quarter of 2013 as exports outpaced imports to reduce the shortfall on the trade account in Africa's biggest economy.

The current account deficit was at 5.1 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a revised 6.4 percent shortfall in the third quarter, the South African Reserve Bank said in its Quarterly Bulletin on Wednesday. The bank said exports of cars and transport equipment picked up in the fourth quarter as manufacturers recovered from a strike in the previous three months. Portfolio inflows reversed in the fourth quarter. The financial account saw outflows totalling 30.8 billion rand ($2.85 billion), compared with 48.8 billion rand of inflows in the third quarter. However other investment flows switched from outflows to inflows in the last three months of the year, the bank said. On an annual basis the current account deficit was wider than in 2012. Import inflation saw South Africa's terms of trade - the ratio of export prices to import prices - deteriorate in the fourth quarter, the third consecutive quarterly fall.
