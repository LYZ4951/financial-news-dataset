NAIROBI, March 12 (Reuters) - Kenya's CIC Insurance <CIC.NR> plans to issue bonus shares, increase its share capital and expand its business to Malawi this year after reporting a marginal rise in full-year pretax profit.

The insurer, in which Co-operative Bank <COOP.NR> is the single largest shareholder, said in a statement that it plans to double its share capital to 6 billion shillings ($69.52 million) and issue one bonus share for every five shares held. Pretax profit rose slightly to 1.67 billion shillings from 1.65 billion shillings a tear earlier, largely because of a modest rise in investment income against rising operating costs, commissions and claims. Investment income rose 7 percent to 1.7 billion shillings, while claims increased by 30 percent to 6 billion shillings and operating rose 20 percent to 2.4 billion shillings.
