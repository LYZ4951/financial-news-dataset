LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Ukraine's dollar bonds fell on Wednesday after Crimea said it would soon take ownership of Ukrainian state companies on its territory, fanning political and economic uncertainty.

Crimea, a southern Ukrainian region which is home to the Russian Black Sea fleet, will vote on Sunday on whether to join Russia [ID:nL6N0M927S]. Since pro-Russian separatists took control of the regional parliament almost two weeks ago, it has declared Crimea part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine's 2023 dollar bond <UA091760584=> fell 2.4 points from Tuesday's close to 80.25, according to Reuters data.
