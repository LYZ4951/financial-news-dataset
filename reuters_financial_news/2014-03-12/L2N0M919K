WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Jefferies LLC has agreed to pay $25 million to resolve U.S. criminal and civil probes into its mortgage bond trading, U.S. authorities said on Wednesday.

The U.S. Attorney's office in Connecticut said it had entered into a non-prosecution agreement over Jefferies trading in mortgage securities, including with funds created and funded through a government program.   The Securities and Exchange Commission also said it charged Jefferies, which is now part of Leucadia National Corp <LUK.N>, with failing to supervise its mortgage-backed securities desk during financial crisis. A federal jury on Friday found former Jefferies trader Jesse Litvak guilty of defrauding clients on mortgage bond trades made after the financial crisis.[id:nL1N0M41WI]
