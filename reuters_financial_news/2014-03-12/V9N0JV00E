VIENNA, March 12 (Reuters) - The Austrian government has approved a quick capital injection for ailing state lender Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL], Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger said on Wednesday, adding he did not know exactly how much the bank needed.

"Auditors have sent a warning letter. We need fresh capital for Hypo and relatively quickly. We have provided for this and got cabinet authorisation for it," he told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Hypo Alpe Adria, which has already got 4.8 billion euros ($6.66 billion) in state aid, said on Monday it may need more help quickly to close out its 2013 accounts and meet minimum capital standards, creating another headache for the government.
