WELLINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank delivered a long awaited rate rise on Thursday, the first by a central bank in a developed economy, and signalled it expects a steady tightening of policy over the next two years.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised its official cash rate (OCR), as expected, by 25 basis points from a record low 2.5 percent, where it had been held for three years. Sixteen of 17 economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise, with financial markets seeing a 98 percent chance of a rise <CSSY>. One analyst has forecast the first OCR rise in June. [NZ/POLL]   *************************************************************  KEY POINTS:  - RBNZ says will raise rates to keep future average inflation near 2 pct - RBNZ says scale, speed of rate rises will depend on future economic data, inflationary pressures - RBNZ forecasts 90 day bank bill <NZ90DBB=RNZL> at 3.3 pct in June, 4.0 pct in December, 4.8 pct in December 2015, 4.9 pct in March 2016 - RBNZ forecasts bill rate to be at 5.3 pct in March 2017 - RBNZ says high NZ dollar remain a headwind, current level unsustainable in the long run - RBNZ says export commodity prices remain very high, especially for dairy - RBNZ says expects trade-weighted NZ dollar to moderate only gradually in coming years, to weigh on output - RBNZ sees annual CPI at 1.9 pct by year end, rising to 2.1 pct by early 2016 - RBNZ sees GDP growth peaking at 3.5 pct in 2015 - RBNZ says LVR lending limits may be having a faster impact on house prices than previously thought - RBNZ says higher rates, easing migration, rising housing supply to reduct house market imbalance - RBNZ says construction costs moderating in Canterbury, rising in Auckland - RBNZ says export demand may slow if China sees financial disruption - To read the RBNZ statement click on [ID:nZZNN004F00].  COMMENTARY MICHAEL TURNER, STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS "It's a pretty upbeat statement. Even with the high currency and a slower housing market, they are still confident the rest of the economy is gaining momentum. The strength of dairy prices is clearly helping here. "It's a pretty punchy track they've given for bill rates. It suggests they will be hiking at more meetings than not this year. There could be another 100 to 125 basis points to come in 2014. Then again, their forecast for inflation is hardly frightening. They've not got it above 2 percent out to the forecast horizon."  MARKET REACTION- The New Zealand dollar <NZD=> rose to $0.8493 from $0.8474 before the rate decision. Interest rate futures <0#NBB:> fell up to six ticks. Financial markets had fully priced in a rate rise and expect 126 basis points of tightening over the next 12 months. <CSSY>  LINKS:   - For all New Zealand news and data, 3000 Xtra users can   click on <NEWZEALAND>  BACKGROUND   - The official cash rate has been held at a record low 2.5 percent since a 50 basis point cut in March 2011, following a devastating earthquake in the second biggest city, Christchurch. This is the longest period the OCR has been left unchanged since it was instituted in 1999.- Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in the year to Dec 31, the highest in nearly two years, driven by higher airfares, building and property costs, which offset cheaper food and fuel. [ID:nL3N0KU195] - Recent data has shown solid growth in retail sales, house prices at record levels, a lift in building consents, business and consumer sentiment at multi-year highs, but little change in the jobless rate. The economy is seen growing at an annual rate of at least 3 percent over the next couple of years. [NZ-ECI] <ECONNZ>  - The RBNZ imposed limits at the start of October on how much banks can lend for low deposit-high value mortgages in a bid to slow the rise in house prices. Latest data shows the amount of such lending has fallen sharply. - The trade-weighted New Zealand dollar <=NZD>, the RBNZ's preferred currency measure, is about 2.5 percent higher than the RBNZ forecast in its December monetary policy statement. - The government is keeping a tight rein on new spending and selling assets to meet a commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2015. The strict fiscal regime is seen as a constraint on the economy.  - NZ's key rate compares with Australia's 2.5 percent, 0-0.1 percent in Japan, 0.25 percent in the euro zone, and 0-0.25 percent in the United States.
