MILAN, March 12 (Reuters) - UBI Banca <UBI.MI> posted on Wednesday a higher-than-expected 2013 net profit of 250.8 million euros ($347.77 million) helped by higher revenues and changes in domestic tax rules that boosted its fourth-quarter result.

Analyst had expected Italy's fifth-largest bank by branches to post a full-year net profit of 132.2 million euros according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate. UBI had a 2012 net profit of 83 million euros. On an adjusted basis, the bank's net profit stood at 100 million euros last year, marginally up from a year earlier. Among Italy's top five banks, UBI is the first one so far to turn in a profit for 2013. Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI>, UniCredit <CRDI.MI> and Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> all ended last year with a loss. Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> will report results at the end of the month. UBI said it would propose paying a slightly higher dividend of 0.06 euros a share.
