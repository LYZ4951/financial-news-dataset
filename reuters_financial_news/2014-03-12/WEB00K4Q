VIENNA, March 12 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International's <RBIV.VI> 2013 profit met expectations, the Austrian lender said on Wednesday, a day after rival UniCredit Bank Austria <CRDI.MI> shocked markets with a big fourth-quarter loss due to a full writeoff of goodwill. [ID:nV9N0FA02L]

"The 2013 profit is in line with expectations and underscores our role as Austria's most profitable large bank," Chief Executive Karl Sevelda said in a statement conveyed by a spokeswoman. It was not more specific. RBI results are due on March 27. The market expects 2013 net profit of around 446 million euros ($619 million), according to Thomson Reuters data.
