HONG KONG, March 12 (Reuters) - Shares of ChinaVision Media Group Ltd <1060.HK> are set to open up 290 percent after China's largest e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding agreed to buy a controlling stake in the Hong Kong-listed television programme services supplier.

Shares of ChinaVision, which were suspended on Feb. 25 and resumed trading on Wednesday, are set to open at HK$2.50 per share, compared with its previous close of HK$0.64 per share.
