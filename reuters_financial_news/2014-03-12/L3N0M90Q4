SEOUL, March 12 (Reuters) - Seoul shares fell in early domestic trade Wednesday, touching a near-three week low as persisting worries about China's economic growth outlook cut appetites for riskier assets.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> was down 1.2 percent at 1,939.86 points as of 0215 GMT. The index earlier traded as low as 1,938.60, its weakest level since Feb. 20.  A sharper-than-expected slowdown in China would likely hurt earnings of major local manufacturers, as the world's second-largest economy is South Korea's biggest exports market.  "Investors have yet to shake their concerns about corporate debt default and shadow banking" in China, said E-Trade Investment analyst Choi Kwang-hyeok. Foreigners were net sellers of local stocks on Wednesday, and were on track for a third consecutive session of outflows. Shares of steelmakers and chemical producers were broadly lower as concern about China's economy continued to raise worries about companies' performance. Lotte Chemical Corp. <011170.KS> was down 4.7 percent while Hyundai Steel Co. <004020.KS> was off 2.8 percent. Worries about the global economic recovery also hurt shipbuilders. Shares of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. <042660.KS> were down 3.7 percent, while shares of Samsung Heavy Industries Co. <010140.KS> were 2.8 percent lower.  Decliners outnumbered advancers 649 to 138.
