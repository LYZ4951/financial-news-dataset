ROME, March 12 (Reuters) - Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> Chairman Alessandro Profumo said on Wednesday that he is not concerned about the nationality of possible investors in the troubled bank as long as they back a medium- to long-term recovery plan.

"I'd stop talking about the nationality of shareholders; I'd focus on the nationality of the bank," Profumo told reporters on the sidelines on of a conference in Rome. "I hope that they can be shareholders who believe in the project to relaunch the bank in the medium- to long-term."
