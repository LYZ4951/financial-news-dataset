LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - The Oversight Committee of the Bank of England's governing body has appointed lawyer Anthony Grabiner to lead an investigation into the role of central bank officials in relation to the possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates, the BoE said on Wednesday.

Last week, the BoE suspended an employee as part of an  internal review into whether staff turned a blind eye to signs of manipulation in the $5.3 trillion-a-day global market, for which London is the main hub. Grabiner is a London-based commercial lawyer who has been involved in high-profile litigation cases, the BoE said in a statement.
