LAGOS, March 12 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira currency <NGN=D1> firmed 0.1 percent against the US dollar on the interbank market on Wednesday, supported by greenback sales by two energy companies, traders said.

The naira closed at 164.80 to the dollar, firmer than 164.95 to the dollar it closed the previous day. A local unit of Royal Dutch Shell and the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) company sold an undisclosed amount of dollars to some lenders, boosting liquidity, traders said.  The naira has been trading around 164-165 to the U.S. currency in the last week, supported by direct intervention from the central bank. The local unit has recovered from as low as 169 last month, when the government shocked financial markets by suspending the Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi.
