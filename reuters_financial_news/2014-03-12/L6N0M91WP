WARSAW, March 12 (Reuters) - Polish law forbids insurer PZU <PZU.WA> from issuing the bonds it wants to use to raise funds for a planned higher dividend payout, financial watchdog KNF said on Wednesday.

State-controlled PZU, Eastern Europe's top insurer by market value, wanted to issue 3 billion zlotys ($985 million) in subordinated bonds to be able to raise its dividend payouts between 2013 and 2015.  However, according to the law, insurance firms cannot issue such debt, KNF said, without elaborating. "The insurance law in its current form does not allow us to agree to an issue of subordinated debt by an insurance company. You have to change the law first," state new agency PAP quoted KNF deputy head Wojciech Kwasniak as saying. PZU shares were down 2.6 percent by 1134 GMT, underperforming a 0.5 percent fall in Warsaw's blue-chip WIG20 index <.WIG20>. According to PZU's dividend policy, the firm aims to hand out between 50 and 100 percent of its profit, which in 2013 stood at 3.3 billion zlotys. The bond issue would have allowed the insurer, which has a market capitalisation of $12.3 billion, to raise the payouts above the 100 percent level. Last year, the group handed out almost 4.3 billion zlotys to shareholders, with 1.7 billion in the form of an interim dividend from the expected 2013 profits.
