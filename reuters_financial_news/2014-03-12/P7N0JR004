PRAGUE, March 12 (Reuters) - The first-ever annual price drop reported in Slovakia for February was mainly due to a slowdown in food prices but a long-term drop is not expected, the central bank (NBS) said on Thursday.

It said it expected prices will be growing again by the end of this year, which means that a loose definition of deflation as four quarters of year-on-year price decline will probably  not be met. Slovak prices fell 0.1 percent in both month-on-month and year-on-year terms in February, under the euro zone country's methodology. A harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) will be released on March 17.
