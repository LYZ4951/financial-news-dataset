FRANKFURT, March 12 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post reported a 7 percent rise in operating profit in fourth quarter, beating estimates, partly boosted by its parcel business and strong growth in its international courier Express division.

The world's No. 1 postal and logistics group by revenue posted fourth-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 885 million euros ($1.23 billion) compared with 827 million last year and revenue of 14.494 billion, down 0.6 percent. The average in a Reuters poll was for EBIT of 878 million euros and revenue of 14.783 billion. [ID:nL6N0M34Z7]
