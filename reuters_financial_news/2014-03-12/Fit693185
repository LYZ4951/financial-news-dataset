March 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Proposals for additional capital buffers by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced yesterday could strengthen the credit profiles of Russian banks, Fitch Ratings says. This is a positive step following last year's watering down of new Basel III capital ratio requirements. Under the new proposals, banks would be prevented from paying dividends if they  do not meet the additional buffers on top of the 5% core Tier 1 ratio  requirement. A capital conservation buffer would build up over four years, in  line with Basel III phase-in arrangements, rising from 0.625% in 2016 to 2.5% in  2019. Systemically important banks would also need to maintain an additional 1%  buffer, meaning that they would have to achieve a 6.625% ratio from 2016, rising  to 8.5% in 2019. The proposals do not make explicit what sanctions, if any, a  bank may face for breaching these minimum ratios, aside of the restriction on  dividend payments. The higher capital requirement could be positive for Viability Ratings over  time, as banks accumulate a larger safety cushion, more commensurate with the  relatively high operating risks in Russia. Capitalisation currently only  provides a moderate buffer at many banks. We expect rated banks to be able to address capital shortfalls between now and  2016 through retaining earnings, raising equity and, where necessary, reigning  in growth. But in some cases, in particular where core Tier 1 ratios are  currently below 6.625%, the new rules may require more careful capital  management. Among the top 50 banks by assets (a rough proxy for those likely to be  designated as systemically important) that publish capital ratios, VTB 24 [VTBRV.UL],  Sviaz-Bank, Trust, Novikombank [AKBNV.UL] and SMP-Bank were below the new threshold at  end-January 2014. We also believe that Russian Standard Bank [RUSBK.UL], which has not  published its core tier 1 ratio, would need to strengthen its capitalisation in  light of the new requirements.
