ROME, March 12 (Reuters) - The Italian government will examine a draft law on the settlement of billions of euros in unpaid bills owed to commercial suppliers and contractors by public sector bodies at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, government sources said.

The law will contain measures enabling companies to obtain payment through the state holding company Cassa dei Depositi e Prestiti and commercial banks, which would take on claims against the government in return for a limited fee.
