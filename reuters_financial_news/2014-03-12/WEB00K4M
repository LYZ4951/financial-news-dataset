FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, March 12 (Reuters) - German chemicals group Evonik <EVKn.DE> has dropped out of the race for German medical skin patch maker LTS Lohmann in a surprise twist in a turbulent sales auction, two people familiar with the deal said on Wednesday.

After showing initial interest in LTS Lohmann, Evonik had bowed out of the auction a few months ago, only to be asked back to the negotiating table before the Christmas holidays. Evonik now decided not to pursue its exclusive talks with LTS Lohmann's owners - Swiss drugmaker Novartis <NOVN.VX>, German billionaire Dietmar Hopp and German investment company BWK - any longer as the parties' views on valuation proved to be too far apart, the people said.
