KAMPALA, March 12 (Reuters) - - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> firmed slightly on Wednesday, helped by a central bank squeeze of local currency liquidity and dollar conversions by exporters looking to meet their mid-month tax obligations.

At 0934 GMT commercial banks quoted the currency of east Africa's third largest economy at 2,510/2,520, stronger than Tuesday's close of 2,515/2,525. "Corporates have tax obligations and those in the export sector are looking for shillings to meet these obligations," said Ahmed Kalule, trader at Bank of Africa. "This has pushed the shilling higher but it's likely to keep in a narrow range." Financial market analysts say the local currency remains vulnerable to losses from lingering market concerns over the possible impact of aid cuts by Western donors on inflows of hard currency. The World Bank and four European donors have withheld aid or loans totaling more than $118 million to protest the Uganda's enactment of a harsh new anti-homosexuality law, which punishes gay sex with jail terms of up to life. "Some support for the shilling is also coming from the central bank's mop up operation today," said Brenda Akumu, trader at KCB Uganda. She said Bank of Uganda on Wednesday issued a seven-day repo totaling 211 billion shillings ($83.83 million), taken at a weighted average rate of 11.5 percent.
