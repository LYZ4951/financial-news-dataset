LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Russia's credit default insurance costs rose to their highest in nearly two years on Wednesday as concerns grew about the impact of possible western sanctions on the country's already flagging economy.

The 5-year credit default swap rate rose 11 basis points from Tuesday's close to 248 bps, the highest since June 2012, according to Markit.
