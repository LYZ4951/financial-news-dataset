March 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed GAT ICO-FTVPO 1, a Spanish RMBS originated by Catalunya Banc [FROBNC.UL] (unrated), Banco Mare Nostrum [BMNOS.UL] (BB+/Negative/B) and Unnim Banc [CCMST.UL] (unrated). A full list of rating actions is at the end of this comment. The underlying pool comprises loans granted for the purchase of Viviendas de  Proteccion Oficial (VPO) properties. These properties are part of social housing  programmes (VPO programmes) and are sold below market price to low income  borrowers that meet certain eligibility criteria.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Asset Perfomance Over the past 12 months the asset performance has been broadly in line with  Fitch's Spanish index for VPO-backed RMBS. In fact, the pipeline of late stage  arrears (mortgages with at least three monthly instalments overdue) is reported  at 0.6% of the current pool, while gross defaults, defined as mortgages in  arrears for more than 12 months, stand at 0.4% of the initial pool. The  performance of the underlying assets is reflected in the revision of the Outlook  on the mezzanine and junior tranche to Stable.  Fitch believes the stable performance is mainly driven by the high average  seasoning (nearly 120 months) and low average current loan-to-value (LTV;  roughly 45%) ratio of the underlying mortgages. Fitch notes that 37% of the  borrowers receive government sponsorship in the form of partial subsidy to the  monthly instalments (up to 20% of both interest and principal). The agency  acknowledges that this mechanism constitutes a further incentive for the  borrowers to stay current on their mortgages. Therefore, we expect performance  to remain stable on future payment dates.  Sufficient Credit Enhancement The credit enhancement available to the rated notes has increased steadily since  closing as a result of amortisation of the underlying assets. The current  average annual payment rate is 13.7%. Fitch found that the credit enhancement  available to the notes is sufficient to withstand the rating stresses and has  therefore affirmed the ratings.  Subsidy Termination Fitch's analysis tested the potential termination of the government subsidy by  assigning a higher probability of default to subsidised loans. The analysis  showed that the available credit enhancement is sufficiently robust to withstand  this stress.  Sufficient Liquidity The transaction features a fully funded cash reserve available to cover interest  and principal shortfalls. Fitch found this facility to be sufficient to cover  any liquidity shortfalls in the event of servicer disruption.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A worsening of the Spanish macroeconomic environment, especially employment  conditions, or an abrupt shift of the underlying interest rates might jeopardise  the underlying borrowers' affordability. An increase in arrears, defaults and  losses beyond Fitch's assumptions would result in negative rating actions.
