June 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings  and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables  Trust (AMCAR) 2014-2:  --$197,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf'; --$391,110,000 class A-2-A/A-2-B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$264,240,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$91,830,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$113,980,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable; --$112,090,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable; --$29,750,000 class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Credit Quality: The 2014-2 pool displays relatively consistent credit  quality versus 2013 pools, with a 566 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. <FICO.N>  (FICO) score, and a 241 WA internal credit score. Extended term contracts  continue to account for the majority of the pool at 89.24%. New vehicles total  47.43% of the pool, consistent with prior AMCAR transactions.  Consistent Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay  structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is consistent with the prior  nine transactions. The reserve is 2% (non-declining), and initial  overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25%, growing to a target of 14.25% of the  outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount for the distributing  period). Of note, excess spread has decreased to one of the lowest levels seen  to date, at 8.59% per annum.  Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's managed  portfolio and securitizations declined to some of its lowest levels, given the  gradual economic recovery and stronger used vehicle values. Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc. 'BB+' with  a Positive Rating Outlook. GM has recorded positive corporate financial results  since 2010. Fitch assessed the potential impact of GM/ GM-affiliated brand  vehicle recalls in relation to this transaction; Fitch expects this to have  limited to no impact on the 2014-2 pool. Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates adequate  abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by historical  portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch  deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing this series. Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide  that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the timeliness of payments on  the securities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on  defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and  could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the  sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of AmeriCredit Automobile  Receivables Trust 2014-2 to increased losses over the life of the transaction.  Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays some sensitivity to  increased defaults and losses, with some classes showing potential downgrades of  up to two rating categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss)  scenario. Some classes of notes could experience downgrades of more than three  rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
