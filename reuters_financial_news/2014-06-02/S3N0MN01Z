STOCKHOLM, June 2 (Reuters) - Sweden needs to take more action to deal with high and rising levels of household debt, Central Bank Deputy Governor Per Jansson said on Monday.

"Capital-strengthening measures are good in that they make banks more robust should something bad happen," Jansson told reporters. "But we also will need to take measures that deal directly with the risks associated with household debt and there we haven't done so much."
