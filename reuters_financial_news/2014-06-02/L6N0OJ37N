LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - European private equity firms Montagu and Astorg said on Monday that they would buy French medical diagnostics company Sebia from private equity firm Cinven [CINV.UL] after entering into exclusive negotiations.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Les Echos newspaper said earlier on Monday that it was in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion), adding that the firms had beaten off competition from Swedish fund Nordic Capital to clinch the deal. [ID:nL6N0OJ34F]
