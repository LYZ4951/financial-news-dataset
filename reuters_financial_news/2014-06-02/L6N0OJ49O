ABU DHABI, June 2 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Tourism Development & Investment Company [ABDHTT.UL] (TDIC), which is building branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim in the emirate, narrowed its losses in 2013 as revenue rose.

The wholly state-owned company made a net loss of 1.13 billion dirhams ($307.7 million) in 2013 compared to a loss of 2.15 billion dirhams in the prior year, a bourse filing in London, where TDIC has debt instruments listed, said on Tuesday.
