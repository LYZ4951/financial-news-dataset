FRANKFURT, June 2 (Reuters) - The size of the European Central Bank's dormant government bond purchase programme stayed at 164.5 billion euros ($2.24 trillion) last week, the ECB said on Monday.

The ECB terminated its Securities Markets Programme (SMP) in September 2012, replacing it with an as yet unused plan called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).
