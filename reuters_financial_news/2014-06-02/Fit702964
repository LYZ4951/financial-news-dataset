June 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Poland-based Bank Zachodni WBK S.A.'s <BZW.WA> (BZ WBK), Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. The Outlook is Stable.  The agency has also upgraded the bank's National Long-term rating to 'AA-(pol)'  from 'A+(pol)'. The Viability Rating of BZ WBK was not affected by these rating  actions. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this  commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES: IDRS, SUPPORT AND NATIONAL RATING The rating actions follow Fitch's recent upgrade of BZ WBK's 70% parent Banco  Santander's <SAN.MC> (Santander, A-/Stable) Long-term IDR (for more details see 'Fitch  Upgrades Santander and BBVA to 'A-'; Stable Outlook' at www.fithchratings.com). Following the parent's upgrade, the IDRs, Support Rating and National Rating of  BZ WBK are now based on Fitch's view of a high probability that BZ WBK would be  supported, if required, by Banco Santander. Previously, the IDRs and National  Rating of BZ WBK were driven by the bank's intrinsic strength as reflected by  its Viability Rating (VR) of 'bbb'. Fitch believes that Poland is a  strategically important market for Santander and BZ WBK a strategically  important subsidiary for its parent. The Stable Outlook on BZ WBK's Long-Term IDR reflects that on Santander. A  further upgrade of Santander's Long-term IDR would most likely result in an  upgrade of BZ WBK's Long-term IDR and Support Rating, provided that the parent's  propensity to support BZ WBK remains strong.  A downgrade of Santander's IDRs or weakening of its propensity to support BZ WBK  would result in a downgrade of the subsidiary's Long-and Short-term IDRs.  However, any potential downgrade of the bank's Long-term IDR would be limited to  one notch due to the floor being provided by BZ WBK's VR of 'bbb'.   The rating actions are: Long-term foreign currency IDR: upgraded to 'BBB+' from 'BBB', Outlook Stable  Short-term foreign currency IDR: upgraded to 'F2' from 'F3' Viability Rating: unaffected at 'bbb' Support Rating: affirmed at '2' National Long-term rating: upgraded to 'AA-(pol)' from 'A+(pol)', Outlook Stable
