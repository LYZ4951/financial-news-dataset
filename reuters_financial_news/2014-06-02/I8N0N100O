MUMBAI, June 2 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose as much as 2 percent on Monday, heading for its biggest daily gain in three weeks, as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> surged after its quarterly earnings beat estimates while state-run banks rallied on hopes the government would consider selling some of its holdings.

The BSE index was up 1.9 percent at 0950 GMT, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> was higher 1.8 percent.
