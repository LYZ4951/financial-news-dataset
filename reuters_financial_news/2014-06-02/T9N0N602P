TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Japanese insurer Dai-ichi Life Co <8750.T> is considering the possibility of issuing shares to raise funds if it successfully concludes advanced talks to buy Protective Life Corp <PL.N> of the United States, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Dai-ichi Life, Japan's second-largest private-sector life insurer, is planning to fund half of the acquisition of the U.S. insurer - likely to be worth over $5 billion - from existing reserves, said the source, who was not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. The rest of the acquisition cost would come from funds raised externally, including a possible share issue, the course said.  The Japanese company plans to buy 100 percent of Birmingham, Alabama-based Protective Life, said the source.  Dai-ichi Life declined to comment.
