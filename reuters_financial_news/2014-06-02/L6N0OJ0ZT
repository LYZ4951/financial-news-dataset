MOSCOW, June 2 (Reuters) - Russian rail group Transcontainer <TRCN.MM> <TRCNq.L> reported on Monday an 18 percent rise in first-quarter net profit helped by lower costs, while the country's rail container transportation market grew 9 percent.

It expects the market to grow in mid single-digit percentage rates for the full year and said that increasing levels of competition in the container market may put operator tariffs under pressure.
