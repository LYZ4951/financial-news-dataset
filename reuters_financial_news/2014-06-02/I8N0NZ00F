MUMBAI, June 2 (Reuters) - Shares of India's Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> surged 4.5 percent in pre-open trading after the company's fourth-quarter profit beat analyst forecasts with a rise of 69 percent, helped by a steep gain in revenue from its infrastructure and heavy engineering businesses, and gain from a divestment.

Net profit from continuing operations was 27.23 billion rupees ($461 million) in January-March, up from 16.1 billion rupees a year earlier, L&T said in a statement on Friday. [ID:nL3N0OG2VU]
