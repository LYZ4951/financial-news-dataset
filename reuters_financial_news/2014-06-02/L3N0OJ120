HANOI, June 2 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian markets fell on Monday, but Thai shares bucked the trend to touch their highest intraday level since Nov. 7, following an optimistic rating by Moody's and on bargain-hunting at low levels.

"Investors bought shares of some bullish stocks that have bottomed out due to the military coup," said Sasima Hattakitnikorn, an analyst with Phillip Securities. Thai shares have been lifted by buying from domestic institutions and retail investors as the military government moved to restart public spending and make delayed subsidy payments to rice farmers. [ID:nL3N0OG1YX] Moody's on Monday affirmed Thailand's Baa1 sovereign rating, saying the country's fundamental credit strengths were strong enough to weather cyclical pressures on the economy and recurring bouts of political instability. [ID:nL3N0OJ0TM] Volume on the $383-billion market was solid, with 5.2 billion shares changing hands by Monday's break, compared to the five-day daily average of 7.4 billion, Reuters data showed. The index has surpassed its resistance level of 1,426 points and is likely to gain further to 1,480 points, Sasima added. Banking stocks led gains, with Siam Commercial Bank Pcl <SCB.BK> rising 3.14 percent while Kasikornbank Pcl <KBANK.BK> gained 3.2 percent. Shares in the Philippines <.PSI> ticked up 0.61 percent after having fallen a combined 2.1 percent in the past two sessions on weaker-than-expected economic growth data. [ID:nL3N0OE2A9] Other equities markets in the region fell, with Malaysia's stock index <.KLSE> losing 0.6 percent, and Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> dropping 0.87 percent on profit-taking after hitting a near-four-week high on Friday.  Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> was almost unchanged, and Indonesia's Jakarta SE Composite Index <.JKSE> edged down 0.28 percent.
