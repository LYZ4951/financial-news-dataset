TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Japanese insurer Dai-ichi Life Co <8750.T> said it was considering various fund-raising options to acquire a U.S. life insurance company, after a source said it was in advanced talks to buy Protective Life Corp <PL.N> of the United States.

The company said options included an issuance of new shares, confirming an earlier Reuters report, but added it had not made any decision on the matter.
