June 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long- and Short-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Geneva-based Banque de Commerce et de Placements SA (BCP) at 'BBB-' and 'F3', respectively. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed BCP's Viability Rating at 'bbb-'. The Rating Outlook on the  Long-term IDR is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this  rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs and VIABILITY RATING BCP's Long-term IDR is underpinned by its VR, which reflects the bank's  stand-alone profile. The bank's VR primarily takes into account BCP's trade  finance and correspondent banking activities, which are well-controlled but  nonetheless expose the bank to operational and emerging market credit risk.  Fitch believes that operational risk in trade finance transactions, even if  executed well, is relatively high and limits the VRs of even the strongest trade  finance banks to the 'BBB' range. BCP's sound track record in avoiding meaningful losses in its core business and  ability to quickly adapt its business model to often volatile and challenging  conditions in global trade finance are supportive of its VR, which is one of the  highest among trade finance peers. In addition, the VR reflects solid underlying profitability, short-term and  largely collateralised asset base and strong capitalisation. It also reflects  the bank's moderate size and some (albeit well-controlled) concentration risk.  BCP's credit exposure is largely to trade companies, both in developed and  emerging markets, and to banks in those countries. The bulk of credit exposure  is short-term and typically collateralised by goods or guarantees related to the  specific transactions. This mitigates concentration risk to a large extent. While credit quality in its core trade finance business remained sound in 2013,  BCP reported a large impairment charge related to a discounted bill of exchange  from a troubled Spanish corporate. As a result, the bank's impaired loans ratio  worsened to 1.35% at end-2013 (0.20% at end-2012) but continues to compare well  with peers. However, similar to peers, BCP's asset quality remains vulnerable to  individual credit events given its concentrated credit exposures.  BCP's balance sheet is largely funded by emerging market bank deposits and  corporate deposits from well-established trade finance relationships. While  Fitch considers the bank's funding profile to be concentrated, this is  acceptable in light of the short-term and liquid nature of BCP's asset base.  BCP's Basel III liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 100% at end-1Q14. BCP's capital ratios, since 1 January 2013 reported under Basel III, are solid  and compare well with peers. The bank has in the last decade more than trebled  its equity base (to CHF356m at end-2013 from CHF107m at end-2003), which has  allowed the bank to enter higher volume businesses such as oil and  petrochemicals. Given the large size of some of BCP's trade finance  transactions, the strong capital base helps mitigate any potential sizeable  operational or credit related losses.  While BCP's performance remained adequate in 2013, profitability suffered from  3% lower trade finance volumes (to CHF9.1bn in 2013) and a simultaneous shift to  lower margin commodities such as oil as well as a sizeable non-trade  finance-related impairment charge, accounting for a quarter of pre-impairment  profit.  In 2013, trade finance and correspondent banking revenue, accounting for around  70% of total revenue, was 14% lower yoy. Treasury revenue typically accounts for  a fifth or revenue and was 14% lower yoy due to sluggish volumes and  management's decision to exit high volume/low margin "momentum trading". BCP's  wealth management division (around 10% of revenue) performed better, reporting a  4% increase in revenue. Positively, operating expenses were well controlled and  fell by 5% yoy largely as a result of lower discretionary staff expenses.  Given continued suppressed trade volumes and volatility in a number of emerging  markets that are important for BCP (eg Russia, Turkey and Egypt), Fitch believes  that the operating environment will remain challenging for BCP in 2014. Still,  BCP benefits from adequate geographical diversification and a flexible and  relatively scalable business model and should be able to achieve satisfactory  returns from its core operations. Operating profit in 1Q14 was 8.5% higher yoy  underpinned by improving net interest (+9.8%) and net fee (+3.4%) income.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs and VIABILITY RATING  Given BCP's already high VR in the context of other trade finance banks, upside  ratings potential is very limited in the near term. BCP's ratings could,  however, benefit from a material revenue diversification arising from its wealth  management activities as well as maintenance of stable performance, sound asset  quality and strong capital levels. Downward ratings pressure would most likely arise from a material operational or  reputational loss or further significant deterioration in asset quality.  Inability to adjust its business model to increasing competition in trade  finance, eroding margins and franchise, could also lead to a downgrade. A  significant decrease in capital ratios driven by excessive balance sheet growth  would also put a downward pressure on the ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING BCP is 69%-owned by Turkish Karamehmet Family and 31%-owned by Yapi ve Kredi  Bankasi A.S. <YKBNK.IS> (YKB; 'BBB'/Stable), the latter jointly-owned by Koc Group and  UniCredit S.p.A. <CRDI.MI> (UCI; 'BBB+'/Negative). In Fitch's view, there is a limited  probability of support from YKB. BCP's Support Rating is sensitive to a change  in Fitch's assumption around the probability of support from YKB.  The rating actions are as follows:  Banque de Commerce et de Placements Long-term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F3' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-'
