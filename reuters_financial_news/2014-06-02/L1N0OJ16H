NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co. <WFC.N> on Monday expanded its wealth brokerage division in Michigan with three advisers from rival brokerage firm JP Morgan Chase & Co's <JPM.N> Private Client Service Group.

John Bueno, John Raetz and Noah Robinson moved to Wells Fargo after nearly 25 years with JP Morgan, where the three managed $1.5 billion in client assets and generated $5 million in annual production. Bueno, who has been an executive director with JP Morgan's investment division since 1993, said he moved to Wells Fargo because he believes its approach promotes close relationships between advisers and their clients. "At our former firm it was more of an institutional relationship," said Bueno.  He also said that Wells offered him a broader menu of mutual funds to offer his clients.  The new advisers will launch Wells Fargo's wealth brokerage services in Birmingham, Michigan, the banks' first in the greater Detroit area. "This enables us to open a new market," said Kevin Dailey, regional brokerage manager for Wells Fargo Advisors. "We don't have any stores or branches in southeast Michigan at all." JP Morgan did not immediately respond with comment on Bueno's departure, or the two advisers.
