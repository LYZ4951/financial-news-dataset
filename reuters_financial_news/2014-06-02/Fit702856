June 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Bupa Finance plc's [BUPALF.UL] (BF) planned issue of fixed-rate senior notes an expected senior unsecured rating of 'A-(EXP)'. The final rating for the bonds is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received by Fitch. The fixed-rate senior notes will be guaranteed by The British United Provident  Association Ltd [BUPAL.UL], BF's parent company. The bond will be used to pay back the  outstanding GBP300m acquisition financing facility negotiated in December 2013  as well as reduce drawings under bank loans.  The proposed issue will lengthen the company's debt maturity profile as it  refinances the short-dated acquisition bridge financing and improves liquidity  headroom under BF's bank facility, improving overall liquidity.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Structural Subordination Mitigated The bonds are rated in line with BF's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured rating of 'A-', as they will constitute direct, senior, and unsecured  obligations of BF. Unlike the 2016 senior notes and the bank debt, the planned bond will not be  guaranteed by any of the group's subsidiaries. Hence, Fitch will classify the  planned bond as subordinated to the 2016 senior notes and the bank debt, which  benefit from additional intermediate holding company guarantees, and to other  debt at operating company level. Nevertheless, we have aligned the senior bond rating with BF's 'A-' IDR as  prior-ranking debt/EBITDA is under 1x, well below Fitch's threshold of 2x-2.5x  for structural subordination. Furthermore, Fitch does not expect this ratio to  increase above 2x in the near future. Fitch expects that future debt will be  raised using the current structure (only guaranteed by parent company and not  subsidiaries) and that any further subordination would be temporary until the  existing GBP350m bond matures in 2016. This should result in the new bond and  the bank debt security structure being aligned.  Prospective Deleveraging Drives IDR Affirmation Fitch affirmed BF's IDR at 'A-' with a Stable Outlook on 30 May 2014, reflecting  Bupa Group's ability to operate successfully in a highly competitive market and  to develop its business model outside established markets. Following a period of  significant acquisitive growth, which has increased its size, scale, geographic  reach, and diversification of cash flows resulting in an improved business risk  profile, BF has, however, exhausted its financial headroom under the current  ratings.  Fitch expects weak credit metrics in 2014 as a result of the recent  acquisitions; however the Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that the group  will now focus on the integration of acquired assets and on delivering the  associated synergies and growth opportunities, which the agency believes carry  limited execution risks. As a result, Fitch expects BF's debt protection ratios  to restore headroom under the 'A-' rating within the next 12 to 18 months.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The bond's rating is sensitive to changes in BF's IDR and hence senior unsecured  rating.
