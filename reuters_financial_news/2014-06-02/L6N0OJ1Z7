BRUSSELS, June 2 (Reuters) - Swiss Bank UBS <UBSN.VX> is being investigated in Belgium for suspected money laundering, Belgian prosecutors said on Monday.

A judge had launched the investigation, which may or may not lead to criminal charges and a trial. "Nobody has been charged yet but an investigation into money laundering and organised crime has been started," a spokeswoman for Brussels prosecutors said without elaborating. UBS said it was not aware of the investigation and could not comment.
