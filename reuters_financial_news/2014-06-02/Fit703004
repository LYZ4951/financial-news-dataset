At closing, the issuer used the note proceeds to  purchase a EUR950m portfolio of secured and unsecured loans granted to French  small and medium enterprises and self-employed individuals.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's rating action reflects stable portfolio performance over the past 12  months. Loans in arrears for more than 90 days remain at 0.04% of the portfolio  and cumulative defaults as a percentage of the initial balance is approximately  2%. The portfolio remains granular, with the largest obligor representing 0.56%  of the portfolio balance.  Fitch has applied a rating cap to the class B notes, in line with its published  criteria, 'Criteria for Rating Caps in Structured Finance Transactions'  published in May 2014. Under the sequential and accelerated amortisation  scenarios, the class B notes could experience temporary interest shortfalls as  allowed by the transaction's documentation. The transaction is currently  amortising pro-rata according to its amortisation triggers.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
