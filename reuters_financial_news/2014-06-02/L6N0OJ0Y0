MADRID, June 2 (Reuters) - Spanish builder Metrovacesa is close to completing the sale of its 27 percent stake in French builder Gecina <GFCP.PA> for 1.8 billion euros ($2.46 billion) to two U.S. funds, Expansion reported on Monday, citing sources close to the deal.

Blackstone <BX.N> and Ivanhoe Cambridge, which already own 23 percent of Gecina, were looking at ways to avoid being legally obliged to launch a full takeover bid, including teaming up with a third partner, the paper said. Metrovacesa was taken over by creditor banks Santander <SAN.MC>, BBVA <BBVA.MC>, Sabadell <SABE.MC>, Bankia <BKIA.MC> and Popular <POP.MC> after failing to make debt payments in the wake of Spain's property crash in 2008.
