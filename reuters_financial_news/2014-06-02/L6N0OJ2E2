LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - Last week's European election results in France and Greece have negative implications for the countries' credit ratings because of their Eurosceptic tone, Moody's said on Monday,

The outcome in Italy, where Prime Minister Matteo Renzi strengthened his hand was deemed credit positive. "The European election outcome is credit negative for both France and Greece because the rise of Eurosceptic parties in those countries increases the downside risk that both governments may consider easing fiscal consolidation," Moody's said in a new report. It added that solid showing for Italy's centre-left Partito Democratico headed by Renzi had helped dispel concerns about his government, while the results were "credit neutral" for the other 25 EU countries.
