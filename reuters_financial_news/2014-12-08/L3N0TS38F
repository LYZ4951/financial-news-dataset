Recent outperformers also took a hit on a slew of worrisome global factors, including stronger-than-expected United States jobs data that raised the prospect of early U.S. rate hikes and a ratings downgrade for Italy.

"Today's fall was basically on tech stocks, especially on Infosys, and investors booked profits in banks. However, nothing fundamentally went wrong. Perhaps fundamentals are far more positive now. We expect more reforms to go through in this (parliament) session," said Deven Choksey, managing director, KR Choksey Securities. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> closed 1.19 percent lower at 28,119.40, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended down 1.17 percent at 8,438.25. Infosys shares led the losses.
