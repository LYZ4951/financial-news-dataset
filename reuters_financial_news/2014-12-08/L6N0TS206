COPENHAGEN, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Spar Nord <SPNO.CO> said on Monday it would be able to reduce total costs by between four and five percent if a planned takeover of local rival Norresundby Bank <NRSU.CO> is completed.

"Overall, Spar Nord expects that integration could produce synergies to the tune of 4 to 5 percent of the two banks' total costs, driven by operating cost savings as well as by a reduction of the two banks' headcount by about 4 percent," the bank said in a offering document on Monday. Staff cuts will be distributed across both banks and should be achieved primarily through attrition, the bank said. Spar Nord made a conditional tender offer for all shares in Norresundby Bank on Nov 10. [ID:nL6N0T03GP] Norresundby Bank shareholders are being offered two shares in Spar Nord and 309 Danish crowns for each Norresundby share, corresponding to 425 crowns per share and a total valuation of 1.955 billion Danish crowns ($322 million) for all shares in Norresundby Bank. By 1100 GMT shares in Norresundby Bank were down 0.6 percent at 399 crowns. Spar Nord controls 54.9 percent of all shares in Norresundby Bank but needs support from 90 percent or more of the approximately 23,000 primarily individual investors to complete the takeover.
