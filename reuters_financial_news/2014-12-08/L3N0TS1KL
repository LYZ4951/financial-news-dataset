TAIPEI, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Taiwan's finance minister said on Monday he opposed Malaysia's IOI Properties <IOIP.KL> seeking management control of the Taipei Financial Center as it was a national landmark.

The Malaysian company said on Friday it has agreed to buy a 37 percent stake in the center, which owns the Taipei 101 skyscraper, for 2.74 billion ringgit ($789.74 million) [ID:nL3N0TP3MJ].
