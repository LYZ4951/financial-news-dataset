LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Partnership Assurance Group <PA.L> on Monday said it had agreed a 206 million pound ($320.52 million) medically underwritten bulk annuity transaction with a pension scheme, the largest ever in the UK.

The deal will see the British company insure members of the scheme with the largest liabilities, who represent a disproportionate risk concentration for the scheme.
