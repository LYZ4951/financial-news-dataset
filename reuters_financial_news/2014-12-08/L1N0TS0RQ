MEXICO CITY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Sustained weakness in the peso could impede efforts to bring Mexican annual inflation close to three percent and potentially prompt higher interest rates, central bank governor Agustin Carstens was quoted as saying on Monday.

In an interview with Mexican newspaper El Universal, Carstens was asked to assess the central bank's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate earlier this year. The governor said the bank expected price pressures would cool in 2015.
