Dec 8 (Reuters) - Vanguard's top economists said on Monday they expect the global bond market to offer long-term returns of 2.0 to 3.5 percent as slowing growth in China and further monetary stimulus in Japan and Europe will likely keep interest rates low.

Their outlook on long-term returns for global equities, meanwhile, was in the 5 to 8 percent range. "After several years of suggesting that strong equity returns were possible despite a prolonged period of sub par economic growth, our medium-term outlook for global equities has become even more guarded," Vanguard Global Chief Economist Joe Davis and Senior Economist Roger Aliaga-Diaz wrote in their 2015 economic and investment outlook.
