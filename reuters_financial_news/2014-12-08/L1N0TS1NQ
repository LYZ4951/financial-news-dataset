Dec 8 (Reuters) - JH Partners has sold part of its ownership in jewelry company Alex & Ani, the private equity firm said on Monday.

San Francisco-based JH Partners, which acquired a 40 percent stake in 2012, sold half of its holding to British buyout firm Lion Capital LLP.   Reuters reported last week that Alex & Ani, which makes charm bracelets, could be valued for as much as $1 billion.
