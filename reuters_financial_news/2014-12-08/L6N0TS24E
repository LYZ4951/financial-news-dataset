LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring Ukrainian debt against default in the credit default swap (CDS) market rose to its highest level in five years on Monday, according to data from financial information firm Markit.

Ukraine's 5-year CDS rose to 1,794 basis points on Monday, compared with 1,732 on Friday. An International Monetary Fund mission will visit Kiev this week for talks with the new government regarding a $17 billion bailout programme agreed in April to shore up the ex-Soviet state's foreign currency reserves and support the economy.
