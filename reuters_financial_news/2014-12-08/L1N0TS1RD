NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Aircastle Ltd <AYR.N> Chief Executive Ron Wainshal said on Monday he expects Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus <AIR.PA> jetliner sales to be affected by a falling Russian ruble.

A weakening economy has impacted travel and airlines in Russia, paving the way for lessors such as Aircastle to ramp up direct purchases from Airbus and Boeing, Wainshal said in the interview. "There is an opportunity to acquire aircraft that otherwise would have gone into Russia," he said. "We have discussions with Airbus and Boeing all the time, (but) this might be just another reason for it."
