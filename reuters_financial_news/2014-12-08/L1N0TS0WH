NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Victims of Bernard Madoff's fraud may recover less money than they had hoped after a federal appeals court limited the ability of the trustee liquidating the swindler's firm to recoup "fictitious profits" and other transfers from customers.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Monday said federal bankruptcy law did now allow the trustee Irving Picard to recoup a variety of securities-related payments made to customers by Madoff's firm before it collapsed.
