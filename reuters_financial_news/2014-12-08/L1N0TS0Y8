NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday awarded $50 billion in term reverse repurchase agreements in the first of four weekly test operations in an effort to see how this tool might be used when it decides to tighten monetary policy.

The central bank will pay Wall Street dealers, money market funds, mortgage finance agencies and other qualified participants a "stopout" interest rate of 0.08 percent for these 28-day reverse repos due on Jan. 15, 2015, the Fed said via the New York Federal Reserve website. Bids submitted at the stopout rate were awarded about 92 percent of the amount submitted, it said. Seventy-one participants submitted $101.93 billion worth of bids with 40 of them receiving awards, the Fed said.
