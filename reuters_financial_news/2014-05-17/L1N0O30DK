CHICAGO, May 17 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc is set to announce its expected acquisition of top U.S. satellite TV operator DirecTV on Sunday, according to a report by online news website Buzzfeed.com.

A spokesman for AT&T said the firm would make no comment on the report. DirecTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AT&T has been in active discussions to buy DirecTV for nearly $50 billion, or low to mid-$90s per share, and has been working to finalize a deal in the next few weeks, Reuters reported last Monday. Citing a source close to DirecTV, Buzzfeed.com chief executive Mike White has told senior executives a deal had been reached and would be announced Sunday.
