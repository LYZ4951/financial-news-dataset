MANCHESTER, England, May 17 (Reuters) - Britain's Co-operative Group <42TE.L> voted unanimously on Saturday to accept proposals for far-reaching reforms designed to avoid a repeat of the near-catastrophic mistakes of recent years and secure the mutual's future.

Independent director Paul Myners drew up the proposals to change the governance of the 150-year-old supermarkets-to-funerals group, which lost control of its bank and slumped to a 2.5 billion pound ($4.2 billion) loss last year.
