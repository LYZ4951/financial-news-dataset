HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark share index reversed midday losses and finished higher on Tuesday, as strength in two leading technology firms outweighed weakness among financial stocks.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.2 percent at 24,689.41 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also rose 0.2 percent. Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> gained 0.8 percent ahead of its first-half earnings on Wednesday. Lenovo Group <0992.HK> climbed 3.6 percent to a more than 14-year high before announcement of its April-June results due on Thursday.
