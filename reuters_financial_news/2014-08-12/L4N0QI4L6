Bischoff oversaw the restructuring and return to profitability of Lloyds, which was rescued by the government through a 20 billion pound ($31 billion) bailout during the financial crisis. He stepped down four months ago. He would replace Tom Hoppe at JPMorgan Securities. During his career in the banking sector, spanning five decades, Bischoff worked at Schroders Plc <SDR.L> before its investment banking arm was acquired by Citigroup in 2000. He was chairman of Citi until stepping down in 2009 and joined Lloyds shortly afterwards.
