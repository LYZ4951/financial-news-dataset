KIEV, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The National Bank of Ukraine will keep intervening on the local foreign exchange market to prevent a "mood of panic" over the conflict in the country's east pressuring the hryvnia, its head Valeria Hontareva said on Tuesday.

Ukraine's hryvnia weakened to just off an all-time low against the dollar to 13.40 on Tuesday, in its biggest daily move since April. Hontareva said market concerns over the conflict in the country's east were to blame for the fall.
