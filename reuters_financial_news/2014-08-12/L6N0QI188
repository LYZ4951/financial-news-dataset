HELSINKI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Finnish financial holding company Sampo <SAMAS.HE> is expected to upgrade its 2014 profitability outlook for its property and casualty insurance arm helped by favourable business conditions in other Nordic countries.

Sampo, which is due to report its second-quarter results on Wednesday, owns the biggest Nordic property and casualty insurer If, as well as more than fifth of shares in both Nordea <NDA.ST>, the region's largest lender, and Topdanmark <TOP.CO>, a rival insurer from Denmark. Analysts have lately hiked their estimates for business and dividends due to encouraging signs from the Nordic insurance market.  If's biggest rival, Norwegian Tryg <TRYG.CO> last month reported a big improvement in its quarterly combined ratio, an important measure of profitability. [ID:nL6N0PL143] "The insurers have again succeeded in raising prices, and claims have been exceptionally low during the summer," said analyst Antti Saari from Pohjola Markets. In May, Sampo set a target range of 89-92 percent for its combined ratio for this year, and analysts in a Reuters poll expect it to be 88.6. Lower figure indicates better profitability.  "It is very likely they will change that range on Wednesday to a positive direction," Saari said. Sampo has raised its annual dividend every year since 2008, and analysts have also lately increased their forecasts on the following years' payout. The poll [ID:nL6N0QH2Y0] expects Sampo to pay out a dividend of 1.89 euros from 2014, 2.11 euros from 2015 and 2.25 euros from 2016. It paid 1.65 euros from last year. "Sampo has such large capital buffers and stable business that it can be looked at as a bond investment. Valuation is based on discounting rising dividends," Saari said. He has an "increase" rating on the stock with a target price of 42 euros, compared to 36.40 euros in Helsinki trading on Tuesday. Sampo has for years been sitting on cash made in successful M&A steps: it sold its banking business to Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> for 4 billion euros just before the financial crash, then bought Nordea shares from low price levels of 2008 and 2009. "For Sampo it seems important that investors can count on the dividend not being cut even during tougher times," Saari said.
