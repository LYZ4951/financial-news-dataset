DUBAI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] has agreed a $425 million loan from a group of banks to fund the acquisition of two Airbus <AIR.PA> A380 superjumbos, one of the lenders said on Tuesday.

Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD> (ADIB), Commercial Bank of Dubai <CBD.DU> and Dubai Islamic Bank <DISB.DU> were joint bookrunners and lead arrangers for the sharia-compliant financing, ADIB said in a statement. Emirates used the loan to take delivery of its 50th superjumbo, the bank said. The Dubai-based carrier is the world's largest operator of the A380 jets. In November, it announced plans to buy another 50 from the European planemaker at the Dubai Air Show.
