OSLO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Offshore oil services firm Aker Solutions <AKSO.OL> will rent three new office buildings in Aberdeen from its top owner Aker ASA <AKER.OL>, starting in 2015, the two Norwegian companies announced on Tuesday.

The 20-year contract, with further options for up to 15 years, is "part of an expansion in the UK", Aker Solutions said in a statement. The contract is for three interconnected buildings with a total space of 31,100 square meters and an initial rent of 7.74 million pounds per year, Aker ASA said in a separate statement. "While the rental agreement does not qualify as a related-party transaction, Aker ASA's ownership interests ... prompted Aker Solutions and Aker ASA to handle the transaction according to each company's internal guidelines for related-party transactions," Aker Solutions said.
