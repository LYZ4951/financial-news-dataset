COPENHAGEN, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Pension fund ATP, Denmark's largest asset manager with total assets of 618 billion Danish crowns($111 bln), decided to change its interest rate guarantee system to "better safeguard purchasing power", it said in a press release on Tuesday.

Starting January 2015 the guaranteed return on new ATP contributions will be set for 15 years at a time. Under the current rules, a lifelong guaranteed return is fixed at the time of the contributions being made. "The purpose of the current adjustment is to better safeguard the purchasing power of pensions, while taking the lower liquidity in the financial markets into account," ATP's chief executive Carsten Stendevad said in the release.
