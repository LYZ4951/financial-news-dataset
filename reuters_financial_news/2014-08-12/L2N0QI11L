Aug 12 (Reuters) - CoScentrix is recalling about 126,000 scented candles because the high flame can ignite the wax surface and container coating, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday.

The Carson, California, company has received two reports of the candle's surface igniting and one report of minor property damage, the commission said in a statement on its website. CoScentrix is recalling DD branded candles in 35 fragrances and colors of wax in round metal tins, it said. The candles were sold at Hobby Lobby stores and online at HobbyLobby.com from June through July for about $6. The candles were manufactured in the United States, the statement said.
