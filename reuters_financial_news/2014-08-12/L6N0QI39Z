SOFIA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Bulgarian prosecutors said on Tuesday they have charged the main owner of Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, Tsvetan Vassilev, with embezzlement and said there was an international warrant out for his arrest.

The bank was hit by a run on deposits in June that led to a banking crisis in Bulgaria. It has remained shut since then. Vassilev was accused of asking two employees at the troubled lender to withdraw 206 million levs ($140 million) from the bank between 2011-2014.
