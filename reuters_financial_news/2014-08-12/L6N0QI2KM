NAIROBI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Kenya's NIC Bank <NIC.NR> said on Tuesday it had received regulatory approval to issue 8 billion shillings ($91.06 million) worth of bonds to fund its expansion plans.

The lender, which also operates in neighbouring markets such as Tanzania, wants to use the funds to increase its capital base in order to boost personal and business loans. "We expect to be in the market with the first tranche this month," John Gachora, NIC's chief executive, said in a statement, adding the notes will be issued over five years.
