MUMBAI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Indian state-run lender IDBI Bank Ltd <IDBI.NS> said on Tuesday it is not being investigated by the country's top crime fighting agency over a loan to the now-grounded carrier Kingfisher Airlines Ltd <KING.NS>.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has launched an initial probe over the loan against both companies, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Saturday. [ID:nL4N0QF0B4] "The preliminary enquiry initiated by CBI a few months ago is against the borrower...and not against IDBI Bank, as reported in the media," the lender said in a stock exchange filing.
