HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - China shares edged lower on Tuesday, as cautious investors awaited more July data for fresh clues on how well the world's second largest economy is faring.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> slipped 0.1 percent from its eight-month closing high on Monday and ended at 2,221.59 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings eased 0.4 percent. Yonghui Superstores <601933.SS> was the top index boost in Shanghai, soaring the maximum allowed 10 percent on a share-purchase plan by a unit of Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd <DAIR.SI>. Tech shares outperformed, as analysts said some investors are going back to growth stocks in search of higher returns.  Beijing Teamsun Technology <600410.SS> jumped the daily limit of 10 percent and Yonyou Software <600588.SS> 6.1 percent, lifted by expanding efforts by the Chinese government to limit use of foreign technology.
