Zhejiang province is the seventh local government to issue municipal bonds. Late in May, the Ministry of Finance said 10 local governments had been given quotas to issue a combined 109.2 billion yuan of municipal bonds this year.

Governments in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, Qingdao, Ningxia and Jiangxi are included in the pilot scheme. [ID:nL3N0O710I]
