Aug 12 (Reuters) - The bankrupt Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, is set to close by September after failing to find a buyer, the casino said in a statement on Tuesday.

Revel filed for bankruptcy in June and received court approval to borrow $23.9 million in an effort to keep its 1,400-room resort operating for another month while it searched for a new owner.
