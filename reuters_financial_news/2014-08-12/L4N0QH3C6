HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - China shares weakened on Tuesday after the previous day's strong gains, as cautious investors awaited more July data for fresh clues on how well the world's second largest ecoomy is recovering.

Hong Kong shares also underperformed regional markets with some profit-taking on Chinese financials following Monday's rebound. At midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> had inched 0.1 percent lower to 24,615.06 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong also slipped 0.1 percent.

China's fiscal expenditure grew 9.6 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with a rise of 26.1 percent in June, the finance ministry said on Monday, indicating the government is slowing budget spending as the economy shows signs of stabilising.
