WELLINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices fell for a third month in a row in July, while the number of houses sold rose, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Tuesday.

The REINZ said the market was reflecting the usual muted activity in the winter season, while central bank limits on low deposit home loans, as well as rising interest rates were also being felt. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has said the state of the housing market will be a factor in when it resumes raising interest rates. It raised its cash rate to 3.5 percent last month but said it would then pause to assess the impact of policy, the strength of data, and level of the currency.  --------------------------------------------------------------- House price index (in pct): MonthPvs month   12 months  NZ total -0.7   -0.3+5.9   Auckland +0.7   +1.6   +12.2  Christchurch +3.5   -1.9   +13.9  MonthPvs month   Vs yr ago   Houses sold  5,893 5,763  -13.0 pct  Days to sell3739 35  ------------------------------------------------------------
