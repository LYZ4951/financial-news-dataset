LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi <SASY.PA> has cut pricing and extended the maturity of an existing 7 billion euro ($9.51 billion)syndicated credit line, the company said in an email on Friday.

AA/A1 rated Sanofi has joined other highly-rated European companies such as French utility EDF <EDF.PA> and German consumer goods maker Henkel <HNKG_p.DE> to take advantage of competitive loan market conditions to amend and extend existing credit facilities to lower pricing and lock in liquidity over a longer period of time. Sanofi extended the maturity of its financing, the majority of which was due to mature in July 2017, to December 2018 and restated two one-year extension options. The facility, which does not contain financial covenants or rating grid, has been repriced in line with current market conditions, the company said.  Pricing is likely to have come down considerably from the 45 basis points (bps) agreed on the original deal in 2010, banking sources said.
