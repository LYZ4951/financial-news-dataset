LAGOS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Nigerian interbank lending rates rose marginally this week to an average of 10.50 percent due to a large cash withdrawal by state energy firm NNPC and after the central bank debited banks' cash reserves requirement (CRR).

NNPC supplies the bulk of dollars traded on the interbank market. It sold around $400 million to banks last week, traders said, and deposited the naira proceeds in its account with the central bank on Friday.  Traders said the central bank also debited the CRR for the previous month from banks' accounts on Wednesday, reducing liquidity in the system and pushing up interbank borrowing costs. The average interbank lending rate rose from 10.33 percent last week. Banks' balance with the central bank declined to around 530 billion naira ($3.33 billion) on Friday, against 1.06 trillion naira last week. Liquidity in the banking system was boosted by an injection of cash from AMCON. AMCON, Nigeria's "bad bank", last week retired a portion of its three-year bond issued in the wake of the banking crisis in Africa's second-biggest economy in 2011. The open buyback was unchanged at 10.25 percent, 1.75 percentage points below the central bank's 12 percent benchmark rate.  However, the overnight placement rate inched up to 10.50 percent from 10.25 percent, while the call money rate rose to 10.75 percent against 10.50 percent last week. "We see lending rates inching up to around 11 percent next week because of anticipation of additional cash withdrawal by the NNPC next week, planned bond issuance and continued sales of open market operation (OMO) treasury bills by the central bank," one dealer said.
