Jan 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Caisse Nationale des  Autoroutes' [CNDA.UL] (CNA) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) at 'AA+' with a Stable Outlook, and its Short-term foreign currency IDR  at 'F1+'. Under its rating of public-sector entities criteria, Fitch classifies CNA as a  dependent public-sector entity of the state of France (AA+/Stable/F1+). The  ratings of CNA are aligned with those of the State since CNA, as a state  administrative public agency (EPA), benefits from a statutory solvency guarantee  from the State. As an EPA, CNA cannot be liquidated or go bankrupt, and is  allowed to receive State emergency funding. Also, the control of the State over  CNA is strong.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  CNA benefits from an implicit state guarantee since the law of 16 July 1980  renders the State ultimately liable for its EPAs' debts. CNA can access state  emergency financial support mechanisms such as emergency loans or the purchase  of CNA bonds by the Ministry of Finance. There are no caps on the latter, which  only requires agreement from the Minister of Finance. CNA has no equity and its  liabilities are modest compared with the state's funding capacity.  The State exercises direct control over CNA as most board members are civil  servants. As an EPA, CNA follows public accounting rules and is audited by  sponsor ministries or the National Court of Accounts. CNA mainly acts as a debt-amortising structure for debt previously incurred on  behalf of motorway concessions companies (MCCs) until 2006. The privatisation of  the main MCCs from 2001 to 2006 has made them ineligible for public funding. CNA  still provides funding to small state-owned MCCs, such as tunnel operators ATMB  and SFTRF. In 2013, CNA issued a EUR147m bond and signed a EUR120m multi-year  funding agreement with the European Investment Bank. Financial covenants between  CNA and MCCs are in place to ensure MCCs' loan repayment capabilities. MCCs' net  debt should not exceed 7x their EBITDA and their EBITDA should cover at least  2.2x financial charges. Debt decreased to EUR9.1bn at end-2013 from EUR10.3bn in 2012. The amortisation  schedule is smooth, with debt stock falling under EUR0.7bn in 2018 and to zero  in 2027. Debt taken on behalf of private MCCs accounted for 85% of CNA's total  debt at mid-2013. MCCs benefit from a rather diversified user base and a predictable regulatory  framework. Despite low economic growth, high fuel prices and a slight decrease  in traffic (-0.7% in 2012), total revenue grew by 4.3% in 2012, above the  2008-2012 average annual growth of 3.8%. Total MCCs debt stabilised in 2012 at  EUR31bn. Capital expenditure (EUR1.77bn in 2012) is mainly focused on  maintenance, as the French motorway network is almost complete. CNA's day-to-day administration and financial management, which are under the  control of CNA's Board of Directors, have been subcontracted to Caisse des  Depots et Consignations [CDCEC.UL] (CDC, AA+/Stable/F1+). CNA operating costs mainly  consist of CDC management fees and interest charges, and are fully matched by  mandatory contributions from all MCCs.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
