NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Citigroup's head of European spot foreign exchange trading, Rohan Ramchandani, has left the global bank, a spokesperson told Reuters on Friday.

At that time, the source said Ramchandani had not been suspended, nor was he accused of any wrongdoing and remained a full-time employee of Citigroup <C.N>.
