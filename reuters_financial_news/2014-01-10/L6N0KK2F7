COPENHAGEN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Denmark will likely take an exemption to new liquidity rules on covered bonds backed by mortgages if the European Commission tightens rules in line with a recommendation from the European Banking Authority (EBA), the central bank said on Friday.

Under proposed new banking rules aimed at strengthening the financial sector, European lenders will have to hold a so-called liquidity buffer made up of top quality assets akin to cash, such as government bonds, that can be sold easily.The EBA, however, has recommended to the EU Commission that Danish covered bonds should not be bracketed in the top tier of assets, a potential blow to Europe's second biggest covered bond market. "The national bank expects that Danish covered bonds will be classified as highly liquid in the European liquidity rules," the central bank said in a statement.  "If necessary, Denmark will likely be able to apply an exemption ... (so) it is the Danish Central Bank's conclusion that Denmark will get the opportunity to use covered bonds in full, either though being classified as extremely liquid assets or by use of the exception rule," it said. Under the proposed limitation, banks would only be able to use covered bonds to cover up to 40 percent of the liquidity requirement instead of 100 percent as is the case with government bonds. Danish minister for Economical Affairs, Margrethe Vestager, said it would be wrong if Danish banks could no longer fully use covered bonds to meet their liquidity requirement. "We continue our efforts to explain to the other EU countries and to the Commission that Danish covered bonds are extremely liquid assets," she said in a statement to Reuters. The Danish covered bond market totalled 2,731 billion crowns ($500.37 billion) in October, of which Danish banks used 932 billion crowns to meet their liquidity requirement.
