PARIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The French economy rebounded in the final quarter of the year with growth of 0.5 percent from the previous three months, the central bank estimated on Friday.

If confirmed, that would mark a strong pick-up from the third quarter when the euro zone's second-biggest economy contracted 0.1 percent. The INSEE official statistics agency is due to give its preliminary growth reading on Feb. 14, but it estimated last month that the economy grew 0.4 percent in final quarter. The Bank of France gave its third and final estimate for fourth-quarter growth, which was unchanged from the previous projection, in its monthly business survey.
