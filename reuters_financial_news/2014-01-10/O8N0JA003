OTTAWA, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The Canadian government is not actively considering relaxing foreign ownership limits on the telecoms and broadcast sectors, Industry Minister James Moore told Reuters on Friday, even though he has said he is open to the idea.

Moore said he was focused instead on upcoming auctions of wireless spectrum and legislation to cap wholesale wireless roaming rates that companies can charge each other. He will introduce that legislation "soon", in the spring of 2014, he said.
