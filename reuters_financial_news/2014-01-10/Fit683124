Jan 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has withdrawn the expected  'BB(EXP)' rating on Bashneft Capital S.A.'s proposed USD-denominated loan  participation notes (LPNs).   KEY RATING DRIVER Fitch had assigned the expected rating in June 2013. The rating has been  withdrawn as Bashneft has decided not to proceed with the issue at this time. The proceeds from LPNs were intended to finance a loan to Joint Stock Oil  Company Bashneft <BANE.MM> (Bashneft, BB/Positive).  Bashneft is a second-tier Russian oil producer that accounts for 3% of oil  production and 8% of oil refining in the country, with assets located mainly in  the Republic of Bashkiria. In 9M13 its crude production averaged 318,000 barrels  per day, up 3% yoy. Bashneft is currently developing the Trebs and Titov oil  fields in the north of Russia in a joint venture with OAO LUKOIL <LKOH.MM> (BBB/Stable),  which should help the company to diversify its upstream geography and balance  its upstream and downstream operations.
