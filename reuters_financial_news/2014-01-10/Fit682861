Three of 17 Fitch-rated Asia-Pacific sovereigns are on Negative Outlook, with the rest on Stable Outlook, Fitch Ratings says today in a report, "Asia-Pacific Sovereign Overview January 2014". The Stable Outlooks for most of the sovereigns illustrate Fitch's view that the region can weather foreseeable pressures in 2014, including China's rebalancing and Fed  tapering without systemic stress. Fitch's Asia-Pacific Sovereign Overview provides summary credit views on all 17  Fitch-rated sovereigns in the region. An accompanying report, "2014 Outlook:  Emerging Asia Sovereigns" looks at regional themes affecting the nine  Fitch-rated emerging market sovereigns.
