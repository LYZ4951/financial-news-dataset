LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Manchester United <MANU.N> received some welcome relief from the English soccer champions' on-pitch woes with the announcement on Friday of a sponsorship deal with Italian spirits brand Aperol.

United's latest commercial partnership was signed after a dismal start to the year extended to a third successive defeat, with a tough battle in prospect as it fights to secure a spot in the lucrative UEFA Champions League for next season.

"With the club widely recognised as the most supported in the world, this is a partnership that will deliver brand exposure on a massive scale," said Bob Kunze-Concewitz, CEO of Campari <CPRI.MI>, which has owned Aperol since 2003. Commercial terms of the deal, which runs until the end of the 2016/17 season, were not disclosed. Aperol will be able to advertise the brand at United's Old Trafford stadium and offer its Aperol Spritz drink to fans in hospitality areas.
