SHANGHAI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China's money rates slid steadily this week even though the central bank continued to hold off on injecting cash through open market operations, which dealers attributed to a temporarily relaxation of liquidity conditions as demand for cash eased.

The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day repo rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> declined by nearly 70 basis points this week to 4.03 percent on Friday afternoon, and other popular traded tenors also declined. However, dealers remain uneasy over the potential impact the relaunch of initial public offerings (IPOs) and the coming Lunar New Year holiday week will have on money rates toward the end of the month, and this has put upward pressure on interest rate swaps. "New IPO issues are a worrying factor. Nobody knows how big the impact will be, but it's in the background," said a trader at a state-owned bank in Shanghai. Dealers' concerns are technical in nature, related to the way IPO subscriptions are handled. In most cases, subscription funds for IPOs are put in escrow for a short period of time prior to the actual listing on the exchange.  When IPOs are very large - such as the pending one of Shaanxi Coal, which aims to raise 9.8 billion yuan ($1.62 billion) - they can put major pressure on short-term cash supply, pumping up short-term rates. That, combined with signs the central bank is willing to tolerate frequent spikes in short-term rates in the service of getting shadow banking under control, has dealers speculating another crunch may come in late January. Spikes occurred in June, October and December. Five-year default swaps <CNGV5YUSAC=R> in China are trading at nearly 90 basis points, their highest since September, and have risen by 20 bps during the past three weeks.
