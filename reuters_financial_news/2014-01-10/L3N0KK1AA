Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department plans additional enforcement actions against banks that do not have enough safeguards against money laundering, the acting head of the department's criminal division said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal.

"I think (banks) still need to do more," said Mythili Raman, the acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. "There's more (enforcement actions) to come, and that suggests to me that there are still banks that haven't gotten the message."
