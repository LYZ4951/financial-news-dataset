NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Beauty brand E.l.f cosmetics is in late-stage talks to be acquired by TPG Growth, the middle-market investment arm of private equity firm TPG Capital LP, according to three people familiar with the matter.

E.l.f, which stands for eyes, lips and face, could fetch $200 million to $300 million in a sale, two of the people said on Friday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. The brand had hired investment bank Financo to advise on a sale. Private equity firm TSG Consumer Partners holds a minority stake in the brand.  E.l.f, TSG and TPG declined to comment.  E.l.f. sells affordable cosmetics at retailers like Target Corp <TGT.N>. The brand's lipstick and mascara cost around $3 each.  L'Oreal SA <OREP.PA> previously looked at buying E.l.f but decided to acquire makeup brand Urban Decay instead last year, the sources said.
