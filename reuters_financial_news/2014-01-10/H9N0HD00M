HONG KONG, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares inched higher at the end of an anemic week, as a rebound in local and China property developers offset weakness among Chinese brokerages after a media report said a company was pressured to delay its mainland listing plans.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended up 0.3 percent on Friday and 0.1 percent this week at 22,846.3 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong inched up 0.1 percent on the day, but sank 2.6 percent on the week. [ID:nL3N0KK18B]
