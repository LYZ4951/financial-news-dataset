LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Boris Okuliar is set to join the The Carlyle Group <CG.O> in a newly created role as head of capital markets for its Global Market Strategies (GMS) business, the private equity firm announced.

Okuliar will be based in New York and is due to join Carlyle in February from UBS, where he was head of leveraged capital markets in London. Prior to UBS, Okuliar worked for Barclays Capital, where he was EMEA head of high yield capital markets. At Carlyle, Okuliar will also act as head of capital markets for Carlyle GMS Finance, Carlyle's middle market lending platform and private business development company, where he will primarily focus on sourcing leveraged finance investment opportunities from banks and financial sponsors across the U.S. "With his extensive background in syndicated and middle market leveraged finance in the U.S. and Europe, Boris will play an important role in helping ensure that Global Market Strategies, and in particular our GMS Finance business, are strongly anchored within the banking and sponsor community, enabling us to continue to invest wisely and create value for our investors," said Michael Petrick, head of GMS at Carlyle.  The announcement follows news earlier this week that middle market lending veterans Randy Schwimmer and Hugh Wilder have left Carlyle GMS Finance, as first reported by Thomson Reuters LPC. Both were managing directors. [ID:nL2N0KI1J6]
