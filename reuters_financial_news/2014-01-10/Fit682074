Jan 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Richmond Park CLO III Limited notes final ratings, as follows: EUR351.050m class A-1: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR74.375m class A-2: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable  EUR34.210m class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable  EUR26.785m class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable  EUR46.110m class D: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable  EUR15.610m class E: 'B- sf'; Outlook Stable EUR67.550m subordinated notes: not rated Richmond Park CLO Limited is an arbitrage cash flow collateralised loan  obligation (CLO). Net proceeds from the note issuance were used to purchase a  EUR595m portfolio of European leveraged loans and bonds. The portfolio is  managed by Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Europe Limited. The transaction has a four  year re-investment period scheduled to end in 2018.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Payment Frequency Switch The notes pay quarterly while the portfolio assets can reset to a semi-annual  basis. The transaction has an interest smoothing account, but no liquidity  facility. Nevertheless, a large proportion of assets resetting to a semi-annual  basis in any one quarterly period may cause a liquidity stress for the  non-deferrable senior notes. The reset risk is mitigated by a switch option  whereby the payment frequency on the notes will switch to semi-annual if, during  any due period, 20.0% or more of the portfolio assets reset to a semi-annual  basis and as a result the projected portfolio proceeds for the following  quarterly payment date are insufficient to cover the accrued interest on the  senior notes on the payment date. The eligibility criteria prevent the purchase  of assets paying interest less frequently than semi-annually.   Portfolio Credit Quality The covenanted minimum Fitch weighted average rating factor for assigning  ratings is 34.0. Fitch therefore expects the average credit quality of obligors  to be in the 'B'/'B-' range. Fitch has public ratings or credit opinions on all  assets in the initial portfolio.   Above Average Recoveries Portfolio profile tests ensure that at least 90.0% of the portfolio will  comprise senior secured assets. Fitch views the recovery prospects for these  assets as more favourable than for second-lien, unsecured and mezzanine assets.  The covenanted minimum weighted average recovery rate for assigning expected  ratings is 69.5%. Fitch assigns Recovery Ratings to all assets in the initial  portfolio.   Limited Interest Rate Risk The notes pay on a floating index while 10.0% of the portfolio assets can be  fixed rate. Fitch modelled a 10.0% fixed-rate bucket in its analysis and the  rated notes can withstand the excess spread compression in a rising interest  rate environment.Limited FX Risk Asset swaps are used to mitigate any currency risk on non-euro-denominated  assets. The transaction is allowed to invest up to 10.0% of the portfolio in  non-euro-denominated assets, provided that suitable asset swaps can be entered  into.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A 25% increase in the expected obligor default probability would lead to a  downgrade of one to two notches for the rated notes. A 25% reduction in the  expected recovery rates would lead to a downgrade of one to three notches for  the rated notes.   Amendments to Documents The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or noteholder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a rating action  commentary if the change has a negative impact on the then current ratings. Such  amendments may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis  confirms the expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity. If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from a rating  perspective, Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that the  structure considers the confirmation to be given if Fitch declines to comment.
