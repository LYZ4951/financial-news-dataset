Jan 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Gas Natural SDG,  S.A.'s <GAS.MC> Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' and removed it from  Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating  actions is provided at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions reflect Fitch's projection of positive free cash flow in  2014-2015, and our expectations that the company will continue to reduce  leverage as per its updated strategic plan and maintain credit ratios  commensurate with the 'BBB+' rating. This is despite the negative impact on  EBITDA of another set of unfavourable regulatory changes to the Spanish  electricity market announced in July 2013. Our rating action assumes that  potential negative EBITDA impact of possible regulatory changes to the Spanish  gas market, which may be announced in mid-2014, would be less pronounced for Gas  Natural than that in the electricity market.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Successful Deleveraging The Stable Outlook is underpinned by Fitch's expectations that Gas Natural's  leverage will continue decreasing in the short- to medium-term, with funds from  operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage improving to around 3.9x in 2013 and 3.7x  in 2014 from 4.1x in 2012. This is despite the likely impact of the regulatory  changes from July 2013 in Spain. The impact of the regulatory measures is partly  offset by expected savings within a cost efficiency plan for which we assumed  only a partial success. The Outlook for Gas Natural's Long-term IDR is Stable,  despite our negative sector outlook for Iberian utilities, reflecting the  company's free cash flow generation and continued debt reduction.  Balanced Business Profile The ratings are supported by Gas Natural's integrated strong business profile in  both gas and electricity. A significant portion of the company's earnings (52.5%  of 9M13 EBITDA) are regulated and mainly derived from its gas and electricity  distribution activities in Spain and Latam, providing cash flow visibility,  despite the 2012-2013 regulatory changes that reduced regulated earnings. In  addition, about 13% of 9M13 EBITDA was quasi-regulated, comprising mostly of  regulated generation, long-term contracted generation (PPAs) and generation in  the special regime.   Lower Regulated Earnings The July 2013 regulatory measures reduced regulated earnings through lower  returns on electricity distribution assets and renewables and also through lower  capacity payments for gas-fired plants. According to the company's assumption  these changes will reduce EBITDA by about EUR180m or about 4% in 2014, on top of  the EUR420m EBITDA reduction stemming from the 2012 regulatory changes.   Tariff Deficit Exposure Gas Natural's exposure to tariff deficit (TD) decreased during 2013 to about  EUR0.5bn at end-2013 from EUR1.1bn at end-2012 as a result of higher securitised  and collected amounts compared with the new TD that arose during the period. We  expect that the measures announced in July 2013 will effectively eliminate the  new TD from 2014.   Gas Networks Less Exposed  The Spanish regulatory office is currently reviewing the gas sector regulatory  framework. Similar to the electricity market reforms, the aim is to prevent  further growth of the gas TD and introduce mechanisms to eliminate the  outstanding TD in the system (estimated at around EUR0.4bn at FYE13). Fitch  expects the earnings impact from a possible regulatory decision to be visible  from around mid-2014. However, the impact is likely to be smaller compared with  that seen in the Spanish electricity business as the cumulative gas TD is  substantially lower than the electricity TD.   Continued Exposure to Spain The company generated 56% of 9M13 EBITDA in Spain. Fitch does not expect this to  significantly change in 2014, but it may reduce over the long term as the  company increases, in relative terms, investments outside Spain, in particular  in Latam. We do not currently view this gradual shift as affecting Gas Natural's  business risk.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: - Further reduction of FFO adjusted net leverage to around 3.0x or below on a  sustained basis and FFO interest coverage around 5.5x  (5.2x in FY12) or above  on a sustained basis - Improvement in the operating and regulatory environment  Negative: Future developments that could lead to a negative rating action  include: - FFO adjusted net leverage close to or above 4.0x and FFO interest coverage  below 4.5x on sustained basis - Substantial deterioration of the operating environment or further government  measures that substantially reduce cash flows  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Gas Natural's liquidity position remains strong. It had around EUR7bn of  committed available credit lines with more than 15 entities and EUR4bn of  available cash as of end-September 2013. This liquidity buffer should enable it  to cover debt maturities until at least 2015 totalling EUR5.2bn. We expect Gas  Natural to generate positive free cash flow in 2014-2015.
