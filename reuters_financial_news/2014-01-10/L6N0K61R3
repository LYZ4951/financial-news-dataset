MOSCOW, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has again shifted its target exchange-rate corridor for the rouble by five kopecks following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline, it said on Friday.

The new corridor extends from 33.15 to 40.15 roubles to the dollar-euro currency basket <RUS=MCX> as of Jan. 9, compared to 33.10-40.10 previously.
