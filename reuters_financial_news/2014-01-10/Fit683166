Jan 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on  Kazakhtelecom JSC's <KZTK.KZ> (Kaztel) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Stable  from Negative and affirmed the IDR at 'BB'. A full list of rating actions is at  the end of this release.  Kaztel is a strong fixed-line incumbent with a near monopoly position in the  traditional telephony and high broadband market share operating in a benign  regulatory environment. The revision of the Outlook is driven by a significant  reduction in the company's total debt due to repayments from cash on the balance  sheet, and certain capex cuts as well as an overall revision of the company's  capex plan resulting in a milder leverage spike. Fitch no longer expects that  the company's total debt/EBITDA ratio will exceed 2.5x.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Incumbent Positions Kaztel's is likely to maintain its dominant positions in the fixed-line segment,  helped by benign regulation and the shortage of alternative networks. Kaztel  estimated its fixed-line telephony market share at a high 92% at end-2012.  Fixed-to-mobile substitution is a key threat, and this will drive modest  fixed-line disconnections and pricing pressures, in our view.   Positive Broadband Prospects The Kazakh broadband market still retains strong growth potential, driven by  relatively low broadband penetration in the country (26% of households as of  end-2012). Kaztel's much relied-on ADSL technology allows it to roll-out  broadband services ahead of its peers. Broadband leadership will be supported by  a rapid roll-out of fibre infrastructure in key territories. The segment's  revenue growth is likely to lag subscriber additions as we expect the company's  currently inflated tariffs to remain under regulatory and competitive pressure  in key cities.  Ambitious Mobile Strategy Kaztel's newly launched LTE service may face only limited operating success  while being the key leverage driver in 2014-2016. The Kazakh mobile market is  well penetrated with 3G services and is highly competitive. It will be a  challenge to migrate CDMA customers to a GSM network as currently planned. There  is a risk that churn may increase and the company is likely to run significant  one-off costs.   Leverage Increase Likely High capex on the back of LTE roll-out and fixed-line network upgrades will push  free cash flow (FCF) deep into negative territory in 2013-2014, and will  continue weighing on cash generation in 2015-2016. Leverage is likely to rise,  but we project it will remain below 2.5x total debt/EBITDA.  Weak Domestic Banking System The Kazakh domestic banking system is weak, implying a lack of local funding and  resultant high FX risks, few committed credit facilities and potentially limited  access to deposits. Consequently, we primarily focus on the company's gross debt  metrics in our analysis.   Well-Spread Maturity Profile but High FX Risks Kaztel's debt profile is well spread with no medium-term debt redemption peaks.  The company is likely to finance its LTE capex with new debt which may change  this. Exposure to foreign currency risk is high, with 89% of debt denominated in  or pegged to foreign currencies at end-3Q13.   Off-Balance Sheet Liability a Concern Kaztel issued a USD300m guarantee to China Development Bank covering a loan to  Kazakhmys, its sister company, under an agreement with its controlling  shareholder, Samruk-Kazyna [SMRKA.UL] (BBB/Stable) in 2009. This guarantee will be  triggered if Samruk-Kazyna defaults on its payments to China Development Bank.  Samruk-Kazyna later issued a cross-guarantee to Kaztel promising to pay back any  amounts that it had to pay to China Development Bank. Fitch notes this situation  as a corporate governance concern, and this is factored into Kaztel's ratings.   Weak Parent-Subsidiary Linkage Kaztel's ratings reflect its standalone credit profile. Kaztel is of only  limited strategic importance for Kazakhstan, while operating and legal ties with  its controlling shareholder, government-controlled Samruk-Kazyna, are weak.  Although indirect government control is a positive credit factor, it does not  justify any notching up, in our view.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A protracted rise in gross leverage to above 2.5x total debt/EBITDA and 3x FFO  adjusted leverage, and/or a material increase in refinancing risks may lead to  negative rating action. A sustained decrease in gross leverage to below 1.0x  total debt/EBITDA and 1.5x FFO adjusted leverage and successful development of  the mobile segment demonstrating strong operating and financial performance  could be rating positive.
