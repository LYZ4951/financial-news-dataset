MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks posted their biggest one-day gain since last November on Friday, after underwhelming U.S. jobs data raised hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve will slow its rollback of a bond-buying scheme that has boosted emerging market equities.

Mexico's IPC index rose 2.10 percent to close at 42,458.51 points, while Brazil's Bovespa index <.BVSP>, which also benefited from the weaker-than-expected jobs data, rose 0.76 points to 49,696.45 points. Data released on Friday showed U.S. employers hired the fewest workers in nearly three years in December, handing the Fed a headache as it mulls how quickly to scale back its massive monetary stimulus program. [ID:nL2N0KJ291] The Fed, which already trimmed its $85 billion in monthly bond buying by $10 billion last month, has said it will roll back the stimulus incrementally as the U.S. economy improves.   In Mexico, where stocks ended the week up nearly 1 percent, shares in broadcaster Televisa <TLVACPO.MX> drove gains on Friday, rising 3.63 percent. In Brazil, stocks ended the week down 2.52 percent. On Friday, shares in state-oil producer Petrobras <PETR4.SA> led the index higher, rising 1.72 percent, while shares in iron-ore producer Vale <VALE5.SA> added 0.53 percent. Chile's IPSA index <.IPSA> dropped 0.68 percent on Friday to close on 3,620.46 points, its lowest level in more than 4 months. The index lost 2.11 percent over the week.
