BANGKOK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Thai stocks posted modest losses on Friday as some large caps, including PTT <PTT.BK> and Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> regained early lost ground, while Indonesian shares ended at their highest in one week, helped by inflows and a rise in the rupiah <IDR=ID>.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> eased 0.22 percent, with a 2.5 percent gain on the week, its first in three. It fell 1.4 percent at one point, as investors remained wary of domestic political tensions ahead of a major anti-government protest on Monday. Foreign investors were net sellers of 1.1 billion baht ($33.3 million), trimming their net buying on the week to $73 million, Thomson Reuters data showed. <TH/TRADING02> Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> climbed 1.3 percent to 4,254.97, the highest close since Jan. 3, erasing its weekly loss to 0.06 percent. Banking shares were actively traded, with shares of Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> up almost 6 percent.  Jakarta brought in net inflows of $7.92 million on the day, while the rupiah <IDR=ID> edged up 0.25 percent on Friday.
