HANOI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> climbed 1.18 percent at the break on Friday, supported by buying of blue chips and speculative stocks such as property firm FLC Group <FLC.HM>, an analyst said.

Investment has been pouring in Vietnamese stocks, a very positive sign that boosts investors' sentiment in the short term, said analyst Nguyen The Minh at Viet Capital Securities. Volume reached 58.2 million shares in the morning session, close to the five-day average of 68.5 million, Reuters data showed. PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, the country's largest listed firm, led the gain with shares advancing 4.41 percent, followed by dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> that rose 1.47 percent. Most shares gained strongly with high volume, showing the index would rise beyond 530 points in the next few weeks, Minh said. The index, Southeast Asia's best performer, failed to surpass its strong resistance level of 530-533 points in 2013, during which it reached the year-high close of 527.97 points on June 7, according to analysts and Reuters data.
