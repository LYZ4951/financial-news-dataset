PARIS, Jan 10 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Friday, reversing the previous session's losses with markets on the euro zone periphery adding to brisk gains made so far this year.

Sentiment was boosted by a surge in Chinese imports, although the market's gains could be limited ahead of the U.S. monthly jobs report that may shed light on the outlook for the federal Reserve's stimulus programme. At 0806 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top  European shares was up 0.6 percent at 1,322.58 points, with Spain's IBEX <.IBEX> up 0.9 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> up 0.7 percent. Shares in mining and metal groups bucked the trend, with Rio Tinto <RIO.L> down 1 percent and Norsk Hydro <NHY.OL> down 1.3 percent, after U.S. aluminium major Alcoa Inc <AA.N> posted a massive quarterly loss and issued an outlook for stagnant growth in global aluminum demand.
