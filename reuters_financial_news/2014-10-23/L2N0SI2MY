MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Grupo Financiero Banorte, Mexico's fourth-largest bank by assets, said on Thursday its third-quarter net profit rose 15 percent from the same period last year, mostly as a result of its increased stake in a pensions and insurance unit.

The bank's <GFNORTEO.MX> net profit rose to 4.04 billion pesos ($301 million) for the July-September period.
