FRANKFURT, Oct 23 (Reuters) - None of the 24 German banks taking part in stress tests led by the European Central Bank will need to raise capital in the next six to nine months as a result of the tests, daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday, without naming sources.

Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> passed the balance sheet tests as measured at end-December 2013, the paper said.  HSH Nordbank [HSH.UL], long seen at risk of failing European Central Bank tests of its financial stability, is also on the "safe side", the newspaper reported.
