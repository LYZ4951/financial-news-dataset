Oct 23 (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Chubb Corp's <CB.N> quarterly profit rose 9.8 percent, helped by higher insurance rates across its businesses and lower catastrophe losses.

The company's net income rose to $594 million, or $2.47 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $541 million, or $2.10 per share, a year earlier. Net written premiums rose about 4.6 percent to $3.17 billion. [ID:nPn9lczDV]
