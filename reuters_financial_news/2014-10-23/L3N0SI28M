SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged lower on Thursday, weighed by nagging concerns over slowing global growth, although losses were capped by a late rally in Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> after the release of its third-quarter earnings outlook.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> shed 0.27 percent to close at 1,931.65. Hyundai Motor missed consensus forecasts by reporting a 29 percent fall in net profit for the July-September quarter, but the automaker said fourth-quarter profit was seen to be improving and that it was mulling a sizable increase in dividend rates. [ID:nL3N0SH28O][ID:nL3N0SI1L4] Hyundai shares jumped on the news to close 5.9 percent higher, its biggest one-day gain since April 3, 2012. Hyundai's sister automaker Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS> gained 2.8 percent, while auto-parts manufacturer Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd <012330.KS> soared 4.8 percent following the news. The South Korean won <KRW=> fell on Thursday, tracking dollar gains in the wake of data showing a modest rebound in U.S inflation, prompting market players to push out the possibility of a delayed rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
