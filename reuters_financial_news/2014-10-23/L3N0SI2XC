TOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Japan's Asahi Mutual Life Insurance substantially boosted its investment in foreign bonds to more than double the levels initially planned, as the Bank of Japan's aggressive easing made domestic bonds less attractive to hold, a senior executive said on Thursday.

Asahi, with total assets of about 5.55 trillion yen (51.78 billion dollars), will continue to increase its foreign bond portfolio in the second half through March after purchasing 180 billion yen in foreign bonds in the first half, Takahiro Ono, general manager at the insurer's asset allocation unit, told Reuters in an interview.  That compares with 50-100 billion yen it had allocated for the fiscal year. Of that amount allocated in the first half, about 60 percent is in U.S. debt, more than 30 percent in Europe and the remainder in Australia. "We decided to shift our planned Japanese bond allocation to foreign bonds as domestic yields are stuck at low levels," Ono said. "Depending on U.S. interest rates, we have room to increase more of U.S. bonds." For now, Asahi plans to maintain the ratio of currency hedging on its foreign bonds, currently around 90 percent, while also keeping investments in yen bonds unchanged for the second half through March, Ono said. The insurer sees the dollar trading between 102-115 yen by end of March, compared to around 107.10 yen on Thursday <JPY=>.  Asahi expects the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield <JP10YTN=JBTC> to trade between 0.4-0.8 percent during the same period as a result of the Bank of Japan's massive bond purchases - a major plank of the central bank's monetary easing strategy aimed at reflating the economy. The 10-year yield currently trades around 0.480. The insurer also expects the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to move between 2.0 percent and 3.0 percent through to the end of March, as the U.S. Federal Reserve moves toward tightening policy rates next year for the first time since the global financial crisis.
