OSLO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - DNB <DNB.OL>, Norway's largest bank, reported third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations on Thursday and said its loan losses would be below last year's level.

The following are comments from Chief Executive Rune Bjerke and Chief Financial Office Bjoern Erik Naess.   Chief Executive Rune Bjerke:  ABOUT THE RESULTS "We are delivering according to our plans." "We have a 400 million crown gain on our basis swaps. During the year this swings both ways. But more important is the underlying trend: net interest rates are increasing, cost percentage is falling, losses on loans are falling and other revenues are increasing." ABOUT CORE CAPITAL "We are very satisfied with our core capital of 12.6 percent, it's up 1.6 percentage points from the third quarter of last year. We are somewhat ahead of our target of 13.5-14 percent by the end of 2016. "We are still going to build another 30 billion crowns before we reach our target."  ABOUT DECLINING OIL PRICES "There is nothing in the short to medium term that should worry us about our oil sector customers, as we see it today. We do stress tests down to $60 dollar per barrel and we also make liquidity tests down to $30 dollars." ABOUT LENDING MARGINS "Margins on our loans will be further reduced in the fourth quarter based on our earlier announced rate cuts, and they will be fully implemented from December 6." "We have said that we have an ambition to keep volume weighted rate margins flat, we keep that ambition. We still have potential to increase margins on our deposits."   ABOUT DIVIDENDS "We will come back to our dividend policy at our capital market day in London. What we have said earlier is still our policy. "But there is no doubt that we see increased appetite among investors for increased direct dividends. We see the trend in oil and gas, banks and telecoms. The exceptions may be hi-tech and IT."  "At the same time we have to follow demands from authorities as well as what our competitors are doing."  ABOUT GROWTH "We will not adjust volume growth forecasts. We want to assure a return on our equity at 12 percent, at least. To make that, we have to focus on loyal customers and capital easy products."
