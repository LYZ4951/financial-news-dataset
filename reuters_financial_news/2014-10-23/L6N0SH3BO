OSLO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The sale of new Norwegian homes rose by 39 percent from mid-August to mid-October compared to the previous two months and by 35 percent from the same year-ago period, when the market saw steep decline, Samfunnsoekonomisk Analyse (SA) said on Thursday.

In the populous south-east region, including Oslo, new home sales rose by 47 percent from mid-August to mid-October compared to the same period last year. "The sale is now back to the level of 2011 and 2012, prior to the negative turnaround in the market," SA said.
