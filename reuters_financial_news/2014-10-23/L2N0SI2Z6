NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - GM Financial, the in-house financing arm of General Motors Co <GM.N>, said on Thursday it received subpoenas in September from state attorneys general and other authorities over its subprime auto lending and securitization practices.

In July, the auto lender received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice over similar issues. [ID:nL4N0QA4DR] GM Financial issued more securities backed by subprime auto loans between the start of the year and July than any other lender besides Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc <SC.N>, according to Standard & Poor's.  The company made the disclosure in a quarterly finding with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
