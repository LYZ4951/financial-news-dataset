OSLO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Newsprint and magazine paper producer Norske Skog <NSG.OL> expects prices in Europe to remain relatively stable going into 2015, the company said on Thursday after reporting weaker than expected profits for the third quarter.

Gross operating earnings (EBITDA) rose to 208 million Norwegian crowns ($31.36 million) in the third quarter, up from 176 million in same quarter last year but below the average analyst prediction of 253 million. Norske Skog said a planned nine-week stoppage at one of its three paper making machines at Skogn in Norway, and the ramp-up of magazine paper production at the Australian Boyer site, had held down earnings. Demand for newsprint and magazine paper in Europe continued to shrink, hit by the continuing growth of online media, and decreased by 5 percent and 4 percent respectively in the first eight months of the year compared to same period last year. "The market balance for newsprint is acceptable, while the operating rate for magazine paper currently is not satisfactory," Norske Skog said, referring to the European market. Norske Skog's net interest bearing debt of 6.93 billion Norwegian crowns is a significant challenge, with about 1 billion crowns of bond debt maturing in 2015 and a similar amount in 2016, while more than 3 billion matures in 2017. "The board has full focus on the upcoming bond maturity in October 2015 and is considering several options," Norske Skog said.
