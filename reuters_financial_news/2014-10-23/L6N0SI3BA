MOSCOW, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest food retailer Magnit <MGNT.MM> is expected to report on Friday a more than 29-percent jump in net profit for the third quarter as its purchasing terms continue to improve on the back of rapid store rollout and sales growth.

The low-price chain, with more than 9,000 stores across Russian regions, is seen posting a net profit of $366 million, up from $283 million in the same period last year, an average estimate of 10 banks and brokerages showed. The average forecast for earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was $643 million, up 25.5 percent, with the margin improving to 12.0 percent from 11.6 percent. "We see the potential for strong EBITDA profitability during the quarter, which would indicate upside to its current year guidance and be positive for its shares," Renaissance Capital said in a note. Magnit has already reported third-quarter sales of $5.3 billion, up 21.5 percent in dollar terms year-on-year.  Its shares have risen around 12 percent since the start of the year as investors praise its resilience to Russia's economic crisis and political risks. "During the conference call management is likely to raise its full-year 2014 guidance ... We think the sales target could be revised to 28-31 percent and the EBITDA margin range may increase to 11.2-11.5 percent," said Mikhail Terentiev at Otkritie Capital. Magnit has previously forecast 26-29 percent revenue growth and EBITDA margin of 10.6-10.9 percent.
