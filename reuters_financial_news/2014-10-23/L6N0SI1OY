MILAN, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> and Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> fell in early trade on Thursday due to concerns about possible additional capital needs at the two Italian banks following region-wide bank stress tests.

"In such volatile markets, rumours about the outcome of the ECB's review are hitting banks seen as the most vulnerable," an Italian trader said. By 0727 GMT shares in Carige lost 2 percent and Monte dei Paschi 1.8 percent against a 0.8 percent fall in Italy's banking stock index <.FTIT8300>. A Bloomberg report on Wednesday said the two banks would likely need to raise further capital. [ID:nL6N0SI1N0] The European Central Bank is carrying out the checks of how the biggest euro zone banks have valued their assets, and whether they have enough capital to weather another economic crash, before taking over as their supervisor. The results of the stress tests on 130 banks are due to be unveiled on Sunday.
