SHANGHAI, Oct 23 (Reuters) - China shares fell to one-month lows by midday on Thursday, dampened by concerns over liquidity amid a rush of initial public offerings as well as profit-taking pressure.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> fell 0.9 percent to 2,305.6 points by the midday break, the lowest level since Sept. 24. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also declined 0.7 percent to a one-month low.  "Especially after gaining more than 10 percent since July, it is common for investors to take profits and the market to digest previous gains," said Zhang Qi, an analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai, adding that the current price correction would likely end soon. Weighing on market sentiment are concerns over liquidity as a slew of companies conduct IPOs this week. Local media estimate that as much as 900 billion yuan ($147.1 billion) in funds would be locked up from the market. In addition, the central bank declined to inject money into the interbank market for the second consecutive week via its open market operations. [ID:L3N0SI188]  Most heavyweight stocks fell, dragging the market lower. PetroChina Co Ltd <601857.SS> fell 1.0 percent and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS> declined 1.4 percent. China Shipbuilding Industry Co Ltd <601989.SS> dropped 2.1 percent after gaining the previous session on government support policies. The market had little reaction to a private survey showing China's factory sector grew a touch faster in October as the figure does not point to a turnaround in the final quarter of the year. Growth in new orders at home and abroad slowed in October and producer prices fell, underscoring the pressures facing the slowing economy.
