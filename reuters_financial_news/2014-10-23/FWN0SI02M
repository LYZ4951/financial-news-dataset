PARIS, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Unibail-Rodamco <UNBP.PA>, Europe's biggest real estate company, said revenue for the first nine months rose 9.9 percent, boosted by rental income from new malls and extensions of existing ones.

The Franco-Dutch company, which has 80 percent of its portfolio focused on shopping centres, is in the process of trimming its portfolio to focus on large regional malls.  Nine-month revenue reached 1.400 billion euros ($1.77 billion) against 1.275 billion euros in the same period of 2013 as gross rental income from its shopping centre division rose 9.2 percent. French rival Klepierre <LOIM.PA>, which is taking over Dutch group Corio <COR.AS>, reported a 9.8 percent drop in nine-month revenues on Thursday. It is also selling off smaller properties to focus on bigger malls. [ID:nL6N0SH51S]
