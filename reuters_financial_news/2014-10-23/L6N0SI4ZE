LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> said on Thursday it has signed a contract to lease a new office in east London financial district Canary Wharf, bringing the majority of its London-based businesses to one location.

The bank, which currently has six offices across Britain's capital, will occupy eight of the 26 floors of a new building at One Bank Street, it said in a statement. The property is expected to be completed in 2019 and will house the group's UK corporate and investment banking division, securities services, asset management and back- and middle-office private banking activities. Canary Wharf is home to the headquarters of Barclays <BARC.L> and HSBC <HSBA.L>, as well as the main European offices of JPMorgan <JPM.N>, Citi <C.N> and Morgan Stanley <C.N>.
