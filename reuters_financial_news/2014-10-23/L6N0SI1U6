DUBAI, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Kuwait Finance House (KFH) <KFIN.KW>, the country's biggest Islamic lender, reported a 10 percent fall in third-quarter net profit on Thursday, in line with analysts' forecasts.

Net profit dropped to 35.5 million dinars ($122.7 million) in the three months to the end of September from 39.3 million dinars in the same period a year ago, the lender said in a bourse filing. That compared with analysts' average forecast of 35.2 million dinars in a Reuters poll of four analysts.
