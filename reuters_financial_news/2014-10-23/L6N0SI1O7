FRANKFURT, Oct 23 (Reuters) - German reinsurer Hannover Re <HNRGn.DE> raised its minimum return on equity (ROE) target and said its fast growing capital gave it room to take advantage of business opportunities, including takeovers.

"Capital management will become more important for Hannover Re," Chief Executive Ulrich Wallin said in presentation slides for an investor conference on Thursday.
