OSLO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - DNB <DNB.OL>, Norway's largest bank, plans a gradual recovery in its dividend ratio after several years of paying out less than its long-term target due to regulatory demands, Chief Financial Officer Bjoern Erik Naess told Reuters on Thursday.

In the past year, DNB has increased its core capital ratio to 12.6 percent from 11 percent, ahead of its own schedule, but is still required to lift it to between 13.5-14 percent by 2016. "You can't expect a similar growth rate. But we will grow and we are ahead of plan. But we will not say when we reach the target for core capital," Naess said, adding that the company may elaborate at its capital market day next month. Naess made it clear DNB's shareholders could expect a higher payout ratio in the coming years after paying out just 25 percent of its net earnings for both 2012 and 2013, against a long term ambition of paying out half its result. "We want our dividend to get closer to 50 percent. It will gradually increase. That is the intention," he said while adding that the dividend proposal will be made by the board. DNB has increased its equity by more than 70 billion Norwegian crowns ($10.66 billion US dollar) since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008, and has another 30 billion crowns to go before it reaches it's target of 13.5-14 percent core capital, Chief Executive Officer Rune Bjerke told investors.
