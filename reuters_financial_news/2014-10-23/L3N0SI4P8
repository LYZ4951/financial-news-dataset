Oct 23 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks mostly ended firmer on Thursday, with Malaysia and Singapore outperforming in the region amid mixed signals on the Chinese manufacturing sector.

Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> gained 1.1 percent, rising to its highest level since Oct. 9, led by financials. Malaysia <.KLSE> rose 0.8 percent to its highest close in two weeks, led by consumer cyclical stocks like Genting <GENT.KL> and Genting Malaysia <GENM.KL>.  Shares of Malaysia's second-biggest bank, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL>, fell after local media reported that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), a key CIMB shareholder, may be forced to cut its stake to push through a planned merger. It closed 0.2 percent weaker. [ID:nL3N0SI16V]  Asian shares sagged after a retreat on Wall Street and falling crude oil prices rekindled investor anxiety over slowing global growth, while a mixed picture on Chinese manufacturing failed to impress markets. [MKTS/GLOB] The latest manufacturing read on China did little to allay those concerns. The flash HSBC/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) edged up to 50.4 from a final reading of 50.2 in September, just a hair's breadth from the 50.3 reading forecast by analysts. [ID:nL3N0SH2QQ]  Among the decliners was the Philippine share index <.PSI>, closing down 0.5 percent, and Vietnam <.VNI>, which dropped 1.3 percent as investors offloaded shares after three days of gains that followed a sharp decline last week. The Thailand stock market <.SETI> was closed for a holiday.
