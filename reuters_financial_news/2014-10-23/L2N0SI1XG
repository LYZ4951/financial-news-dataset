NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have rejected industry arguments and are demanding that Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) managers hold some of each new fund, which the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) said will create a credit scarcity and boost U.S. corporate borrowing costs.

Few managers are able to put up the funds needed to comply with the new risk retention rules and the creation of CLOs could fall as a result. CLOs, which provide $350 billion of loans to U.S. companies, are the biggest buyers of U.S. leveraged loans and make up 42 percent of the U.S. buyside, according to LPC data.  "The terms of the final risk retention rule ... will negatively impact American credit markets and make financing for U.S. companies more expensive and scarce. The rule needlessly puts in place cumbersome requirements that will materially reduce the CLO market," said Bram Smith, chairman of the LSTA.  Final risk retention rules approved by six regulators on October 21 and October 22 require managers of new funds to retain 5 percent of the fair value of CLO liabilities.  These 'skin in the game' rules are designed to thwart loose lending practices that triggered the last credit crisis. The rule is expected to be effective for CLOs in December 2016, two years after risk retention is published in the Federal Register, which is likely to be within 60 days.  The LSTA tried to distance CLOs from the originate-to-distribute model of mortgage securitization as CLO managers actively buy and sell loans in their portfolios, unlike bankers who create and gather home loans to back bonds that they sell to investors.  Under the new rules, CLO managers will have to hold $25 million of notes of a new $500 million deal for example. The LSTA suggested a compromise - that CLO managers retain 5 percent of the equity tranche of a new deal rather than of the entire deal - but this was rebuffed with other proposals.  The regulators are asserting dominance over CLOs, which are customers of the banks that create the leveraged loans that they buy. Financial watchdogs have however made one concession, industry experts said.  "By allowing cash distributions to continue to the risk retention owners of a CLO deal, the regulators made a significant concession to the CLO industry that will likely leave the industry intact," said David Thatch, a partner in White & Case's securitization practice group.  While banks are likely to provide financing to big managers to finance retention which will be repaid by cash flows from CLO investments and other business income, the ability of smaller managers to raise capital by borrowing against their CLO investments will be a crucial test.  "For small CLO managers who only have CLOs, banks may be less inclined to lend money against the equity because there's little other collateral," Thatch said.   THE RACE IS ON  CLO managers, who face having to set balance sheet capital aside to meet the new risk retention rules, are now rushing new CLOs to the market at a record pace.  Nearly $100 billion of CLOs have priced in the year to date. This has already eclipsed last year's $81 billion, and is certain to pass the $101 billion record which was set in 2007, but smaller managers may face an uphill struggle to survive.  "We question the continuing presence of less frequent issuers, even if they are affiliated to larger institutions, and whether they will attract the type of long-term capital that the rules need from their sponsors," Ratul Roy, Citi's head of global structured credit research, said in a report. Investors may gravitate to larger managers that they see as having a future in CLOs, while others may demand price concessions from smaller managers.
