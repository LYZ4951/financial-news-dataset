MILAN/SAO PAULO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI> is in advanced talks to sell the mobile phone towers of its Brazilian unit TIM Participacoes <TIMP3.SA> and could ink a deal in weeks, three people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

Telecom Italia is aiming to raise 900 million euros ($1.1  billion) from the sale but the bids have come in at 500-600 million euros, the sources said. Telecom Italia's chief executive, Marco Patuano, put the Brazilian towers up for sale in November when he unveiled a 4-billion-euro plan to cut debt and help fund much-needed investments.  One of the sources said American Tower Corp <AMT.N> and Cell Site Solutions (CSS), a company backed by Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, were left in the race, adding a deal could see the asset being split between them.
