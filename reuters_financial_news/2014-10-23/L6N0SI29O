LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - European stocks were flat in choppy trade on Thursday as better-than-expected euro zone business activity data helped offset some weak corporate results from companies such as French tyre-maker Michelin <MICP.PA>.

Euro zone businesses performed much better than expected this month but did so by slashing prices again, and optimism about the future fell to its lowest level in over a year, surveys showed on Thursday. [ID:nL9N0Q301N] Earlier data showed Germany's activity increased in both the manufacturing and services industries, but France's business downturn deteriorated.  "Germany saved the day but people are still bearish and I think we are going to see some more weakness," Mike Reuter, a broker at Tradition, said. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was flat at 1,308.28 points at 0832 GMT, hovering some 7 percent above a 13-month low hit last week.  Weakness in emerging markets remained a drag on European companies, however.  Michelin and Unilever <ULVR.L> cited poor demand from emerging markets as the former cut its full-year revenue goal and the latter reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales. Unilever's London-listed shares were down 2.4 percent, while Michelin shed 3.6 percent.

[ID:nP6N0O902D] [ID:nL6N0SI14H] Among a handful of outperformers, Finland's Nokia <NOK1V.HE> beat market expectations as it reported strong third-quarter profit growth and lifted the profitability outlook for its core network unit on the back of network roll-outs in North America and China, sending its shares up 5.3 percent. Danish industrial enzymes maker Novozymes <NZYMb.CO> also reported third quarter earnings above expectations and raised its full-year outlook for operating profit growth. Its shares rose 6.6 percent.
