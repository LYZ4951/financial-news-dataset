TOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Japan's Taiyo Life Insurance plans to continue slightly increasing its foreign bond purchases, concentrating on U.S. Treasuries, in the second half of the current fiscal year through March 2015, a senior official said on Thursday.

Financial markets closely track the stated plans of Japan's life insurance companies, which collectively manage more than 180 trillion yen ($1.68 trillion) of assets, for clues to institutional investment trends.
