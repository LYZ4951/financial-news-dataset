SEOUL, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> posted a 29 percent year-on-year fall in its quarterly net profit, missing analysts' estimates, hit by a strong local currency and slowing sales growth in its key U.S. and South Korean markets.

Hyundai Motor, which along with its affiliate Kia Motors <000270.KS> is the world's fifth-biggest automaker, on Thursday reported a 1.52 trillion Korean won ($1.44 billion) net profit for the July to September quarter, slightly lower than a consensus forecast of 1.79 trillion won, according to a Reuters' poll of 12 analysts. Its third-quarter sales rose 2 percent to 21.28 trillion won year-on-year.
