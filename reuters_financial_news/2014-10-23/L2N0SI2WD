NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Rengan Rajaratnam, who was cleared of criminal insider trading charges following the conviction of his older brother, Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, has agreed to pay more than $841,000 to resolve civil claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The settlement was filed on Thursday by the SEC in New York federal court, three months after a federal jury in Manhattan acquitted Rengan Rajaratnam of conspiring to engage in insider trading, a rare defeat for U.S. prosecutors.
