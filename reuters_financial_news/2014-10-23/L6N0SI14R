LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Dave Lewis, the new chief executive of Tesco <TSCO.L>, said he would not unveil a new strategy for Britain's biggest retailer in one fell swoop, saying instead changes would unfold for customers.

"I don't think you should look for me for a point in time when I'm going to stand up and declare a strategy for Tesco," he told reporters on Thursday. "I think this a very dynamic business, and actually I'd like you to feel some of the changes before I talk about them. And also, the idea would be not to give too much insight to my competitors as to what my strategy may be."
