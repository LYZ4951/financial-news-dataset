LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - European stocks fell early on Thursday as weak results from French tyre-maker Michelin <MICP.PA> and consumer goods group Unilever <ULVR.L> <UNc.AS> added to a subdued tone for global equities overnight.

Unilever fell 3 percent in London by 0705 GMT after it reported a weaker-than-expected 2.1 percent rise in third-quarter sales on Thursday as a slowdown in emerging markets continued to crimp performance. [ID:nASN00053G] Michelin was down 4.8 percent as it cut its full-year sales goal and said it would rein in investment after third-quarter sales fell 4.6 percent, weighed down by an emerging-market slump and weaker European truck tyre demand. [ID:nL6N0SH55J] Adding to the gloom, a survey of French manufacturing activity came in lower than expected. Investors were awaiting equivalent surveys from Germany and the euro zone as a whole at 0730 GMT and 0800 GMT.
