SHANGHAI, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Hong Kong main share index finished lower on Thursday in line with regional bourses, but further declines were capped by slightly stronger China manufacturing activity.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> unofficially closed down 0.3 percent at 23,333.18 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong stayed broadly flat throughout the day and finished up 0.1 percent.  Analysts said faster expansion in Chinese factory activity in a private survey limited selling in Hong Kong. The flash HSBC/Markit manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) edged up to a three-month high of 50.4 from a final reading of 50.2 in September.
