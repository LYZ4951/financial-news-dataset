Oct 23 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks mostly gained on Thursday, with Malaysia and Singapore outperforming other markets in the region amid mixed signals on the Chinese manufacturing sector.

Malaysian shares <.KLSE> gained 0.8 percent to their highest in nearly two weeks, led by consumer cyclical stocks like Genting <GENT.KL> and Genting Malaysia <GENM.KL>.  Shares of Malaysia's second-biggest bank, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL>, fell after local media reported that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), a key CIMB shareholder, may be forced to cut its stake to push through a planned merger. [ID:nL3N0SI16V]  Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> rose to its highest level since Oct. 9, led by financials, while the Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> was up 0.4 percent.  Asian shares sagged after a retreat on Wall Street and falling crude oil prices rekindled investor anxiety over slowing global growth, while a mixed picture on Chinese manufacturing failed to impress markets. [MKTS/GLOB] The latest manufacturing read on China did little to allay those concerns. The flash HSBC/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) edged up to 50.4 from a final reading of 50.2 in September, just a hair's breadth from the 50.3 reading forecast by analysts. [ID:nL3N0SH2QQ]  Bucking the trend, the Philippines share index <.PSI> fell 0.5 percent, while Vietnam <.VNI> dropped more than 1 percent as investors offloaded shares after three days of gains that followed a sharp decline last week.
