June 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Beijing Infrastructure Investment's [BEINF.UL] (BII; A+/Stable) USD2bn medium-term note (MTN) programme a final Long-Term Rating of 'A+'. At the same time, Fitch has assigned the CNY1.2bn 3.75% senior unsecured notes issued under the programme a final  rating of 'A+'. The notes are due in 2017 and the company plans to use the  proceeds primarily for the development of the urban railway transit system in  Beijing, as working capital and for general corporate purposes. The assignment of the final ratings on the MTN programme and yuan denominated  notes follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already  received. The final ratings are in line with the expected rating assigned on 16  June 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - MTN Programme and Yuan Senior Unsecured Notes The notes under the MTN programme will be issued by Eastern Creation II  Investment Holdings Ltd, and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by  Beijing Infrastructure Investment (Hong Kong) Limited (BII HK), a wholly owned  subsidiary of BII. The notes under the MTN programme will be senior unsecured  obligations of BII HK and also rank pari passu with all other obligations of BII  HK. In place of a guarantee, BII has granted a keepwell and liquidity support deed  and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking to ensure that BII HK has  sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations under the guarantee for  the notes under the MTN programme. The notes under the MTN programme are rated at the same level as BII's IDR,  given the strong link between BII HK and BII and because the keepwell and  liquidity support deed and deed of equity interest purchase undertaking transfer  the ultimate responsibility of payment to BII. In Fitch's opinion, both the keepwell and liquidity support deed and the deed of  equity interest purchase undertaking signal a strong intention from BII to  ensure that BII HK has sufficient funds to honour the debt obligations. The  agency also believes BII intends to maintain its reputation and credit profile  in the international offshore market, and is unlikely to default on its offshore  obligations. Additionally, a default by BII HK could have significant negative  repercussions on BII for any future offshore funding. Fitch's rating on the MTN programme is for the programme in general and  individual issues under it may not be assigned the same rating as the  programme's.
