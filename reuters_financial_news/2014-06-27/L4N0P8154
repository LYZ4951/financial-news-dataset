JAKARTA, June 27 (Reuters) - Shares of PT Bumi Resources Tbk <BUMI.JK> jumped as much as 15 percent on Friday after the Indonesian coal miner priced its rights issue at 250 rupiah a share.

Bumi said on Thursday it will sell about 32.2 billion shares to raise 8.05 trillion rupiah ($682.8 million) to pay off some of its debt to Chinese sovereign wealth fund, CIC [CIC.UL]. [ID:nL4N0P72RN] Bumi shares hit as high as 173 rupiah on Friday. The stock had plunged to an 11-year-low on Monday due to concerns about its ability to repay debt, but it had since recouped some of its losses.
