SOFIA, June 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Bulgaria's First Investment Bank <5F4.BB> were down 19.79 percent at 0750 GMT on Friday, following a similar sharp drop in the stock price on Thursday.

Shares in other banks were also down.  A run on Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> last week prompted the central bank to seize control of the country's fourth largest lender and temporarily shut down its operations.
