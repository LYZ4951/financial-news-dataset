STOCKHOLM, June 27 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank is seen cutting interest rates at next week's monetary policy meeting as the Riksbank continues to struggle to reach its two percent inflation target, according to a poll of analysts.

All 15 of the participants think the Riksbank will lower the key repo rate on Thursday to 0.50 percent from 0.75 percent. Four of the participants forecast one more rate cut this year while the rest saw rates unchanged. All analysts surveyed said they expected the Riksbank to lower its rate path, pushing the next projected rate hike further into the future. In April, the Riksbank saw its next rate hike in the first half of 2015. Ake Gustafsson, an analyst at Swedbank, said he believes the Riksbank has no option but to lower rates and added the pressure has increased since the European Central Bank cut rates and announced further liquidity measures earlier this month. "Inflation is annoyingly low," he said.  "We believe that inflation will remain very low during the summer and a continued soft international monetary policy, we believe, calls for yet another a cut in September" Sweden's consumer price index fell 0.2 percent in May from a year earlier. Underlying inflation, which strips out interest rate effects and is closely watched by the Riksbank, was 0.4 percent. [ID:nL5N0OT1HS] Sweden has come through the financial crisis relatively unscathed. The Riksbank, wary of the high levels of household indebtedness, has kept interest rates at 0.75 percent since December last year, despite inflation undershooting its 2 percent inflation target for more than three years.
