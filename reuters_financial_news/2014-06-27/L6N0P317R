SOFIA, June 27 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's third largest lender, First Investment Bank <5F4.BB>, said on Friday it had not imposed any restrictions on operations following a sharp fall in its share price and increased deposit withdrawals.

"The bank has not restricted any operations," Ivaylo Aleksandrov, a bank spokesman, told Reuters. He said the bank would shortly publish a statement. The bank's share price was down 26.98 percent as of 0931 GMT. It dipped as much as 18 percent on Thursday before ending down 4 percent on the day. Reuters reporters saw dozens of people queuing outside three branches of the bank in central Sofia around midday on Friday.
