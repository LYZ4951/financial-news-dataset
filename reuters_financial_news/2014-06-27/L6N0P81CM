EDINBURGH, June 27 (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Friday, supported by gains in British engine maker Rolls-Royce <RR.L> but still set for its first weekly drop since April.

Rolls Royce gained 1.1 percent after Reuters exclusively reported that Airbus <AIR.PA> is close to a decision to upgrade its A330 with engines provided by the UK-listed company. [ID:nL6N0P7679] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was flat at 1,370.08 by 0706 GMT, leaving it down 1.8 percent for the week. The index looks set to snap a 10-week winning streak, which had been its longest since the middle of 2012. The FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 0.1 percent at 1,370.38 on Thursday, retreating further from a 6-1/2 year high hit last week after U.S. Federal Reserve official James Bullard suggested the U.S. economy would be strong enough to bear a rate rise in early 2015.
