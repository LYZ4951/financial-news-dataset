ATHENS/LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Greece's fourth-largest lender Alpha Bank <ACBr.AT> plans to securitise about 1.0 billion euros ($1.36 billion) of shipping portfolio loans this summer, expecting to raise about 500 million euros, banking sources told Reuters on Friday.

The transaction will be mainly arranged by Citigroup <C.N>, one source familiar with the deal said. Citi declined to comment. "We are working on a plan to securitise about 1 billion euros worth of shipping portfolio loans, aiming to conclude the deal in the summer," a senior Alpha banker said, declining to be named. "The securitisation will get us funding of about 500 million euros. The bonds will have a five-year maturity and will be privately placed," the banker added.
