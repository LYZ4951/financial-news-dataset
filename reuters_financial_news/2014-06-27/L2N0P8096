NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - The index business is a big business, so it's not for nothing that the London Stock Exchange agreed on Thursday to buy Frank Russell Co and its Russell Indexes.

Those indexes are benchmarked to more than $5 trillion in index funds and puts the LSE in the third position behind S&P Dow Jones and MSCI in the ETF world as well, a lucrative business that involves using their well-known indexes like the Russell 2000 and its "value" and "growth" versions into a multitude of funds.  The iShares Russell 2000 ETF is generally in the top five in terms of daily trading volume among ETFs, and the Direxion triple-short Russell ETF hovers around the top 10; several other leveraged ETFs linked to the small-cap index are big ones too, and we haven't even gotten to all of the regular funds that index to the Russell.  With that in mind the market awaits the big rebalancing of Russell Indexes which will cross at the end of the day in a massive trade (Credit Suisse estimates about $42 billion in trading on the "cross," that is, the moment when everything rebalances all at once in an event that sometimes seems like it should be a Y2K-style debacle, only it isn't).  Of course, big index desks have been preparing for this for months, with some of the preliminary trading to position for companies they expect to see a bigger weighting even starting as early as January. Credit Suisse notes that some index trading desks likely make most of their profit-and-loss for the year as a result of this trade.  That said, this year's notable additions to the Russell 1000 index are a bit underwhelming: Tyco has come back to the fold not long after being banished due to domicile concerns, while Ally Financial and CBS Outdoor Americas are also among those coming into the index.  The Tyco addition will produce a trade of about $648.3 million, the largest of the day, and significant buying will also be notable in Twitter and Facebook - $495.6 million and $452.8 million, respectively, ranking them fourth and fifth. Those two stocks are seeing their share in the Russell 1000 increase as well - explaining the adjustment there.
