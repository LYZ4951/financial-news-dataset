BUDAPEST, June 27 (Reuters) - Hungary's government submitted legislation to parliament on Friday, declaring that several costs banks had charged foreign currency and forint borrowers were unfair, implementing a recent Supreme Court ruling for all clients involved.

The draft bill published on parliament's website says the exchange rate spread applied in foreign currency loan contracts, banks using different rates when disbursing loans and when calculating monthly repayments, was void.  The bill, subject to approval by lawmakers, orders a recalculation of spreads within 90 days of the law taking effect based on the central bank's official exchange rates.
