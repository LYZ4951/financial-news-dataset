NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday called Argentina's decision to send payment on sovereign debt in defiance of a court order an "explosive action" and told Bank of New York Mellon to return the money to the government.

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Griesa reminded lawyers representing Argentina and BNY Mellon that "any attempt to make payment to the exchange bondholders without complying with (my order to pay NML concurrently) is illegal." Griesa met with lawyers representing Argentina as well as holdout investors, led by Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, regarding the Latin American nation's decision on Thursday to deposit money with BNY Mellon intended only for bondholders who participated in two sovereign debt exchanges in 2005 and 2010. Argentina was ordered to pay the holdouts $1.33 billion plus interest on unrestructured bonds stemming from the country's $100 billion default in 2001-2002.
