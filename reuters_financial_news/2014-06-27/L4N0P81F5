June 27 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets fell on Friday, mostly led by banks, on concerns over a sluggish global economy after data showed lower-than-expected consumer spending and weak first-quarter growth in the United States.

U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in May, prompting economists to downgrade estimates for second-quarter growth, following weak first-quarter GDP data. [ID:nL2N0P70HW]  Jakarta <.JKSE> hit a more-than seven-week low, Thai shares <.SETI> retreated by midday after gaining to their highest since Oct. 21, Singapore <.FTSTI> fell from a one-week high hit in the previous session, and Malaysia <.KLSE> touched a one-week low.  "With the uncertainty on Wall Street overnight and the lack of fresh positive prospects, we expect the local bourse to also see some profit-taking ahead of the weekend," Singapore-based Net Research Asia said in a investor note.  Bank Central Asia Tbk PT <BBCA.JK> was down 1.8 percent, Public Bank Bhd <PUBM.KL> traded 1.4 percent weaker, and Bangkok Bank PCL <BBL.BK> was down 0.8 percent, dragging down their overall stock indices respectively.  In Bangkok, analysts said while end-of-quarter window dressing would continue to drive the market forward, the upside would be limited for Thai stocks while the market awaited clarity on an energy reform plan from the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) by the end of the month.  "We expect a trading range of 1470-1485 points for the SET index today. In our view, the best strategy to use at the moment is still to sell the rallies and buy the pullbacks within the above trading range," said Bangkok-based Phillip Securities.  The energy sector should remain under pressure in the short term due to concerns on energy price reform, Maybank Kim Eng Securities said in a note.  "The most appropriate solution, in our view, is liberalising domestic energy prices and subsidies for only certain groups of people."  For Asian companies click [ID:nTOPEQA]
