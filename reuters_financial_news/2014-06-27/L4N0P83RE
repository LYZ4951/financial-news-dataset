June 27 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ghana's sovereign rating to "B2" from "B1", citing the African country's rising debt burden and deteriorating debt affordability.

"The rating agency expects public debt to exceed 65 percent of GDP by the end of 2015 from 55.7 percent in 2013, mirrored by rising interest expenses relative to government revenues," Moody's said.
