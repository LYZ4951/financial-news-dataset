MUMBAI, June 27 (Reuters) - India's Ranbaxy Laboratories <RANB.NS> rose 5.8 percent in early trading after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it had approved the company's generic version of Novartis AG's <NOVN.VX> blood pressure drug Diovan. [ID:nL2N0P71KH]

Investors say current market size of Diovan in the United States is $1.7 billion and Ranbaxy can generate revenue of over $200 million from generic Diovan sales as it enjoys 180 days exclusivity for the same. Also, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd <SUN.NS>, which in April agreed to buy Ranbaxy, rose 2.5 percent as well on hopes that drugs such as Diovan and Nexium would reduce its effective cost of acquiring Ranabxy.
