BERLIN, June 27 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday he dislikes current low interest rates which are no longer able to fulfill their economic function and urged central banks to find a way to reduce excess liquidity.

"I have often said it before and I repeat it - I don't like these low interest rates, they are too low," Schaeuble said.
