June 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed People's Merchant Finance PLC 's <PMB.CM> (PMF) National Long-Term rating at 'BB+lka'. The Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS - NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT  PMF's rating reflects Fitch's expectation that support would be forthcoming from  its main shareholder, state-owned People's Bank (PB; 'AA+(lka)'/Stable), if  required. PB has a 36% effective shareholding in PMF, directly and via PB's  subsidiary People's Leasing & Finance PLC <PEOP.CM> ('AA-(lka)'/Stable). Fitch's view of  support is also based on PMF's association with, and consequent reputational  risk to, PB's franchise given the common brand identity, PB's representation on  PMF's board and support demonstrated by PB in the form of borrowings and equity  injections. Nevertheless, there is a multiple notch differential between PMF's  and PB's ratings, taking into account PMF's relatively less important role in  and lower integration with the group's overall operations.  RATING SENSITIVITIES- NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT  PMF's rating may be downgraded if there is any change to PB's ability or  propensity to extend support. This may stem from a change to PB's National  Long-Term Rating or a material weakening of linkages with PB, such as a dilution  of PB's effective shareholding or board control.   PMF's standalone profile is very weak and characterised by continuing operating  losses, deteriorating asset quality, and a thin loss-absorption capacity.  The company made a pre- impairment operating loss of LKR6.7m in FY14 as a result  of lower net interest margins and high operating costs. PMF also incurred  significant loan impairment charges of 3% of average loans in FY14. This stemmed  from a further weakening of PMF's asset quality along with a challenging  macroeconomic environment, which has affected its largely subprime customer  base. Fitch believes that PMF's loan book could face further asset quality  stress unless risk management is strengthened.  PMF's funding is predominantly from term deposits, which, although improving,  remains concentrated. Fitch expects liquidity support from PB to be forthcoming  if required.
