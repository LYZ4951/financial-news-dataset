WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock <BLK.N> disclosed on Friday that it may be facing possible civil charges by U.S. securities regulators over disclosures tied to a former portfolio manager whose personal investments raised the perception of a possible conflict.

In a regulatory filing, BlackRock said its BlackRock Advisors LLC unit had received a "Wells Notice" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating the SEC is leaning toward possibly filing an enforcement action.
