June 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The Bank of England's [BKENG.UL] decision yesterday to set  restrictions on mortgage borrowing is a tentative first step in using  macro-prudential tools to temper the credit cycle, Fitch Ratings says. The BoE  is testing its tools in the mortgage market, but the policies are likely to have  limited impact on lenders in the short term. The new affordability test and income multiple cap are relatively low-impact  tools for the Financial Policy Committee. No loan-to-value cap or risk-weight  floor has been introduced and the countercyclical buffer is set at 0%, so the  policies do not give the banking system additional ability to absorb future  mortgage losses as such.  The FPC does not believe household indebtedness poses an imminent threat to  stability, so its recommendations are pre-emptive. The measures are aimed at  reducing the risk of a rise in the number of highly indebted households, and so  have more to do with positioning the economy for forthcoming interest rate rises  than protecting the banking sector directly. We do not expect material changes to banks' mortgage originations from the  measures, over and above the mortgage market review requirements. The  requirement to stress test affordability at 3 percentage points above the  interest rate level for five years is already in line with lenders' existing  practice, as they factor in a rising rate scenario. The affordability test is  therefore likely to affect mortgage origination more when interest rates  increase.  The cap on restricting loans with high income multiples (above 4.5x) to no more  than 15% of a bank's total number of new mortgage loans is unlikely to constrain  most lenders. The proportion of new mortgages to borrowers with loan to income  (LTI) greater than 4.5x rose to an average of 11% in 1Q14, according to the BoE,  and so was within the limit. Buy to let, lifetime mortgage, equity release,  second charge and further advances are excluded from the restriction.  But there may be shifts in banks' portfolio mix. Regional differences mean that  London borrowers may be affected because 19% of their loans fall into the high  LTI category, according to data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Lenders  have historically allowed higher LTIs for higher-income borrowers, but the 15%  limit based on number of loans means a lender might decide to ration its high  LTI lending in favour of those borrowers at the expense of lower-income  customers. The cap does not appear to differentiate between single- and  dual-income couples either, even though joint-income mortgages are typically  extended at lower multiples.  The FPC has the powers and tools to require additional buffers for banks to  offset any rise in risks from housing market growth partly fuelled by  help-to-buy and funding-for-lending schemes. It could increase the  countercyclical buffer or introduce a higher leverage ratio requirement. We  believe the FPC will test its powers gradually, tweaking the caps and bringing  in new tools according to market developments.
