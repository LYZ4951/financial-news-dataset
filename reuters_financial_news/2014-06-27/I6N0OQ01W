MILAN, June 27 (Reuters) - The initial public offering of shares in Fineco, the online broker of Italian lender UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, has been three times subscribed, two sources close to the deal said on Friday.

Fineco has priced its IPO at 3.7 euros per share at the bottom end of a revised price range in what is Italy's second-biggest market listing so far this year. [ID:nL6N0P815T] "It has been covered three times. (Fineco) is a success story which is easy to tell and that has helped selling shares," one of the sources told Reuters.
