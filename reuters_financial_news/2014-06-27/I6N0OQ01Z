MILAN, June 27 (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> said on Friday it had raised 4.99 billion euros ($6.81 billion) through the sale of new shares, boosting its capital base and increasing the chances it could pass an EU review of bank assets.

In a statement, the Tuscan-bank, said the highly-dilutive rights issue was 99.85 percent subscribed, adding that unsubscribed rights will be offered on the market July 1-7. "It's a positive result for the bank and the state," Chief Executive Fabrizio Viola said in the statement.
