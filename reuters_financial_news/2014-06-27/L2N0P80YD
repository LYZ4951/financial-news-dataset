WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc <BARC.L> has tapped the law firm WilmerHale to help the bank defend itself against allegations that it deceived investors in its "dark pool" trading venue, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the attorneys working with Barclays is Matthew Martens, a former top litigator at the Securities and Exchange Commission who is perhaps best known for leading the SEC to victory in its high-profile civil fraud trial against former Goldman Sachs <GS.N> Vice President Fabrice "Fabulous Fab" Tourre, the sources said.
