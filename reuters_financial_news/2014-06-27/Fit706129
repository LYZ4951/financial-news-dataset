June 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sterling Insurance Co Ltd's  (SICL) and Sterling Life Ltd's (SLL) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings at  'BBB+'. The Outlooks are Stable. The companies are the underwriting members of  the UK-based Sterling Insurance Group Limited (together referred to as  Sterling).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation is based on Sterling's supportive risk-adjusted capitalisation  and improved underwriting profitability. However, Sterling's ratings remain  constrained by its limited scale and operating profile.  Sterling is a niche UK insurance company that has established a recognisable  franchise with a strong distribution network. However, with GBP155m of gross  written premiums in 2013, it remains a small player in a competitive market. Its  relatively small scale and concentration in the UK market make it more difficult  for Sterling to control pricing, access external finance and absorb a potential  fall in demand for its products. Fitch expects SICL's and SLL's levels of risk-adjusted capitalisation to remain  stable and supportive of the rating. In 2013, regulatory solvency was 139% and  194% for SICL and SLL, respectively. Sterling's net income continued its positive trend and increased to GBP6.1m in  2013 (2012: 4.5m, 2011: GBP3.6m), underpinned by robust technical results and a  strong investment return. This also includes GBP1m of income from Sterling's  administration business which is expected to reduce over the next 12- 24 months  as this business winds down naturally.  Non-life technical profitability was strong in 2013, reflected in an improved  Fitch-calculated combined ratio of 96.7% (2012: 98.6%). Losses from the storms  and floods of December 2013 and January 2014 are expected to fall broadly within  Sterling's usual allowance for weather-related losses. Fitch expects this  positive trend to continue in the absence of significant weather-related losses  in 2H14. The performance of the life business remained relatively stable,  contributing GBP699,000 to the 2013 technical results (2012: GBP908,000).   RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch considers an upgrade unlikely in the medium term given the company's  limited scale and operating profile.
