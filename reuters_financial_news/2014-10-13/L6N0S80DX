MOSCOW, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Monday that it had conducted 34.64 billion roubles ($858 million) worth of forex interventions to defend the rouble on Oct. 9.

The central bank releases its interventions data with a two-day lag. The rouble <RUB=> has been sliding on falling oil prices and broad risk aversion towards Russia because of its role in the Ukraine crisis.
