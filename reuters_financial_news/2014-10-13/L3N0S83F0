Oct 13 (Reuters) - Asset manager F&C Investments said it hired Georg Kyd-Rebenburg from AllianceBernstein to head its European wholesale distribution and increase its continental Europe coverage.

Kyd-Rebenburg's appointment is effective Monday and he will be based in its Munich office, said F&C, which is a part of BMO Financial Group's <BMO.TO> BMO Global Asset Management. Kyd-Rebenburg has almost 30 years' experience and has been with AllianceBernstein since 1996, latterly as its country head for Germany and Austria, responsible for wholesale distribution. At F&C he will play a key role in its continental European distribution strategy and will lead the drive to expand its wholesale presence, the asset manager said in a statement.
