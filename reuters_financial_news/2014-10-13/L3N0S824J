SEOUL, Oct 13 (Reuters) - South Korean shares fell on Monday as tech shares underperformed, though losses were pared by bargain-hunting after the benchmark index touched a seven-month low as soon as the session began.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> fell 0.71 percent to close at 1,927.21 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> firmed slightly against the dollar, consolidating modest gains after the release of unexpectedly strong September trade data from China, South Korea's largest export market.
