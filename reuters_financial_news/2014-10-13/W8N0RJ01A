WARSAW, Oct 13 (Reuters) - It would be good for the Polish central bank to wait with further decisions on interest rates after the deeper-than-expected rate cut in October, rate-setter Elzbieta Chojna-Duch was quoted as saying on Monday.

"One has to stress that the October rate cut was deeper than expected. It would be good if we reserved some time now to assess its effects," Chojna-Duch told state news agency PAP.
