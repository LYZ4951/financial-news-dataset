PARIS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - French low-cost telecom operator Iliad <ILD.PA> said on Monday it had abandoned its attempt to buy T-Mobile US <TMUS.N> because owner Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> and certain board members had refused to consider its bid.

The company had set a mid-October deadline to decide whether to improve its bid or walk away, several people familiar with the situation told Reuters last month. [ID:nL6N0RK51C] "The Iliad group announces that it puts an end to its project of acquiring T-Mobile US, following exchanges with Deutsche Telekom and selected board members of T-Mobile US who have refused to entertain its new offer," Iliad said in a statement. Shares in T-Mobile US fell 3.8 percent to $26.59 after the announcement.
