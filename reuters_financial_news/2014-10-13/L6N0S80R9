LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European shares skidded lower on Monday, extending last week's losing streak, as concerns about faltering global economic growth hit equity markets across the world.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which had already fallen for the last four sessions, was down by 0.6 percent at 1,285.31 points by 0705 GMT, with Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> falling to a new one-year low. European stock markets have been hit by a raft of weak economic data, and on Friday credit rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on France to "negative" from "stable". [ID:nL3N0S55HX]
