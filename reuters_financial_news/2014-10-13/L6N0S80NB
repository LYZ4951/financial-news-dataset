MOSCOW, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Monday it had shifted the boundaries of its floating rouble corridor by 25 kopecks, following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline.

As of Oct. 10, the new corridor extended from 36.25 to 45.25 against a dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX>, compared with 36.00 to 45.00 previously.
