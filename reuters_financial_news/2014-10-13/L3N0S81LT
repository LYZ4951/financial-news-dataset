BANGKOK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Thailand's Tisco Financial Group <TISCO.BK> reported a 4 percent drop in third-quarter net profit on Monday, hit by higher  provision expenses and weak domestic car sales.

The group, which owns Tisco Bank, one of Thailand's top three car loan providers, posted a July-September net profit of 1.09 billion baht ($34 million), slightly higher than the 1.04 billion baht average forecast by five analysts polled by Reuters.  This compared with 1.13 billion baht a year earlier and 952 million baht from the previous quarter.
