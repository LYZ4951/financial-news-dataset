MOSCOW, Oct 13 (Reuters) - There are no systemic risks arising from the shaken foreign currency position of Russian banks and companies, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Monday.

Sanctions on Moscow for its role in the Ukrainian crisis that have limited access to Western capital and falling oil prices have created a shortage of foreign currencies on the domestic market in recent weeks.
