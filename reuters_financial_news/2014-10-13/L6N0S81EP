LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European stock markets turned positive on Monday, recovering from earlier losses, with airline stocks such as Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> and Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> boosted by a further drop in the oil price.

The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> was up by 0.2 percent. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> also advanced by 0.2 percent, although the DAX remained near one-year lows, while both France's CAC <.FCHI> and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> were up 0.1 percent. Lufthansa was the best-performing DAX stock in percentage terms, rising by 3 percent while Air France KLM also progressed by a similar amount, as Brent crude oil - a major cost for airlines - fell below $88 a barrel, its lowest in almost four years.
