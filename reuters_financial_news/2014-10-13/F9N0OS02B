MUNICH, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet said on Monday he expected a financial health check the European Central Bank is conducting of top banks in Europe to return confidence to the sector.

"I am very confident that the AQR/stress test will bring back confidence in the banking sector in Europe," Praet said during a presentation to an economics conference in Munich. The ECB will release on Oct. 26 the results of the review of European banks' health, designed to offer the clearest picture yet of the state of a sector that was pummelled during the financial crisis.
