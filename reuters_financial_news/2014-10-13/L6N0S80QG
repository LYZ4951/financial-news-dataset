AMSTERDAM, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Pershing Square <PSH.AS>, a fund run by activist investor Bill Ackman, opened down 2 percent on their debut on Monday on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange.

The fund was initially priced at $25 a share, giving it a market capitalisation of $6.2 billion. It was trading at $24.26 at 0905 GMT. The fund boosts the firepower of billionaire Ackman, famed for aggressive moves such as a $1 billion bet against U.S. nutrition firm Herbalife and a battle to broker a sale of Botox maker Allergan <AGN.N> to Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.TO>.
