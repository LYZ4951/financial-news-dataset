SOFIA, Oct 13 (Reuters) - These are some of the main stories in Bulgarian newspapers on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

-- Interim Prime Minister Georgi Bliznashki said Bulgaria should have either a center-right alliance or a grand coalition. He dismissed as "depleted" any scenarios of an expert or program government, describing them as a stage through which Bulgaria "has already gone", referring to the tenure of former Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski (Trud, 24 Chasa). -- Radan Kanev, one of the right-wing Reformist Bloc's leaders, admitted that its attempt to set out conditions about who will be Prime Minister in the next government was a mistake (Presa, Standart).
