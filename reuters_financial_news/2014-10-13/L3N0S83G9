COLOMBO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks fell more than 2 percent on Monday to their lowest in nearly four weeks on profit-taking, with banking stocks leading the decline.

The main stock index <.CSE> fell to 2.03 percent before closing down 1.87 percent, or 136.78 points, at 7,184.22, its lowest since Sept. 17. It hit a near 3-1/2 year closing high on Oct. 3. "It's a free fall. Today the fall is led by banking and large-cap shares," said Dimantha Mathew, manager, research at First Capital Equities (Pvt) Ltd. First Capital Research in a note to investors said it expects selling pressure to continue for the next few days mainly stemming from large-cap counters. Biggest listed lender Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc <COMB.CM>, which led the overall fall, lost 5.92 percent to 157.30 rupees, while DFCC Bank Plc <DFCC.CM> shed 6.27 percent to 215.40 rupees.
