HONG KONG, Oct 13 (Reuters) - China's Agile Property Holdings Ltd <3383.HK> is in talks with banks to extend a remaining bridge loan, the company said on an analyst briefing call on Monday.

Shares in the Hong Kong-listed property developer slumped by more than a fifth as trading in the stock resumed following news last week that it withdrew a rights issue and that its chairman Chen Zhuo Lin had been required by the Kunming City prosecutor to stay at "a designated residence" since late on Sept 30.
