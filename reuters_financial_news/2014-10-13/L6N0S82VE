DUBAI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Banque Saudi Fransi <1050.SE>, the lender part-owned by Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA>, posted a 35.2 percent rise in its third-quarter net profit, according to a bourse statement on Monday, beating analyst forecasts.

The kingdom's fourth-largest listed bank by assets said it made 926 million riyals ($246.9 million) in the three months ending September 30, compared with 685 million riyals in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expected the bank to post an average net profit of 831.1 million riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0S20O4] The bank attributed its rise to an increase in total operating income, which rose 15.8 percent year-on-year to 1.49 billion riyals, without elaborating. Saudi companies issue brief earnings statements early in the reporting period before publishing more detailed results later.
