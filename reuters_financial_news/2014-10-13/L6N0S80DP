DUBAI, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Dubai's Shuaa Capital <SHUA.DU> third-quarter net profit increased six-fold due to improved performance from its asset management and investment banking businesses, it said in a statement on Monday.

Net profit in the three months ending Sept. 30 jumped to 26.2 million dirhams ($7.13 million), compared to 3.6 million dirhams in the same period a year ago.  The company attributed the growth to an increased level of activity in asset management, investment banking, capital markets and lending.
