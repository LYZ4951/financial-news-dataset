LONDON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland's <RBS.L> private bank Coutts has set aside 110 million pounds ($182 million) to compensate customers for unsuitable investment advice, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

RBS said earlier in August that Coutts had decided to examine the suitability of investment advice to its clients following a review into Britain's wealth management industry by the country's financial regulator.
