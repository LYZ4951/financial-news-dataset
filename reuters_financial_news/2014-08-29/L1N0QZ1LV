BOGOTA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.50 percent on Friday, in an effort to head off inflation as the economy expands more quickly than expected. It was the fifth straight month in which the bank has raised rates.

The following is a translation by Reuters of the bank's statement accompanying the decision:  At its meeting today the board of directors of the Central Bank decided to increase the interest rate by 25 basis points, and set it at 4.5 percent. For this decision, the Board took into consideration the following aspects: It is estimated that the Colombian economy will grow about 5 percent in 2014, driven by strong domestic demand. The unemployment rate continues to drop in a context of strong growth in salaried employment. In the first half of the year, economic growth in Colombia's trading partners was lower than expected. However, it is expected that there will be more dynamic external demand in coming quarters, supported in particular by the economic recovery in the United States.  The decline in oil production over the previous year and the decline in international oil prices imply a reduction in revenue from this source that can affect the behavior of domestic demand. In July, the annual consumer inflation rose 10 basis points to stand at 2.89 percent. In contrast, the average of the four core inflation indicators monitored by the Bank declined for the second consecutive month and was 2.58 percent. Inflation forecasts for December, the end of the year, and coming years are about 3 percent. Annual growth of bank credit has declined in the last two months despite the fact that increases in the benchmark interest rate for lending and borrowing rates have been low.  In short, the economy is adjusting to the change in stance of monetary policy begun in March. It is hoped that with this increase of 25 basis points, the interest rate will keep inflation expectations close to the target of 3 percent and economic activity at its potential level.
