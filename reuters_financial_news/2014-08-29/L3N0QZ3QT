SEOUL, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Housing prices across South Korea have extended a rising streak into the 12th month, with their annual growth at the highest in two years, data from the country's top mortgage lender showed on Friday.

The index has risen every month since falling by 0.04 percent in August last year. Annual growth in August this year was the highest since a 1.90 percent rise in August 2012, the data showed.
