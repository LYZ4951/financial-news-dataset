MOSCOW, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Russian truck maker Kamaz <KMAZ.MM> said on Friday it had made a 1.5-billion-rouble ($40.5 million) net loss in the first half of 2014 after recording a profit of 2.6 billion roubles a year ago.

Kamaz, in which Germany's Daimler <DAIGn.DE> owns 15 percent, also reported a 10 percent slump in revenue to 47.6 billion roubles as costs increased while demand faltered.
