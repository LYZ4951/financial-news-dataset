ATHENS, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Greece will auction 875 million euros ($1.15 billion) of six-month treasury bills on September 2 to refinance a maturing issue, the country's debt agency (PDMA) said on Friday.

Athens has a stock of about 15 billion euros of T-bills that it regularly refinances. Greece sold six-month treasury paper priced to yield 2.02 percent in August. The settlement date will be September 5. Only primary dealers will be allowed to participate and no commission will be paid.
