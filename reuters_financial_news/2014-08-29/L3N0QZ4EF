Aug 29 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's raised its rating on Chicago's senior-lien wastewater debt outstanding to 'AA' from 'AA-minus', citing the city's efforts to improve its financial position.

The city is "addressing its capital needs in a timely fashion and still maintains rates that will not stress its service base," Standard & Poor's credit analyst Corey Friedman said.
