TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Japan's $1.2 trillion public pension fund said on Friday that it had pulled almost $22 billion from investments in Japanese government bonds and other yen bonds in the second quarter, with the money shifting largely to cash and foreign investments.

The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), under pressure from the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to shift money into higher-risk assets and out of low-yielding Japanese government bonds, reduced its yen bond holdings to just under the 52 percent minimum suggested by its conservative, JGB-centered portfolio model. The quarterly investment result marked the first time that GPIF has allowed its investment allocations to shift beyond the limits set by its model portfolio, which officials are now working to overhaul. The fund has 5 to 8 percentage points of leeway on either side of its model portfolio weightings.
