LONDON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - British house prices rose during August at a much faster monthly pace than expected, according to a survey on Friday that contrasted with other signs of cooling in the housing market.

Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices rose 0.8 percent on the month in August compared with a 0.2 percent rise in July. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.1 percent.
