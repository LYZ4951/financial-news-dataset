SAO PAULO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - BR Partners Banco de Investimento SA is opening a unit focused on corporate debt restructuring as a recession, rising borrowing costs and eroding confidence in Brazil are hampering a handful of sectors, executives at the investment-banking firm said on Friday.

For BR Partners, which was founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> dealmaker Ricardo Lacerda in 2009, the move makes sense because debt restructuring fits well into some of the São Paulo-based firm's specialties, such as mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring advisory. The division will be headed by Claudio Kier Citrin, a former FleetBoston Corp and Citigroup Inc <C.N> banker, Lacerda said in an interview. The restructuring unit allows BR Partners to make a better use of resoruces by assigning analysts and bankers working on M&A deals to refinancing and debt default cases, said Andrea Pinheiro, a senior partner at BR Partners. "For clients, it's a great opportunity because we offer a larger and better platform than boutiques, we can perform more complex tasks such as fundraising, and we can remain independent and free of any conflicts of interest," Citrin said in the same interview. Growing caution among private-sector banks as the economy slipped into recession in the second quarter has made it harder for some companies to refinance existing loans or obtain new ones. While Citrin declined to single out specific sectors or clients, he said "the unit's pipeline has gotten busier." Bankers have pointed to the end of a five-year long credit cycle and the recent start of a refinancing phase as the reason why sugar, farming, oil and gas equipment and industrial companies are seeking to reorganize their debt. With Brazil's $2.3 trillion economy struggling, a flurry of renegotiations looks inevitable in some sectors. With interest rates nearing a three-year high, companies in those sectors are moving to cut debt. To do that, they are hiring independent advisers such as BR Partners or investment banking boutiques that can help minimize costs associated with refinancing and work for better repayment terms from lenders. Sugar and ethanol, industrial and power companies are incurring extra expenses when repaying loans, paying a surcharge equal to 2 percent or 3 percent of the value of their debt, according to a survey by financial consulting firm Mark 2 Market. Borrowers' lack of knowledge of how banking contracts work usually works against them, fanning debt-servicing costs. The restructuring business also provides BR Partners with a buffer against flagging capital markets and financial advisory activity in Brazil, said Lacerda, also a former co-head of Latin America investment banking at Citigroup.
