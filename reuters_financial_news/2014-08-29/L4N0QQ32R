KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 (Reuters) - CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL>, Malaysia's second biggest lender, posted a 10 percent fall in quarterly net profit, hurt by a weak performance in Indonesia.

Net profit for the second-quarter dropped to 949.9 million ringgit ($300 million) from 1.05 billion ringgit for the same period a year ago, while revenue was flat at 3.4 billion ringgit, it said in a statement.  First-half net income slid 17 percent to 2.02 billion ringgit. "Indonesia will remain the biggest challenge in the second half due to prevailing economic and liquidity factors," CIMB said in a statement. The bank is in talks with smaller local rivals RHB Capital <RHBC.KL> and Malaysia Building Society <MBSS.KL> on a planned mega merger to become Malaysia's largest banking group, overtaking Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) <MBBM.KL>.
