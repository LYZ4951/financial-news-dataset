HAMBURG, Aug 29 (Reuters) - German state-backed lender HSH Nordbank [HSH.UL] on Friday said it is confident of its capital cushion but could not exclude a risk of falling short in a European Central Bank test of the landesbank's ability to withstand financial shocks.

"HSH Nordbank has a resilient capital base with which it is well prepared for the ECB's Comprehensive Assessment and the related Asset Quality Review as well as the stress test," the lender said in a statement on its half-year results. HSH has a heavy exposure to the troubled market for shipping loans that analysts have said would make the tests particularly challenging. The lender said its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - a measure of its capital strength - stood at 12.8 percent at the end of June, including the effect of a loss guarantee buffer provided by its state owners, worth 2.8 percentage points.
