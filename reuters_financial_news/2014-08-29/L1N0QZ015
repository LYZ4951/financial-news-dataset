Aug 28 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N> plans to seek a buyer for its medical device maker business, Cordis Corp, The Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.

The sale of Cordis could fetch between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, one of the people told the Journal, adding that the sales process for the business was still at an early stage. (http://on.wsj.com/1AYRKBY)  When contacted, J&J declined to comment on the matter. Bridgewater, New Jersey based Cordis manufactures treatments for vascular disease including stents and catheters. It has a workforce of about 5000 employees. Earlier this year, J&J sold another of its units, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc to private-equity firm Carlyle Group <CG.O> for $4.15 billion. Analysts had pointed out at that time that the move highlighted J&J's determination not to waste resources on unloved divisions.[ID:nL3N0KQ3U0]
