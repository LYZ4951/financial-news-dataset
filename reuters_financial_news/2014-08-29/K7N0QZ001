KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Malaysian state fund Khazanah plans to push a parliamentary bill to amend contracts between Malaysia Airlines (MAS) <MASM.KL> and its suppliers, aiming to avoid having to go through law courts, Khazanah Managing director Azman Mokhtar said on Friday.

Amending or cancelling MAS' long-term contracts is part of a 6 billion ringgit ($1.90 billion) restructuring plan announced by Khazanah [KHAZA.UL]. The plan includes cutting 30 percent of its workforce and de-listing the firm by the end of this year. Khazanah said it aims to return the airline to profitability within three years of its de-listing, and plans to re-list the carrier in three to five years from now.
