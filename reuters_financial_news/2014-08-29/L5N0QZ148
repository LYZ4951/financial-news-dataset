ZURICH, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Swiss private bank Notenstein is to buy the client assets of Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg's (LLBW) Swiss wealth management arm, it said on Friday, in the continuing gradual consolidation of the Swiss banking sector.

Swiss wealth manager LBBW has about 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.09 billion) in assets under management and Notenstein, which is owned by Swiss lender Raiffeisen, said it expected to take on most of these assets.  A spokeswoman for Notenstein declined to disclose the price of the deal and said that the bank planned to take on a handful of LBBW's client advisory staff as part of the transaction, without elaborating further. A Notenstein statement said that it expects to conclude the deal in the fourth quarter of this year.  Some experts expect the Swiss banking sector to shrink by around a third in the coming years as higher regulatory costs push smaller players to sell up or close down.  Julius Baer <BAER.VX>, which has been an active acquirer, said last month that it would buy the private banking activities of Israel's Bank Leumi <LUMI.TA> in Luxembourg and Switzerland for up to 70 million francs.
