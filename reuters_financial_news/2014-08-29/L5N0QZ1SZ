SOFIA, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Depositors at Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> may get partial access to their funds at the troubled bank in September, Interim Finance Minister Rumen Porozhanov said on Friday.

"We debated issues of partial access to deposits as of next month," Porozhanov told the local channel bTV after meeting with European Commission's delegation in Sofia. Bulgaria's fourth-largest lender was hit by a run on deposits in June that led to Bulgaria's biggest banking crisis since the 1990s.
