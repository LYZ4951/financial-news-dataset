SEOUL, Aug 29 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged lower on Friday to snap a four-day winning streak, as renewed fighting in Ukraine dashed investor appetite in risky, emerging market equities.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> fell 0.35 percent to close at 2,068.54 points, drifting 0.37 percent lower for the month of August. The South Korean won <KRW=>, coming off a 7-week intraday high on Thursday, firmed by a hair's breadth as investors hoped that new stimulus measures by the European Central Bank would bring in a fresh wave of investments into emerging markets.
