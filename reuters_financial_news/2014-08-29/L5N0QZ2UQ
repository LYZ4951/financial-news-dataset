JOHANNESBURG, Aug 29 (Reuters) - South Africa's Woolworths <WHLJ.J> plans to raise 10 billion rand ($940 million) through a rights offer to help repay financing for its acquisition of Australia's David Jones, the company said on Friday.

Woolworths, an upscale retailer of food and clothing, this month finalised its A$2.2 billion ($2 billion) purchase of Australia's second-largest apparel retailer to create a global player focused on the southern hemisphere. [ID:nL4N0PS34Z] The deal was partly financed by short-term funding from banks, including Citigroup <C.N>, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and Standard Bank <SBKJ.J>, which needs to be repaid, Woolworths said in a regulatory filing. The company said it plans to release details of the rights offer on Tuesday, with the offer to close on September 26.
