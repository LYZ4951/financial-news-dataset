Aug 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index ended flat on Friday after three successive days of losses, supported partly by strength in mainland markets although lackluster corporate earnings capped gains.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> reversed the morning's losses to end flat at 24,742.06 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent.
