April 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Mercurius Funding  N.V./S.A. Compartment Mercurius-1's EUR1,877,404,672 class A notes at 'A+sf'  with a Stable Outlook. The transaction is a static cash flow securitisation of a portfolio of loans  granted to Belgian SMEs and self-employed individuals and originated by Belfius  Bank N.V./S.A. (Belfius; A-/Negative/F1). The EUR2.7bn portfolio is highly  granular and consists of 36,480 loans to 25,804 borrower groups of SMEs and  self-employed individuals. The top obligor group represents 0.49% of the  portfolio and the top 10 obligor groups 3.3%.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the notes' available credit enhancement and the stable  performance of the EUR2.7bn underlying portfolio, which is in line with Fitch's  expectations.  Arrears have remained fairly low (three-months-plus arrears stood at 0.5% of the  current portfolio balance as of end-February 2014). Since closing, 377 loans  (representing 2.6% of the initial portfolio balance) were repurchased by  Belfius. A part of these repurchases was due to mortgage mandate conversions;  before the Mobilisation Law in Belgium of August 2012, mortgage mandates could  not be converted for the benefit of a third-party (and typically SPVs). Credit enhancement, which is provided by subordination and a reserve fund,  totals 33.5% for the class A notes. The reserve fund totalled EUR144m as of  end-February 2014, of which EUR96m provided credit enhancement to the class A  notes. The remaining EUR48m serves as liquidity facility for the class A notes  and does not provide credit enhancement. The notes' rating is capped at 'A+sf', as the transaction's documentation  includes a rating trigger of 'BBB+'/'F2' with regard to the account bank. Under  Fitch's counterparty criteria, a direct support counterparty such as an account  bank, with a Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+' and a Short-Term  IDR of 'F2' can support notes rated up to 'A+sf'.
