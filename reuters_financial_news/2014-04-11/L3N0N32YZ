Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> closed up 1.1 percent, recouping some of the more than 3 percent drop on the previous session as shares of Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> and Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> rebounded after steep losses on Thursday. It was down 0.9 percent on the week. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI>, Malaysia <.KLSE> and Thailand <.SETI> drifted lower on the week after recent rally. The Philippines <.PSI> and Vietnam <.VNI> outperformed, with a weekly gain of 0.6 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. Global equities slipped to a two-week low on Friday as a sell-off on Wall Street led by technology and biotech shares and triggered by concerns that valuations are over stretched spread to Asia and Europe.
