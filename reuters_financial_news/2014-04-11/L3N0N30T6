April 10 (Reuters) - The Justice Department is investigating whether a Citigroup Inc <C.N> unit in California failed to alert the government about suspicious banking transactions along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

U.S. prosecutors want to know why Citigroup did not submit so-called suspicious-activity reports flagging the questionable transactions that in some cases involved suspected drug-cartel members, the newspaper said. (http://r.reuters.com/cur48v) The Justice Department and Citigroup were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours. Last week Reuters reported that Federal authorities have opened a criminal investigation into a $400 million fraud involving Citigroup's Mexican unit. [ID:nL4N0MV3XM]
