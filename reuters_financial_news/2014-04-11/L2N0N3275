April 11 (Reuters) - Global finance officials are agitated that the United States has not ratified reforms to the structure of the International Monetary Fund aimed at giving emerging economy nations a greater voice in the global lender.

On Friday, officials from the Group of 20 leading economies and the representatives for all IMF member nations who met with them gave the United States until year-end to ratify long-delayed reforms to the International Monetary Fund and threatened to move forward without it if it fails to do so. [ID:nL2N0N31FP] The reforms were adopted by the IMF in late 2010, but so far the U.S. Congress has declined to endorse them. The latest effort to do so failed in March when Republicans in the House of Representatives balked at an effort by Democrats in the Senate to include the reforms in a Ukraine aid bill. The following table summarizes some of the changes to the IMF quotas that shift more weight to emerging market countries. It shows the top 20 largest quota holders now and under the reforms:   COUNTRY QUOTA COUNTRY QUOTA  SHARE-CURREN  SHARE-REFORM  T (%) ED (%)  USA   17.661  USA   17.398  JAPAN  6.553  JAPAN  6.461  GERMANY6.107  CHINA  6.390  FRANCE 4.502  GERMANY5.583  UNITED KINGDOM 4.502  FRANCE 4.225  CHINA  3.994  UNITED KINGDOM 4.225  ITALY  3.305  ITALY  3.159  SAUDI ARABIA   2.929  INDIA  2.749  CANADA 2.670  RUSSIA 2.705  RUSSIA 2.493  BRAZIL 2.315  INDIA  2.441  CANADA 2.311  NETHERLANDS2.164  SAUDI ARABIA   2.095  BELGIUM1.931  SPAIN  1.999  BRAZIL 1.782  MEXICO 1.868  SPAIN  1.687  NETHERLANDS1.831  MEXICO 1.520  SOUTH KOREA1.799  SWITZERLAND1.450  AUSTRALIA  1.378  SOUTH KOREA1.411  BELGIUM1.344  AUSTRALIA  1.357  SWITZERLAND1.210  VENEZUELA  1.115  TURKEY 0.977 SOURCE: IMF  For a full IMF analysis of the reforms, please click:
