April 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised Sycomore Selection Responsable's (SSR) Fund Quality Rating to 'Satisfactory' from 'Qualifying'. The fund is France-domiciled and managed by Sycomore Asset Management (Sycomore AM, rated 'High Standards').  KEY RATING DRIVERS The revision is underpinned by the fund's three-year track record (achieved in  February 2014) demonstrating performance consistent with its investment  objectives and style.  Fund Presentation Launched in January 2011, SSR is a long-only eurozone equity fund with EUR113m  of assets at end-March 2014. It invests in companies of all market  capitalisations, under a socially responsible investing (SRI) approach.   Investment Process The fund's investment process combines Sycomore AM's highly-disciplined,  fundamental stock-picking approach, unchanged since the company's inception in  2001, with use of proprietary environment, social and governance (ESG) filters.  The combination allows the fund to exclude stocks vulnerable to ESG risks and to  select those well positioned to seize opportunities related to sustainable  development. A distinctive feature is the depth of this SRI research, primarily  based on management meetings and internal analysis. This process contributes to  the stock selection decisions that drive the fund's market exposure and sector  allocation. The fund has no specific sector or benchmark constraints.  Resources SSR is managed by Lea Dunand-Chatellet, who joined Sycomore AM in 2010 as an SRI  analyst with five years of experience as an SRI research analyst. Cyril Charlot,  a senior portfolio manager who is also one of Sycomore AM's founding partners,  is the backup PM. They are seconded by a junior SRI analyst, as well a new  junior entry-level analyst who has joined the team at end March, to help  maintain database and indicators. Fitch considers this build-up and  strengthening of the team as a positive development.  Track Record Since inception, the fund has stood in the first quintile of its Lipper peer  group, with a cumulative performance of +39.8% (I share), and beats its  benchmark by 16.6% at end March 2014. SRI views on companies have led to  significant sector biases. These have remained stable since the fund's inception  and contributed strongly to the fund's performance in 2012. In 2013, they  negatively affected the relative performance, but were offset by favourable  stock-picking.  Fund Manager Founded in 2001, Sycomore AM is an independent asset management company, 90%  owned by its four founding partners and employees. At end-March 2014, Sycomore  AM had EUR2.3bn of assets under management, of which 80% were in eurozone  long-only equity portfolios.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the investment or operational  processes, or resources dedicated to the fund. A material adverse deviation from  Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could result in a downgrade. The  lead PM for SSR occupies a key role within the ESG analysis and management  philosophy, and her departure could result in a rating review. Conversely, a  longer, robust track record supported by stable or increased resources would  result in an upgrade. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings combine Fitch's experience in qualitative fund  analysis with rankings and performance data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters  company. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings offer an independent, forward-looking  assessment of a fund's key performance and risk attributes and consistency of  longer-term returns, relative to peer group or benchmarks. The ratings focus on  the fund manager's investment process, key fund performance drivers, risk  management, and the quality of the fund's operational infrastructure.
