LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Levels of European secondary share sales have soared to $53.3 billion in 2014, the strongest year-to-date since records began in 1980, weekly Thomson Reuters data showed on Friday.

Follow-on activity, when a listed company sells more shares, rose 52 percent against the same period last year, helped by the $2.1 billion offering from Spanish utility company Iberdrola <IBE.MC> and RSA Insurance Group's <RSA.L> $1.3 billion sale. [ID:nL6N0N21SY]   Other European markets also showed strong activity, with mergers and acquisitions (M&A) up 85 percent to $235.1 billion in the year so far. The $40.1 billion merger between cement producers Holcim <HOLN.VX> and Lafarge <LAFP.PA> is the biggest M&A deal since Glencore's Xstrata <GLEN.L> takeover in 2012. [ID:nL6N0N21VB] Global initial public offerings (IPOs) continued a strong run with the best year to date since 2000, more than doubling on last year to $56.9 billion, the data showed.  Morgan Stanley <MS.N> led the banking league tables for global M&A, while Goldman Sachs <GS.N> was top for global equity and equity-related deals.
