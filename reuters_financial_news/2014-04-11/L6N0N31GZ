OSLO, April 11 (Reuters) - The sale of new Norwegian homes fell by 18 percent in March compared to the same month in 2013, the Norwegian Home Builders' Association said on Friday.

Meanwhile, housing starts for the same period rose by 31 percent. Last year's Easter holiday came in March, while this year it's due in mid-April, which may skew the numbers.
