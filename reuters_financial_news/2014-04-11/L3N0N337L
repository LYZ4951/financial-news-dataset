April 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> reported a 19 percent decline in first-quarter profit as revenue from securities trading fell in a climate of uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery and the Federal Reserve's intentions on interest rates.

Net income fell to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $6.53 billion, or $1.59 per share, in the same quarter of 2013, the biggest U.S. bank said on Friday. [ID:nBw3wT6v2a]
