HANOI, April 11 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> ended down 0.13 percent on Friday, with bargain hunting late in the session narrowing earlier losses, and analysts expected the index to soon rebound.

Most stocks fell, led by property firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> that lost 2.13 percent, followed by dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> that decreased 0.69 percent. But gains in a few blue chips on Friday afternoon reverted earlier losses, including PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's largest listed firm, with a 2.16-percent advance. Shares in food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> rose 1.03 percent after the company projected its net profit in 2014 to rise at least 39 percent from last year, it said in a statement on its website. "Investors have started to pick up shares which have fallen," said analyst Nguyen The Minh at Viet Capital Securities. The index could bounce back soon, lifted by gains in several blue chips, analysts said. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT).  VN Index   600.57   PREV.
