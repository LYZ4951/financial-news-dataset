SEOUL, April 11 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> ended higher against the dollar on Friday to post its biggest weekly percentage gain in more than two years on continued foreign buying in local shares and dollar sales by exporters.

The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,035.0 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.5 percent from Thursday's close at 1,040.2. It was up 1.8 percent from a week ago, the best since early December 2011.
