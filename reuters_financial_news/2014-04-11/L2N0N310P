NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. investors could benefit from China's decision to allow cross-market investing between Shanghai and Hong Kong by buying exchange-traded funds that access China's mainland A-shares market, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note on Friday.

The ability of investors to buy stocks from either exchange more freely may narrow the valuation gap between so-called A-shares, traded in Shanghai, and so-called H-shares, traded in Hong Kong, the analysts note, thus allowing investors to profit from the spread tightening. [ID:nL3T0N248J] A-shares, which have historically traded at a large premium to H-shares, have recently traded at over a 5 percent discount to H-shares, they say, and the move by Chinese regulators to allow freer cross-border trading "could be the catalyst that brings the share classes back in line - as evidenced by the spread tightening by 1.7 percent after the announcement." Thus, investors may profit from getting long exposure to A-shares. ETFs such as Deutsche Asset and Wealth Management's db X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares Fund <ASHR.P>, Van Eck Global's Market Vectors ChinaAMC A-Share ETF <PEK.P>, and KraneShares' Bosera MSCI China A Share ETF <KBA.P> all allow direct access to China's mainland A-shares market.
