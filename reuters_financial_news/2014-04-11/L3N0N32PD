MUMBAI, April 11 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Friday, retreating from record highs hit in the previous session as blue chips such as Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> declined ahead of quarterly earnings and inflation data due next week.

Sentiment was also hit by a slide in global shares as steep falls in U.S. technology and biotechnology stocks spread to other sectors and regions. [MKTS/GLOB] After a week in which both the BSE <.BSESN> and NSE indexes <.NSEI> hit record highs, investors are bracing for consumer inflation data due on Tuesday, the same day that Infosys <INFY.NS> is due to post quarterly earnings. [ID:nL3N0N02UW] The events will provide a snapshot on the Indian economy, which many analysts say continues to struggle. Data on Friday showed the trade deficit <INTRD=ECI> widening to $10.51 billion in March from $8.13 billion in February on lower exports. [ID:nL3N0N3258] "The firm trend in the Sensex continued. The broad theme remained the same with domestic cyclicals outperforming the IT and FMCG sectors," said Dipen Shah, head of private client group research at Kotak Securities. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> fell 0.38 percent, or 86.37 points, to end at 22,628.96. The index rose 1.2 percent for the week, marking its third consecutive weekly gain. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> lost 0.3 percent, or 20.10 points, to end at 6,776.30, but gained 1.22 percent for the week. Indian equity, forex and debt markets will be closed on Monday for a local holiday.  Among blue-chips, Reliance Industries fell 1.6 percent, while Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> ended 1.2 percent lower. Bank shares <.NSEBANK> fell 0.8 percent after a central bank panel recommended a slew of measures, including potentially changing how lending rates are set for the sector, raising worries about overall profitability.
