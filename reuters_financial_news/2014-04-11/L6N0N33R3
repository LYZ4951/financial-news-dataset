WARSAW, April 11 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Innova Capital has bid for Polish telecoms group ATM <ATMP.WA> in a 451 million zloty ($150.1 million) deal, already supported by a fund controlled by ATM's deputy chief executive holding 25 percent of the stock.

The bid is priced at 12.4 zlotys for each ATM share, banking group UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, which is coordinating the deal, said in a statement on Friday. ATM shareholders have been given between May 5 and June 4 to sell their holdings. Shares in the group jumped by over 9 percent to 12.0 zlotys for each share in Warsaw trade on Friday, their highest level this year. Innova last year sold its stake in central European fibre optic infrastructure provider GTS to Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> in a 546 million euro ($759 million) deal, soon after one of its units agreed to buy Poland's No.2 web portal from operator Orange Polska <OPL.WA> for 375 million zlotys.
