VIENNA, April 11 (Reuters) - The head of the Raiffeisen bank in the Austrian province of Upper Austria has threatened to move its headquarters across the border to Germany in a growing row with the government over a bank levy which lenders say is too onerous.

The remarks by Heinrich Schaller, head of Raiffeisen Landesbank Oberoesterreich <RLBOp.VI>, to a regional newspaper comes after the Czech president said this week that Erste Group <ERST.VI> may move its headquarters to Prague. [ID:nL6N0N1360] "It would be negligent in business management terms if I did not consider moving to be an option," Schaller told the Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten in an interview printed on Friday, noting its bank levy bill in Germany would fall to around 5 million euros ($6.9 million) from 34 million euros in Austria. "We are not the only bank that is considering a move abroad," he added.  Austrian banks have chafed under the government's campaign to recoup funds that taxpayers provided to help the sector through the financial crisis. A levy on big banks' assets raises around 640 million euros a year for the state budget. Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann said last week he would keep that levy despite a parallel programme to set up a fund to enable the winding-down of ailing euro zone banks. [ID:nL5N0MT3DX]
