April 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sycomore Eurocap's  'Excellent' Fund Quality Rating. The fund is managed by Sycomore Asset  Management (Sycomore AM, rated 'High Standards' by Fitch).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fund Presentation Launched in October 2001, Sycomore Eurocap is a long-only eurozone equity fund  investing in companies of all market capitalisations, with EUR433m of assets at  end-March 2014.   Investment Process The fund's investment process is based on a highly-disciplined, fundamental  stock-picking approach that has remained unchanged since the fund's inception.  Equity research is thorough, combining detailed qualitative analysis of  companies and standardised fundamental valuation methodologies. It is  efficiently supported by a proprietary research database, which centralises all  internal fundamental, quantitative and valuation information since 2001, and  imposes a common framework.  Active stock selection decisions drive the fund's market exposure and  allocation.   Resources Eurocap has been managed since its inception by Emeric Preaubert (23 years'  experience in equity analysis and management), who is also one of Sycomore AM's  founding partners. He is seconded by Arnaud d'Aligny (17 years' experience in  investment bank and structured finance), who joined in September 2011 and acts  as his back-up. The two portfolio managers have autonomy in their decision  making while drawing, to a large extent, on the whole team's research and  convictions.  Track Record The long term track-record is strong (first performance quintile, with 77.8%  since inception - I share, at end-March 2014), as illustrated by a Lipper Leader  score of five over 10 years. In 2013, the fund underperformed its benchmark by  1.2%, mostly due to sector selection, while outperforming its peers (Lipper  Global Equity Eurozone category) by 0.9%.  Fund Manager Founded in 2001, Sycomore AM is an independent asset management company, 90%  owned by its four founding partners and employees. At end-March 2014, Sycomore  AM had EUR2.3bn of assets under management, of which 80% were in eurozone  long-only equity portfolios.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the investment or operational  processes, or resources dedicated to the fund. A material adverse deviation from  Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could result in a downgrade,  notably a deterioration of the manager's superior stock-picking skills as  reflected in performance attribution. Also, the lead PM occupies a key role and  his departure could result in a rating review. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings combine Fitch's experience in qualitative fund  analysis with rankings and performance data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters  company. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings offer an independent, forward-looking  assessment of a fund's key performance and risk attributes and consistency of  longer-term returns, relative to peer group or benchmarks. The ratings focus on  the fund manager's investment process, key fund performance drivers, risk  management, and the quality of the fund's operational infrastructure.
