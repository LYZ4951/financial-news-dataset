NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Michael Foods Group Inc is in advanced talks to sell itself for close to $2.5 billion, with Tyson Foods Inc <TSN.N> and Post Holdings Inc <POST.N> emerging as final contenders to clinch a deal, people familiar with the matter said.

A transaction is expected to come in the next two weeks for the egg and dairy products producer, which has been put up for sale by Goldman Sachs Group Inc's <GS.N> private equity arm, the people said on Friday. Michael Foods is evaluating binding bids from Tyson and Post that were submitted earlier this week and has yet to determine which party to sell to, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public.
