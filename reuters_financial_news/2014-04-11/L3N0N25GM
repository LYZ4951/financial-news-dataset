April 11 (Reuters) - Shanghai Yupei Group said private equity firm RRJ Capital and SeaTown, a unit of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], have agreed to invest $250 million in the Chinese logistics company.

The capital raising plus the $200 million it raised last year from U.S. private equity firms The Carlyle Group <CG.O> and The Townsend Group, completes Yupei's equity financing needs for the foreseeable future, the company said in a statement late on Thursday.
