MILAN, April 11 (Reuters) - Italy paid the lowest yield on record to sell three- and seven-year bonds at auction on Friday, a welcome relief to the country's public finances at a time when the government is betting on tax cuts to spur growth.

The treasury raised 7.225 billion euros ($10 billion) in bonds, near the top of its planned issue range. Speculation that the European Central Bank could start an asset-purchase programme and signs of economic recovery in Italy fed demand from investors, analysts said. Italy paid a record-low yield of 0.93 percent on a three-year bond due in December 2016, down from 1.12 percent a month ago. The sale was covered 1.4 times against 1.5 times in March. It also sold a seven-year bond at 2.44 percent, down from 2.71 percent at the previous auction and the lowest level on this recently-introduced maturity. Demand for the 2021 bond was around 1.5 times the amount sold, down from 1.6 last month.
