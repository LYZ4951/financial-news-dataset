HONG KONG, April 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's China enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading mainland companies fell 2.4 percent on Friday morning as investors unloaded Chinese stocks after the announcement of a cross-border stock investment plan with Shanghai on Thursday. [ID:nL3N0N21SK]

Investors sold Hong Kong-listed H-shares in a bid to narrow the gap between the stock price in the city and in Shanghai, triggering the biggest loss for the H-shares index since February 4. That compared to a 0.7 percent slide in the benchmark Hang Seng Index <.HSI>. Ping An <2318.HK><601318.SS> led the slide in the index falling nearly 6 percent to their lowest in over two weeks, and China Life <2628.HK><601628.SS> was down more than 5 percent.
