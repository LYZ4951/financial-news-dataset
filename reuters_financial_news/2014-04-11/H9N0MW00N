SHANGHAI, April 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished down 0.8 percent on Friday, with a sell-off in dual-listed shares dragging down Chinese shares listed in the territory.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down at 23,003.64 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was off 1.85 percent, its worst one-day percentage drop in 9 weeks.  The slump in H-shares came after investors dumped dual- listed China shares that had been trading at a premium to their mainland counterparts following an announcement on Thursday that mainland and Hong Kong investors would soon be able to invest in each other's markets.  Anhui Conch <600585.SS> <0914.HK> led the slide on the index falling 7.2 percent, with Ping An <2318.HK> <601318.SS> falling 5 percent to its lowest in over two weeks, and China Life <2628.HK> <601628.SS> down 5.3 percent. But Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd <0388.HK> rode high on the news, gaining 11.5 percent to reach its best level in over a year.
