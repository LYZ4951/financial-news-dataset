PARIS, April 11 (Reuters) - Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, France's second-largest bank, said on Friday it had increased its exposure to Russia by raising its stake in Rosbank <ROSB.MM> to 99.4 percent.

Societe Generale said it bought 7 percent of Rosbank's share capital from Interros group, controlled by Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin. The bank said the transaction had a limited impact of a few basis points on the group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, which stood at 10 percent at the end of 2013.
