April 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has today affirmed Northern Rock's (Asset  Management) <NRKx.L> (NRAM) and Bradford & Bingley's <BB_p.L> (B&B) senior unsecured debt at  'AA+'. A full list of rated issues is provided at the end of this rating action  commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT NRAM's and B&B's senior unsecured debt ratings reflect Fitch's view that the  default risk on these securities is materially the same as the UK sovereign risk  (AA+/Stable). This is because as nationalised institutions, NRAM and B&B have  some of their unsecured senior and unsubordinated debt as well as any  accumulated interest on them guaranteed by the UK government by way of a public  law guarantee.  The guarantee extends until the maturity of both issuers' guaranteed debt and is  renewed on an annual basis. Fitch believes that even though there is no specific  reference to the guarantee being unconditional and irrevocable, it would be  extremely unlikely that the UK would assume any reputational or economic risks  by failing to provide support if needed.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT  NRAM's and B&B's senior unsecured debt ratings are sensitive to a change in  Fitch's assumptions around the UK sovereign rating or to any material changes to  the conditions of the guarantee granted by the UK government to NRAM and B&B.  Fitch believes that timely payment under the guarantee is highly likely even  under a new government, as non-payment of the guarantor would seriously tarnish  the UK's reputation in this important area of public policy.
