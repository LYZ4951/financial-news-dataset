BEIRUT, April 11 (Reuters) - Workers at Lebanese banks held a one-day strike on Friday in protest at a proposal by lawmakers to tax interest earned on deposits more heavily to help fund public wages rises.

Lebanon's parliament is discussing an increase in public sector wages in response to more than two years of union strikes and protests. But deputies say they need to collect additional revenues to fund the increases so as not to widen the state deficit. One proposal from a parliamentary committee is to raise the tax on interest on deposits to 7 percent from 5 percent. The Association of Banks in Lebanon said this would have a "negative impact on the stability of the Lebanese pound and citizens' purchasing power". Lebanon is one of the most indebted countries in the world and banks hold most of the public debt.
