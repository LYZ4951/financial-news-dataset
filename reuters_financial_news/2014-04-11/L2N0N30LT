We agreed that the IMF has to play a leading role in helping Ukraine." "In the G7 we agreed that we have to find a common solution." "We must not make it too difficult for Russia ... we have to find a way to solve this problem in partnership." "But you cannot rule out an escalation." "We will have to react on this (impasse over Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine) quickly."
