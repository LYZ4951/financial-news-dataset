April 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published its criteria detailing how ratings of structured finance (SF) notes and covered bonds (CVB) are constrained by the credit quality of the sovereign to which the SF transaction or CVB programme is exposed. The methodology is consistent with the  one presented in the exposure draft published on 22 January 2014. The criteria provide details of Fitch's current approach to assigning SF and CVB  ratings that are higher than the relevant sovereign local currency Issuer  Default Rating (LC IDR), and outline how Fitch embeds sovereign default risk in  its rating stresses. It also details methodology applicable to ratings of  multi-jurisdictional SF notes or CVB. These criteria are applicable globally to  international scale ratings, with the exception of those jurisdictions falling  within the scope of the "Criteria for Rating Securitisations in Emerging  Markets". Fitch believes that it is not possible to completely de-link SF and CVB ratings  from the credit quality of the relevant sovereign, as a high level of sovereign  default risk raises the prospect of extreme events occurring in a country and  reduces the certainty of performance projections for SF and CVB assets. CVB are  also further affected by sovereign risk through its impact upon the issuing bank  and liquidity of the cover pool. These criteria are not expected to affect ratings assigned to SF notes or CVB  whose securitised or cover pool assets are concentrated in a single  jurisdiction, as it reflects Fitch current global analytical practices with  respect to rating caps. Similarly, no major revision of the base case and stress  assumptions currently applied by Fitch are expected. These are expected to  incorporate sufficient cushion to withstand the risks discussed in these  criteria, including the proposed sovereign distress scenario.  In contrast, however, a limited number of ratings assigned to  multi-jurisdictional SF notes and CVB may be downgraded by one or two notches  upon implementation of the criteria. Fitch will publish the consequent rating  actions in the following weeks, if any. As detailed in the criteria, the ratings of SF notes and CVB issued in foreign  currency cannot exceed the Country Ceiling (CC) of the country of the assets,  unless the transfer and convertibility (T&C) risk is mitigated. Where T&C risk  is mitigated, ratings cannot be higher than four notches above the CC. In  addition, Fitch SF and CVB ratings are capped at a maximum of six notches above  the sovereign LC IDR. This cap is independent of the CC-related cap and  represents an additional rating constraint reflecting the increased likelihood  of extreme macroeconomic events and significant adverse events occurring (e.g.  political interference in the economy), which Fitch associates with a high level  of sovereign default risk.  In all cases where SF notes or CVB are rated above the sovereign LC IDR, Fitch  expects the credit protection available to the notes or bonds to be sufficiently  robust to withstand the stresses resulting from a sovereign default, such that  they are not expected to default in such a scenario.  SF and CVB ratings in countries that are part of currency unions (most notably,  the eurozone) would not exceed the country's CC, which captures the risk of the  imposition of capital controls and/or an exit from the union. This is because  Fitch expects that upon an exit from the union T&C risk may not be mitigated  and/or event risks could be acute.  Fitch's long standing view remains that the  departure of any country from the eurozone is unlikely and is significantly  lower than a sovereign default within it. Due to their diversified country risk exposure, T&C risk can become a secondary  rating driver for multi-jurisdictional structures. For this reason, Fitch  applies a specific and less stringent approach where the exposure to sovereigns  with a lower CC than the SF or CVB rating is below 20%. As in the case of  single-jurisdiction SF transactions or CVB, exposure to macroeconomic and/or  event risks is analysed separately and may lead to rating caps if material,  regardless of the T&C risk assessment.
