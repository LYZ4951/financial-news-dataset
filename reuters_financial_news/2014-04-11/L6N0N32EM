LISBON, April 11 (Reuters) - Investment recommendations by certified analysts on Portuguese shares were overly optimistic last year, even as the market rose, the country's securities market regulator CMVM said, warning that investors should take them with a grain of salt.

CMVM's annual report that analysed 655 financial research notes from local and foreign analysts in the year to October 2013, showed on Friday that only two in every five recommendations came true, reaching or exceeding the target price for a share. More than 43 percent of all recommendations were to buy shares, with over half of price targets predicting a valuation of over 9 percent, and just over 21 percent were tagged "sell". "This optimism tuned out largely excessive," the CMVM said, adding that there were often large differences in evaluation by analysts pointing to "financial analysis that is not free from subjectivity". "Therefore ... the results (of such analysis) should not be taken at face value by investors," the report added. Lisbon's bluechip PSI20 <.PSI20> stock index gained 16 percent in the year ending in October 2013 as the country's economy started to recover from its worst recession since the 1970s.
