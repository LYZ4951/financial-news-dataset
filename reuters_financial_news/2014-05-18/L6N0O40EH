LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - British property website Zoopla will announce plans this week for a stock market listing that will value the company at about one billion pounds ($1.7 billion), the Sunday Times newspaper reported.

The flotation would be a boost for newspaper publisher Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) <DMGOa.L> which controls 51 percent of the seven-year-old company, the report added. Plans were likely to be confirmed on Thursday when DMGT releases it latest financial results. DMGT will sell a "substantial number" of shares in the offering although it wants to remain the largest investor, the report added. Zoopla refused to comment directly on the report but a spokesman referred to a statement made earlier this year. "As one of the fastest growing online businesses in the UK, our focus remains on developing our business in a sustainable way. Meanwhile, we are continuing to work with our advisers to consider our strategic options," it said.
