SYDNEY, May 19 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to edge up on Monday, underpinned by modest gains on Wall Street and an uptick in nickel and copper prices.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> added 0.1 percent, a 19-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark fell 0.6 percent on Friday, but added 0.3 percent for the week.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 0.2 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended higher in a late-day rebound as small-cap names and consumer discretionary shares advanced.  * Nickel prices rose on Friday, as investors refocused on shrinking supplies, while copper was on track to post its biggest weekly gain in nearly two months on robust demand.  * Gold fell as encouraging U.S. housing data weighed on its appeal as a hedge against economic weakness, while platinum notched its biggest weekly gain in a month-and-a-half as strikes in South Africa continued.  * Rio Tinto <RIO.L> <RIO.AX> is not actively seeking to divest assets this year but would consider any attractive offers, Chief Executive Sam Walsh said on Friday. * Rio was also optimistic of finalizing an investment agreement with Guinea for the Simandou iron ore deposit by the end of the month, Walsh told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. [ID:nL1N0O40HR] * DuluxGroup Ltd <DLX.AX> said its first-half net profit was A$60 million, compared to A$32 million last year.
