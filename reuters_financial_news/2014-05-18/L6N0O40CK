CAIRO, May 18 (Reuters) - Egypt's Medinet Nasr for Housing and Development <MNHD.CA> reported a net profit for the first quarter of 2014 of 55.3 million Egyptian pounds ($7.8 million) on Sunday, around 3 percent lower than in the same period last year.

Sales increased to 169.12 million pounds from 166.70 million pounds in the first quarter of 2013, the company said in a statement sent to the stock exchange. Medinet Nasr plans to complete the off-plan sale of homes in its 300,000 square-meter Taj Sultan project by early 2015, then launch another development of similar size, its general manager told Reuters earlier this month.
