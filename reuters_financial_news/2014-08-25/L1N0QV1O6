NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Communications equipment maker Comtech Telecommunications Corp <CMTL.O> is exploring a potential sale and has received preliminary expressions of interest in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Comtech, which makes satellite-based communications equipment for commercial and government customers, has tapped investment bank Citigroup <C.N> to assist with that effort, the people said on Monday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Shares of Comtech jumped more than 12 percent in afternoon trading on news of a potential sale and closed 4.8 percent higher at $36.81, giving it a market capitalization of roughly $590 million. Comtech had considered selling itself a few times in the past, and there is no guarantee the latest process will lead to a transaction, the people cautioned. Representatives for Comtech did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Citigroup declined to comment. Comtech has long been seen as a takeover candidate for larger aerospace and defense companies, and over the past several years has held multiple discussions with potential buyers such as Airbus parent EADS, people familiar with the matter have said.
