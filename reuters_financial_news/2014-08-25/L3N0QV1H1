HONG KONG, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Chinese police are questioning the former audit director of China Resources Holdings Co Ltd [CHRESR.UL] as part of a broad investigation into suspected corruption in the state-owned company, a government newspaper reported on Monday.

The Economic Information Daily said Huang Daoguo, who retired this month, was believed to have illegally obtained an audit report on China Resources Holding, which he passed on to the company's now sacked chairman, Song Lin. China Resources Holdings is a holding company for a group of energy, land and consumer businesses in mainland China and Hong Kong. Huang was also an non-executive director at several of the group's units, including China Resources Gas <1193.HK>, China Resources Cement <1313.HK> and China Resources Power <0836.HK>, the paper said. China's top anti-corruption body has been investigating China Resources Holdings and its units for several months as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on graft by President Xi Jinping, who has pledged to tackle high-ranking "tigers" as well as lowly "flies".   In April, the anti corruption body said former chairman Song was being investigated on suspicion of a serious violation of discipline. Violating discipline is official jargon for corrupt activities. Song was later sacked as chairman. [ID:nL3N0N931J] [ID:nL3N0NB023]
