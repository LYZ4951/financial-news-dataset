KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 25 (Reuters) - CIMB Islamic, the sharia compliant unit of Malaysia's second largest bank, is preparing an Islamic bond programme to raise up to 5 billion Malaysian ringgit ($1.58 billion), according to ratings agency MARC.

The Basel III compliant sukuk programme, assigned a preliminary rating of AA+ by MARC, will go towards replacing an existing 2 billion ringgit Tier-2 sukuk and to fund working capital, the agency said on Monday.  The securities commission is still finalising approval and CIMB <CIMB.KL> is not expected to issue sukuk from the programme any time soon, an official with MARC said. The company did not specify the range of maturities or sizes for sukuk under the programme. CIMB is currently in talks with two smaller banks to create a mega-Islamic bank. The deal would make CIMB the country's biggest bank by assets, ahead of Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) <MBBM.KL>.
