NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 briefly hurdled above 2,000 for the first time on Monday, with financials and biotechnology stocks lifting the benchmark index to a record as investors make equities their asset of choice.

The significance of the milestone was more psychological than fundamental, and it represents the high point of a six-year rally that has boosted retirement accounts for Americans from Wall Street to Main Street, though the gains have largely benefited wealthier Americans. On a total-return basis the S&P 500 has more than tripled from its 2009 low hit during the financial crisis.  The day's gains were broad, with each of the 10 primary sectors on the benchmark S&P index advancing. Advancers were comfortably outpacing decliners on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.  "Though (S&P 2,000) is a major mile marker and enormous optical, it is very much in keeping with the general tone of how the market has behaved over the past few weeks," said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. "In other words, it's not as if we are reaching for it, it feels as though it fits with the narrative of the market's very broad move higher."   The index has managed to climb despite cautious signals for the economy, including tepid U.S. growth, a reduction in stimulus from the Federal Reserve and a simmering conflict between Ukraine and Russia. In the latest economic data, reads on both the U.S. services sector and the housing market came in below forecasts.
