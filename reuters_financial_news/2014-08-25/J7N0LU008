JERUSALEM, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel lowered its benchmark interest rate <ILINR=ECI> to an all-time low of 0.25 percent from a previous 0.5 percent on Monday, its second straight monthly reduction aimed at boosting economic growth.

All 10 economists polled by Reuters had forecast no move, which came amid a seven-year low in the inflation rate and data showing Israel's economy was weakening. Growth is forecast at 2.9 percent in 2014 but the central bank has said the Israel-Hamas war could shave a half point off of that figure. In the second quarter, the economy grew an annualised 1.7 percent, well below expectations.
