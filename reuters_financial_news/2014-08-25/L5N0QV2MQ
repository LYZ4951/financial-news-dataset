Following are highlights of ECB policymakers' comments since the bank's July 3 meeting. To read full stories, click on the links in brackets.  MARIO DRAGHI (PRESIDENT), AUG 22 "Over the month of August financial markets have indicated that inflation expectations exhibited significant declines at all horizons." "... The Governing Council will acknowledge these developments and within its mandate will use all the available instruments needed to ensure price stability over the medium term." [ID:nL5N0QU1BQ]  JENS WEIDMANN (GERMANY), AUG 12 "Overall, we expect the relatively positive development of the German economy to continue." "We are sticking, more or less, with our forecasts that we have already made public." [ID:nF9N0OS006]  DRAGHI, AUG 7 "There is no doubt if you look at the world today that the geopolitical risks have increased." [ID:nL6N0QD4B1]  JOSEF BONNICI (MALTA), JULY 30  "The fact is that we are waiting to see the impact of measures already taken. At this stage one has to leave some options open."  ARDO HANSSON (ESTONIA), JULY 17 "It's worth preparing, it's worth having more tools, but I don't think quantitative easing is a tool that's needed right now."  EWALD NOWOTNY (AUSTRIA), JULY 16 On a possible ECB programme to buy asset-backed securities: "I'm not sure this thing would fly." [ID:nL6N0PR324]  DRAGHI (PRESIDENT), JULY 14 "In the present context, an appreciated exchange rate is a risk to the sustainability of the recovery." [ID:nL6N0PP5C7]  BENOIT COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD), JULY 13 "Of course the measures that we take are not a panacea. We eliminate some obstacles but monetary policy cannot improve productivity and long-term growth." [ID:nL6N0PN10P]  WEIDMANN (GERMANY), JULY 12 "It is clear that monetary policy, when seen from a German viewpoint, is too expansive for Germany, too loose." [ID:nL6N0PN0EI]  DRAGHI (PRESIDENT), JULY 9 "There is a strong case for us to apply the same principles to the governance of structural reforms as we do to fiscal governance. The essential cohesion of the union depends on it." [ID:nL6N0PK5CH]  PETER PRAET (EXECUTIVE BOARD), JULY 9 "We have a sequence of liquidity injections in the pipeline ... When you have built in a sequence of liquidity injections it is premature to talk about new measures. We want to see how they go through." [ID:nF9N0O002A]  COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD), JULY 9 "We've taken decisive action in June, if this is not enough we will do more but we have no reason to believe this will not be enough." [ID:nF9N0O0027]  LUC COENE (BELGIUM), JULY 9 "It is wrong to say the euro is very strong. Just before the financial crisis, we have to remember, the euro pointed towards $1.60." [ID:nL6N0PK126]  SABINE LAUTENSCHLAEGER (EXECUTIVE BOARD), JULY 7 On prospects for large-scale asset purchases by the ECB: "Only in a real emergency, for example in the case of the immediate prospect of deflation, could, in my view, such an instrument come into consideration. Such risks are, however, neither perceptible nor do we expect them." [ID:nL6N0PI4Q9]  COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD), JULY 7 "Growth being very weak, it is clear that very accommodative monetary conditions are going to be necessary for quite a long time." [ID:nS8N0OC004]  CHRISTIAN NOYER (FRANCE), JULY 5 "Even if the risk of deflation seems to have been avoided, we have ... price increases that are too low." [ID:nL6N0PG0LH]  WEIDMANN (GERMANY), JULY 3
