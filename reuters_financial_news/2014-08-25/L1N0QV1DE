NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - An amendment to U.S. bankruptcy law that would allow municipal entities in Puerto Rico to restructure their debt could be passed by the U.S. Congress as early as the start of next year, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress said on Monday.

Congressman Pedro Pierluisi introduced the legislation in the House of Representatives in July. The Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act would amend Chapter 9 of the U.S. bankruptcy code that at present excludes public entities in Puerto Rico from declaring bankruptcy. The U.S. territory's troubled electric authority, known as PREPA, is currently negotiating with bondholders and may restructure over $9 billion in debt. Pierluisi believes amending Chapter 9 would be preferable to Puerto Rico's own recently passed and controversial bankruptcy legislation. He said a January or February time frame for passage of the legislation was possible. "If it's handled in the House with no controversy then you would expect that the Senate would go along rather quickly," Pierluisi said in an interview. "If there is controversy there would be a different story, but I don't see any developing."  Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth but it citizens cannot vote in national elections. Its representative in Congress can introduce legislation but cannot vote. Pierluisi is holding meetings in New York this week with hedge fund managers who have been buying Puerto Rico's debt. He  did not name the investors but said there was a "long list" of hedge funds he had been meeting.  He is also meeting officials from the New York Federal Reserve and ratings agency Standard & Poor's, following earlier meetings with Fitch and Moody's. Pierluisi is running for Puerto Rico governor in 2016 and is attending a fundraiser related to that on Monday evening. Getting Congress to pass the legislation by early next year could be difficult in the current partisan climate, especially given midterm elections in November. But Pierluisi believes he may be able to get the measure passed in conjunction with other legislation such as a budget appropriation bill, if Congress does not act on his bill. PREPA is currently in a forbearance agreement with creditors until the end of March. Getting the legislation passed before that would provide PREPA with a widely accepted legal framework to restructure its debt should negotiations break down.
