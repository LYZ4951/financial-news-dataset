TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte [GIC.UL] is in final talks to buy a Tokyo office tower for about 170 billion yen ($1.6 billion), three people with direct knowledge of the deal said, in what would be Japan's biggest property transaction since the global financial crisis.

GIC, which already has a large presence in Japan's property market, outbid the asset management unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N>, which also participated in the final bid for the property which was put up for sale by Secured Capital, part of Asian private equity firm PAG.
