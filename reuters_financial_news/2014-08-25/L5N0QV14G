BUDAPEST, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Central European assets firmed across the board on Monday, helped by expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) may launch large-scale asset purchases.

That speculation was triggered by comments made by ECB President Mario Draghi late on Friday. Poland's 10-year benchmark bond yield <PL10YT=RR> fell 8 basis points to 3.08 percent. The reaction was more muted in Hungary, where yields dropped 1-3 basis points, with 10-year paper <HU10YT=RR> trading at 4.46 percent. "It is mainly the Draghi comments ... bonds in the euro zone peripheries also firmed, with Spanish and Portuguese yields dropping 6-10 basis points, and that helped bonds here, or could further help them," one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. The forint <EURHUF=> firmed 0.1 percent. Poland's zloty <EURPLN=> and the Czech crown <EURCZK=> gained 0.2 percent. The leu <EURRON=> was flat, giving up opening gains. UniCredit Tiriac analyst Mihai Patrulescu said the currency was helped by a large amount of short positions in the market and end-of-month tax payments by Romanian companies. Slovenia's 10-year bond yield <SI10YT=RR> fell 5 basis points to 2.88 percent, the lowest since the country joined the euro zone in 2007, ahead of a parliamentary vote later on Monday which is expected to confirm law professor and political novice Miro Cerar as prime minister.   Equities mostly firmed in the region, led by a one percent rise in Prague's main stock index <.PX> as the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, which weighed on regional asset prices earlier this month, did not escalate further at the week-end. Budapest's main stock index <.BUX> firmed by two-thirds of a percent, helped by a rise of the shares of OTP <OTPB.BU> - a bank which has business both in Russia and Ukraine - which plunged three percent just before Friday's close. The stock traded at 4,075 forints, up 1.2 percent.  "I have no explanation for either the fall or the rebound... OTP shares have become highly speculative recently," one Budapest-based equities trader said.  "It can move anywhere between 3,800 and 4,200 forints, and after we see how the government package (which will boost the costs of Hungarian banks this year) unfolds, it may rise above those levels," the trader said.  A Hungarian court on Friday rejected a lawsuit brought by a small savings bank to challenge a new law mandating refunds to loan clients. A court will discuss a similar lawsuit, brought by KBC <KBC.BR> unit K&H, on Monday. The refunds could cause a cost of about 900 billion forints ($3.8 billion) to the Hungarian banking sector and the conversion of foreign currency loans into forints, planned by the government for late this year, could cause further costs.  DINAR FIRMS Serbia's dinar <EURRSD=> firmed 0.1 percent to 117.56 against the euro, but stayed near its weakest levels for two years touched last week. Serbia struggles with a huge budget deficit around 8 percent of economic output. Its unemployment rate is 20 percent and its economy is expected to contract this year due to devastating floods in May. Russia said on Saturday that it lifted a ban on dairy imports from two firms in Serbia, in an apparent attempt to woo the European Union membership candidate amid Moscow's standoff with the West. [ID:nL5N0QT0N3] Serbia said on Friday it would not subsidise exports to Russia, after the European Union urged it not to exploit the Kremlin's ban on Western food imports.
