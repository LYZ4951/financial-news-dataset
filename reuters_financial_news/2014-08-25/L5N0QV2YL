JOHANNESBURG, Aug 25 (Reuters) - South Africa's Bidvest <BVTJ.J> said on Monday it had yet to decide on whether to make an offer to raise its stake in drugmaker Adcock Ingram <AIPJ.J>.

Bidvest is a conglomerate that spans shipping to catering and with a group called Community Investment Holdings (CIH) owns 34.5 percent of Adcock, South Africa's second-largest drugmaker. A document from South Africa's competition regulator seen by Reuters on Thursday said Bidvest intended to increase that to more than 50 percent. [ID:nL5N0QR4SB] Increasing the stake to 35 percent would force Bidvest and CIH to make a buy-out offer to Adcock's minority shareholders. Bidvest and CIH said in a statement the Competition Tribunal "had approved the future acquisition of control of Adcock Ingram" by the pair but no offer was on the table.
