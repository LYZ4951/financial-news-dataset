SYDNEY, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Australian shares are likely to rise modestly after the S&P 500 closed at record highs, but resources stocks may underperform as benchmark spot iron ore prices remained locked near the year's lows.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> climbed 0.1 percent to 5,604.0, but was a 30.9-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close.  * The benchmark lost 0.2 percent on Monday, snapping seven consecutive sessions of gains, its longest streak since mid-July.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was flat at 5,182.8 in early trade. * The S&P 500 was unable to hold the 2,000 mark after moving above the milestone level for the first time on Monday, but still managed to close at a record high, buoyed by financials and biotechnology stocks. * Benchmark spot iron ore is now trading close to this year's low of $89 a tonne and a further decline would take it to its weakest since September 2012, as top, low-cost miners lift output even more in a bid to take out smaller producers. * Senex Energy Ltd <SXY.AX> reported full year gross profit of A$89.1 million, up 27 percent.
