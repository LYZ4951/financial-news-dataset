CAIRO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Monday, with the bank saying it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from last Thursday's rate.

The rate for dollar sales has stayed in a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. The central bank offered $40 million on Monday.
