NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Communications equipment maker Comtech Telecommunications Corp <CMTL.O> is exploring a potential sale and has received preliminary expressions of interest in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Comtech, which has a market capitalization of roughly $560 million, is working with investment bank Citigroup <C.N> to assist with that effort, the people said on Monday, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Comtech had considered selling itself a few times in the past and there is no guarantee the latest process will lead to a transaction, the people cautioned.
