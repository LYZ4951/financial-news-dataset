SYDNEY, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Australia's financial system is susceptible to shocks in the economy, a government-backed review on Sunday said, recommending measures including raising capital levels for banks to make them stronger and more resilient.

The report did not specify how much extra capital should be held by the banks to guard against a failure in the event of a repeat of the global financial crisis. Bank executives have been bracing for the Financial System Inquiry report for months, arguing that higher levels of capital are unnecessary and would come at a cost to the economy.
