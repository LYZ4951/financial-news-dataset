STOCKHOLM, March 13 (Reuters) - The Swedish unit of Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor <TEL.OL> has introduced a low price brand, the company said on Thursday, which means that all four major Swedish mobile operators now have a downmarket unit.

"We launched a beta version on Feb 12 which runs until the end of March. After that we will make a more traditional launch," Johan Littorin, head of Telenor Sweden's low price brand Vimla, told Reuters on Thursday.  Telenor's launch follows that of competitor 3 Scandinavia, owned by Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa <0013.HK> and Swedish investment company Investor <INVEb.ST>, which last year launched Swedish low cost brand "Hallon". Top mobile operator TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST> has had its "Halebop" low-end brand for years, while low-cost Comviq is owned by number two mobile operator Tele2 <TEL2b.ST>. Vimla offers a flat rate of 200 Swedish crowns per month for 1 GB of data, which gives 32 minutes of internet surfing per day, and unlimited text and calls. This compares to Comviq's price of 195 crowns per month. "Vimla is not only a low price brand," Littorin said. "We invite our members, we don't call them customers, to influence the service by tipping off (Vimla) to others, thereby lowering their prices. They can also get a reward if they have a good suggestion to us," he added. The name Vimla means social interaction with other people.
