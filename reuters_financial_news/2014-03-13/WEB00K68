VIENNA, March 13 (Reuters) - Austrian lender BAWAG PSK [CCMLPB.UL] is not for sale and its shareholders remain committed to the lender, Chief Executive Byron Haynes said on Thursday, dismissing speculation that majority owner Cerberus [CBS.UL] was actively seeking an exit.

"There is no sale process out there," he told reporters.
