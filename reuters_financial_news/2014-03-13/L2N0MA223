NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based funds poured $9.2 billion into stock funds in the week ended March 12, marking their fifth straight week of inflows, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

Stock mutual funds attracted $4.5 billion in new cash, while stock exchange-traded funds attracted $4.7 billion. Mutual funds are commonly purchased by retail investors, while ETFs are thought to represent the institutional investor.  Funds that specialize in Japanese stocks attracted inflows of $785 million in new cash, marking their biggest weekly inflows since May of last year.  Taxable bond funds, meanwhile, attracted $2.2 billion in inflows, reversing the prior week's outflows of $4.9 billion. Funds that specialize in inflation-protected bonds attracted about $218 million in new cash, marking their second straight week of inflows.
