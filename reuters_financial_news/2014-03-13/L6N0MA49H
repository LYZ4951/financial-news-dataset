ROME, March 13 (Reuters) - Foreign investors bought almost two-thirds of Italy's 10-year bond linked to euro zone inflation issued this week, while the rest was taken by domestic buyers, a statement from the Treasury said on Thursday.

About 200 investors took part in the placement. Of these, 64.7 percent were foreign, while 35.3 percent were domestic, the Treasury said. The bond matures on Sept. 15, 2024. Demand came to 11.4 billion euros, about two-and-a-half times the 4.5 billion euros issued.
