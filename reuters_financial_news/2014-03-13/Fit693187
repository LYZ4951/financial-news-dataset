March 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

German wholesale banks' move into the internet savings market to diversify their funding structure could be positive for their credit profiles and help them meet Basel III liquidity requirements, Fitch Ratings says - although a shift towards retail deposits would increase  funding costs in the short term. Diversification of funding is credit positive for wholesale banks, especially if  the duration of deposits is extended. For example, Deutsche Pfandbriefbank's <NUEG.UL> pbb  direkt extended its term deposit accounts to five and 10 years, even though most  of the savings volume is for one and three years. Retail deposits can help  wholesale banks meet Basel's Net Stable Funding and Liquidity Coverage ratios  because deposits of less than a year have a higher weighting than short-term  wholesale funding for the treatment of stable funding. But deposits originated through the internet tend to be price sensitive.  Competition is likely to remain intense, so a shift from cheaper unsecured  institutional funding to retail deposits will put pressure on net interest  margins. In addition, it is uncertain how these funds, which do not offer a  broad customer relationship, will react in times of stress. Internet deposits appear to be growing faster than traditional, branch-based  ones in Germany. Deposits from individuals grew 28% to EUR1.8bn at end-2013 from  EUR1.4bn at end-2007. But some sub-segments have been more aggressive with  internet deposits. Deposits for regional banks, which include direct banks, grew  54% to EUR308bn. Specialised real estate lenders' deposits increased 2.9x to  EUR4.9bn. Internet deposits collected by non-retail banks are not yet material,  but could prove important for individual banks in these two segments. Specialised real estate lenders fund themselves in wholesale markets, including  Pfandbriefe, but are now gathering internet deposits. Last week, Deutsche  Pfandbriefbank announced that deposits at pbb direkt, launched in March 2013,  exceeded EUR1bn. IKB has attracted deposits from around 50,000 private customers  via its online offer and Corealcredit Bank entered the market in 2012.
