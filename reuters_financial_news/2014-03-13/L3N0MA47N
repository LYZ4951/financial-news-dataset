JAKARTA, March 13 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank held its benchmark reference rate <BIPG> at 7.50 percent on Thursday, as expected.

The following is a text of Bank Indonesia's monetary policy statement, as translated by Reuters:  "The meeting of Bank Indonesia's board of governors on March 13, 2014 decided to maintain BI rate at 7.50 percent with rates of lending facility and deposit facility each at 7.50 percent and 5.75 percent. "The policy remained consistent with efforts to direct inflation towards its target of 4.5 percent plus or minus 1 percentage point in 2014 and 4 percent plus or minus 1 percentage point in 2015, as well as managing the current-account deficit lower towards a healthier level. Going forward, Bank Indonesia remains vigilant to various risks, both global and domestic, and will take anticipating measures to ensure a well maintained economic stability and promoting the economy towards a more balance direction to support recovery in current-account. "Therefore, Bank Indonesia will keep strengthening the monetary and macroprudential policy mix, continuing efforts to deepen financial markets, as well as improving coordination with the government to manage inflation and the current-account deficit, including policies to improve the economic structure. "The result of Bank Indonesia's evaluation showed global economic recovery continues, but with acceleration not as strong as expected. Bank Indonesia will remain vigilant on various risks from global economy, particularly related to the normalisation of the Fed's monetary policy, the possibility of global economic recovery not being as strong as expected due to a slowdown in China, and external vulnerability that could emerge in some emerging markets. "Bank Indonesia sees that moderation in Indonesia's economic growth will continue with a more balanced proportion. Growth of domestic consumption is expected to be lower than the previous estimate, due to the limited influence of elections compared with the previous elections, as well as transmission of stabilisation policy taken by Bank Indonesia and the government. Meanwhile, investment growth, including non-construction, is expected to rise in the second half of 2014. Real export will also be on in increasing trend, even though not as strong as previous estimates, due to weak global economic growth and the temporary impact from the implementation of mining law. With this assessment, Bank Indonesia estimates 2014 economic growth at around 5.5-5.9 percent. "A balanced economic growth will support the sustainability of improvement in Indonesia's external sectors, both from trade  and financial balance. Going forward, Bank Indonesia estimates the trade balance will post a surplus, on improvement in exports due to increasing demand from trading partner countries, as well as manageable imports in line with moderation in domestic demand. Bank Indonesia believes that the 2014 current-account deficit can be pushed down to below 3 percent of gross domestic product. "Healthier economic fundamentals which eventually encourage the improvement of the performance of the external sectors will have an impact on the strengthening of the rupiah. Bank Indonesia will consistently maintain the stability of the rupiah in line with its fundamentals and supported by efforts to deepen the foreign-exchange market. "Inflation in February 2014 was on a descending trend, hence it supports the prospect of inflation target in 2014 that is 4.5 percent plus or minus 1 percentage point. Bank Indonesia will remain vigilant on some inflation risks ahead, including potential inflationary pressures from the adjustment of administered prices, and will keep strengthening the policy mix and coordinating with the government to ensure inflation remains manageable in line with the target.
