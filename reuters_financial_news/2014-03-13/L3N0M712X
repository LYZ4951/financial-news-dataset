HONG KONG, March 13 (Reuters) - Ping An, China's second largest insurer by market value, posted a 40.4 percent rise in annual earnings, as investment income surged on the back of a recovery in China's stock market.

Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd <601318.SS> <2318.HK> made a net profit of 28.15 billion yuan ($4.58 billion) in the year ended Dec. 31. That was less than the 29.4 billion yuan analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters data.
