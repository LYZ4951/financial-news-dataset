March 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on OJSC MTS Bank's <MBRDI.RTS> (MTSB) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Positive from Stable and affirmed the IDR at 'B+'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this comment. The revision of the Outlook reflects the revision of the Outlook on Sistema  Joint Stock Financial Corp <AFKS.MM> (Sistema; BB-/Positive), MTSB's controlling  shareholder (see 'Fitch Revises Sistema's Outlook to Positive, Affirms at 'BB-'  dated 26 February 2014 at www.fitchratings.com).  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, NATIONAL LONG-TERM RATING, SUPPORT RATING MTSB's IDRs, National Long-term and Support Ratings factor in the likelihood of  support the bank may receive, if needed, from its major owner, Sistema, and/or  its subsidiaries. In Fitch's view, Sistema's propensity to provide support is likely to be high,  given the track record of capital support, including RUB5.1bn contributed in  April 2013 by OJSC Mobile TeleSystems <MTSS.MM> (MTS, BB+/Positive), a major operating  subsidiary of Sistema; the brand association with MTS; and the significant risks  of reputational and market access damage for the group in case of MTSB's  default. Fitch considers that the cost of any potential support would be likely  be moderate, relative to the size and financial ability of the broader group. The one-notch difference between the ratings of Sistema and MTSB reflects the  bank's weak performance to date and its limited strategic importance and synergy  within the group.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL LONG-TERM RATING, SUPPORT RATING An upgrade of Sistema would likely result in an upgrade of MTSB's support-driven  ratings. However, a prolonged period of weak performance at MTSB could  negatively impact the group's long-term commitment to the bank's development,  perhaps limiting the potential for rating upside. Failure of the parent to  provide timely support, if needed, could result in a downgrade of the  support-driven ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VIABILITY RATING (VR) MTSB's 'b-' VR reflects (i) currently weak asset quality and further risks  stemming from rapid (and therefore unseasoned) recent and planned growth of  unsecured high margin retail lending; (ii) its moderate, but vulnerable  capitalisation due to poor profitability; and (iii) the low transparency and  potential regulatory risks related to subsidiary East-West United Bank. However,  on the positive side the VR also considers MTSB's sticky funding and reasonable  liquidity position. For more details on VR drivers see "Fitch Affirms OJSC MTS Bank at 'B+'; Outlook  Stable" dated 19 November 2013 at www.fitchratings.com.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - VR Downward pressure on MTSB's VR could arise from material asset quality  deterioration and/or capital pressure. The VR could mainly benefit from  improvements in assets quality, resulting in stronger financial performance.  The rating actions are as follows:  Long-term IDR affirmed at 'B+'; Outlook revised to Positive Short-term IDR affirmed at 'B' National Long-term Rating affirmed at 'A-(rus)'; Outlook revised to Positive Viability Rating affirmed at 'b-' Support Rating affirmed at '4'
