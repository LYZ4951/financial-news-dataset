TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - Japan's banking industry group said on Thursday it will set up a separate administrator for Tibor interbank benchmark rates in April, with an independent panel of outsiders to monitor the rate-setting process.

At present, the Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) calculates and publishes Tokyo interbank offered rates, or Tibor. From now on, this work and the setting of guidelines for reference banks will be done by the JBA Tibor Administration. The new body has a panel of outsiders headed by Kazuhito Ikeo, a Keio University professor, to monitor compliance of reference banks. The change is part of global efforts to overhaul interbank benchmark rate-setting process, which have come under close scrutiny in the wake of rate-rigging scandals. There have been no accusations of wrongdoing involving Tibor.
