WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance is "approximately appropriate" and central bankers still don't have to adjust policies to ward off inflation, the Obama administration's nominee for a top position at the Fed said on Thursday.

"We can focus on unemployment," Stanley Fischer, U.S. President Barack Obama's pick for the No. 2 spot at the Fed, told lawmakers at a confirmation hearing. He said the central bank would have to think about trade-offs between unemployment and inflation down the road, but that "we're not there yet."
