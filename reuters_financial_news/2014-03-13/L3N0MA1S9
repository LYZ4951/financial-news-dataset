HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, March 13 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks rose on Thursday, pulling up Hong Kong's market, led by banking counters that could be the first ones joining an anticipated preferred shares pilot programme in the mainland.

Three sources with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that the China Securities Regulatory Commission is ready to launch the long-awaited pilot programme allowing listed companies to issue preferred shares, and could announce it as policy as soon as this weekend. [ID:nL3N0M91UU] At midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was up 0.5 percent at 21,999.79 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 1.4 percent.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also climbed 1.4 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> moved above 2,000 points by rising 1.3 percent to 2,022.96 points.  In Hong Kong, shares saw "just a slight recovery from their low," said Alex Wong, a director at Ample Finance Group. "Preferred shares can only solve a little bit of capital worry but it cannot solve the worries such as debt quality and interest margin (among Chinese banks) in the long run."   Wong said that as the overall outlook is still bearish, market sentiment improved a little on improved liquidity. He said resource, energy and bank stocks should rise if Chinese data due this afternoon is solid.   Data due at 0530 GMT includes industrial output, urban investment and retail sales. Index compiler MSCI said on Wednesday it plans to include China's mainland-based A shares in its benchmark emerging market index from May 2015, as the country gradually opens up its domestic yuan markets to foreign investors.
