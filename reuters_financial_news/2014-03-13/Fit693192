March 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The government plan to reduce costs and increase  revenue can make Portugal's electricity system sustainable and eliminate  outstanding tariff deficits (TDs) in the next 10 years, Fitch Ratings says.  Spain's ability to eliminate TDs remains considerably less certain.  Portugal's plan includes revising special tariffs on new renewable contracts,  and phasing out end-user regulated electricity tariffs by end-2015 (63% of  consumers on the regulated tariff at end-2013, down from 83% in 2012). We expect  these measures eventually to eliminate the imbalances that create TDs in  Portugal, and increase repayments.  Our analysis forecasts the creation of a new gross TD of EUR4bn until 2018,  after which the system will be in surplus. Total TDs outstanding will peak at  about EUR4.6bn in 2015, then fall sharply to 10% of this in 2020, and be fully  amortised by 2023, when the final payment of the 2009 TD is due. This bolsters  our view that a detailed agenda and supervision process, a hard deadline leading  to aggressive amortisation schedules for new TDs, and regulatory independence  make Portugal's aim of eliminating TDs credible.  Our belief in system sustainability and the stability of the legal framework for  TD recoverability supports the 'BBB(EXP)sf' ratings two notches above Portugal's  sovereign rating, we assigned to Tagus STC/Volta II, a securitisation of  Portuguese TD receivables. Sovereign ratings anchor TD securitisation ratings  because they generally capture macroeconomic risks that influence electricity  demand.  An economic slowdown could reduce electricity demand and increase the risk of  legislative intervention that compromised the roadmap. At present we consider  the risk of legislative interference low in Portugal, partly due to the EU, IMF,  and ECB's role in designing and monitoring electricity sector reform.  We believe that the level of TD generated by the electricity system in Spain has  become less sustainable. The latest estimate of the TD at FYE13 is EUR4.1bn,  partly due to withdrawal of previously committed government support. The  uncertainty created by other government interventions and legal initiatives  indicate persistent political interference in the sector and a lack of  systematic mechanisms to prevent TD growth. For example, the government said  that it will suspend quarterly wholesale power auctions that help set regulated  consumer electricity prices, but it is not yet clear when a new price-setting  formula will be implemented.  We recently downgraded five securitisations backed by Spanish electricity TD  credit rights to 'BBBsf' from 'BBB+sf'/Negative, bringing them into line with  the sovereign rating. The downgrades reflected the lack of a credible and  predictable plan to substantially reduce or end TDs. The Negative Outlooks  reflect our opinion that the risk of further political interference is high, and  the failure so far of regulatory initiatives to reduce TDs, which reached a  cumulative total close to EUR30bn, 211% of annual regulated revenues, at FYE13.
