BANGKOK, March 13 (Reuters) - Thai stocks rose to their highest in over three months on Thursday amid heavy buying in dividend-yielding stocks after the central bank cut interest rates while Indonesian shares traded near 6-month highs ahead of Bank Indonesia's interest rate meeting.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> was up 0.9 percent at 1,368.32, earlier touching 1,369.83, the highest since Dec. 11. Shares of energy explorer PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK>, state-run bank Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> and property developer AP Thailand <AP.BK> were among the outperformers in the top 30 high dividend stocks <.SETHD>. On Wednesday, the Bank of Thailand cut its benchmark interest rate <THCBIR=ECI> by 25 basis points to 2 percent, a level last seen in late 2010, to lift economic growth hurt by months of political unrest.
