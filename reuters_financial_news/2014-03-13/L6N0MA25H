MILAN, March 13 (Reuters) - Rating agency DBRS is concerned about the fragility of Italy's economic recovery, which leaves the country vulnerable to possible external shocks, but there are no risks of a downgrade, a senior analyst told Reuters on Thursday.

Toronto-based DBRS rates Rome at 'A low' with a negative outlook and is scheduled to review its assessment on both Italy and Spain on April 11. DBRS head of sovereign ratings Fergus McCormick said in an interview with Reuters that it was too early to say if the outlook could be raised to stable.
