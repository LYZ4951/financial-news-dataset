BUDAPEST, March 13 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank fined 35 banks and financial institutions a total 1.2 billion forints ($5.32 million) for unlawful hikes in fees and costs on Thursday and ordered them to reimburse their clients.

The central bank, which also performs financial supervisory functions, said the cost rises over a period from Jan. 1, 2012 to Dec. 31, 2013 breached the law in a number of aspects, such as a failure by banks to inform clients properly.
