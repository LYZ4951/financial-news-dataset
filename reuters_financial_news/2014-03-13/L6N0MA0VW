LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - A leading European share index edged off 1-month lows in cautious trading on Thursday, led by Germany's largest airline Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> after its profits beat expectations.

Lufthansa rose 6.7 percent to the top of the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> after it said it was confident of reaching goals set out under a wide-ranging restructuring programme and restored its dividend payout. [ID:nL6N0MA0GN] The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.1 percent at 1,309.11 points by 0811 GMT after closing 1.1 percent lower to a one-month low in the previous session, when it slipped below the 50 percent retracement of a rally from February 4 to 25. It has fallen more than 3 percent since March 6. Latest data from China giving fresh signs of the slowdown in economic growth in the world's second-largest economy kept investors jittery and mad major stock indexes vulnerable to further sell-offs, analysts said.
