March 13 (Reuters) - Gleacher & Co Inc <GLCH.O> said its board approved a plan to liquidate its assets and distribute them to shareholders, capping years of struggle that resulted in the company shutting its main investment banking business last year.

New York-based Gleacher & Co, founded by M&A veteran Eric Gleacher, never fully recovered from a slump in the merger and advisory business and last posted a profit in the December quarter of 2011. Gleacher left the company in January 2013. The company said on Thursday it expects to make an initial liquidating distribution of about $20 million, or $3.23 per share, to stockholders.

Apart from exiting the investment business, Gleacher sold its mortgage-origination unit, closed its equities and fixed income businesses and fired more than 100 traders and bankers in the last two years. The company also reported on Thursday a smaller fourth-quarter loss, helped by investment gains. Gleacher lost $2.9 million, or 37 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $11.2 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier.
