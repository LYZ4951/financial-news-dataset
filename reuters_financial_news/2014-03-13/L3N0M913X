BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Following are comments from China's Premier Li Keqiang at his news conference on the final day of China's yearly meeting of parliament:

CORRUPTION "The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government are firm in their will and determination to fight corruption. This is our consistent position. "Visible progress has been made in this regard and we will carry forward this campaign with perseverance."  ECONOMY "On the risks of shadow banking, we are enhancing oversight and have already set a timetable to push forward the implementation of Basel III rules. "China's economy still faces severe challenges this year and probably will face a more complicated situation. "We believe we have the ability, and all the means, to ensure that economic growth will stay within a reasonable range this year."  DEBT "We are reluctant to see defaults of financial products, but some cases are hard to avoid. We must enhance oversight and solve problems in a timely way to ensure no systemic and regional risks. "We have been paying great attention to risks from financial sectors and debt. "The result of a government audit showed that debt risks are generally under control, and the debt/GDP ratio of government debt is below the international warning line. "But we cannot overlook risk, and we are enhancing our efforts on regulatory measures."  MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT MH370
