FRANKFURT, March 13 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank reiterated in its monthly bulletin on Thursday that it would keep its policy highly accommodative and would take further action if required.

As usual, the editorial of the bank's bulletin was virtually identical to its main policy statement, read out by ECB President Mario Draghi last Thursday, when the bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 0.25 percent. "Overall, the Governing Council remains firmly determined to maintain the high degree of monetary accommodation and to take further decisive action if required," the ECB said. "The Governing Council is monitoring developments on money markets closely and is ready to consider all instruments available to it." Below is a list of articles and special sections the bulletin contains. The articles can often shed light on the ECB's thinking about key issues and give an insight into the type of analysis the bank uses to support its policy decisions. * Repercussions of the recent financial market tensions in emerging market economies 11 * Recent developments in the financial account of the euro area balance of payments * Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 13 November 2013 to 11 February 2014  * Debt of non-financial corporations: consolidated and non-consolidated measures  * Impact of services and non-energy industrial goods prices on the recent decline in HICP inflation
