SEOUL, March 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept interest rates unchanged for a 10th straight month on Thursday, as expected. Many economists say the Bank of Korea will hike later this year as a slow but steady economic recovery plays out.

The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate <KROCRT=ECI> steady at 2.50 percent, a media official said without elaborating. Governor Kim Choong-soo is due to hold a news conference from 11:20 a.m. (0220 GMT). ******************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Full story [ID:nS6N0IM01S] - All 24 analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast the central bank would keep the rate unchanged. Nineteen out of 21 analysts who forecast future policy change said the Bank of Korea is likely to raise rates this year or early next year.[ID:nL3N0M7251]  COMMENTARY: KONG DONG-RAK, FIXED INCOME ANALYST, HANWHA SECURITIES "South Korea is always vulnerable to changes in external conditions, so uncertainties about economies like China, U.S. and Europe are keeping the market from properly pricing in the gradual improvement in Korea's economic indicators." "Investors will focus on the Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol's assessment of the economy to judge the central bank's policy direction under his term during his confirmation hearings next week. But the expectations are that his views will not differ much from the central bank's current forecast for continued recovery in the coming months." "At this point we are expecting a rate hike in the fourth quarter, and I don't think the economic indicators that we have seen warrant any policy easing."   MARKET REACTION:
