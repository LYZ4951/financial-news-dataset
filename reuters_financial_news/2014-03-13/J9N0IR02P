JAKARTA, March 13 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank revised down its forecast for economic growth this year to around 5.5-5.9 percent, on slowing domestic consumption and investment, as well as sluggish exports.

The bank previously estimated the economy to expand at the lower end of a 5.8-6.2 percent range. On Thursday, Bank Indonesia (BI) kept its benchmark rate <BIPG> unchanged at 7.50 percent a for fourth consecutive month. The rate remained consistent with a 2014 inflation target at 3.5-5.5 percent, spokesman Tirta Segara said. However, the bank would stay vigilant regarding inflationary pressures from administered prices.
