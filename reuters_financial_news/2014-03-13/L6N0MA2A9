PARIS, March 13 (Reuters) - The banking industry will be able to generate profitability above its cost of capital and funding from investors in 12 to 18 months, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause said on Thursday.

"I would be quite positive that within another 12 to 18 months you will see the industry return," Krause told a conference in Paris, organised by the Economist.
