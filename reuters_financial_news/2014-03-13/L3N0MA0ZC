HONG KONG, March 13 (Reuters) - Shares in a Chinese theme park operator and real estate developer were set to open at least 7 percent weaker in their trading debuts in Hong Kong on Thursday, underscoring the tough market for new listings in the city.

Haichang Holdings <2255.HK>, which operates amusement parks in China, was indicated to open at HK$2.26 compared with an initial public offering price of HK$2.45 per share. The IPO, which raised $316 million, priced just above the middle of a HK$2.18 to HK$2.68 per share marketing range last week.
