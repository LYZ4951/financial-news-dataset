NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - European buyout firm Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP is in advanced talks to acquire education software provider Skillsoft Ltd for more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Charterhouse has emerged as the lead contender for Skillsoft following an auction that also drew a binding bid from Providence Equity Partners LLC. Charterhouse is now negotiating the final terms of a purchase agreement, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. The discussions are continuing and the outcome may yet change, the people cautioned.  Charterhouse, Providence Equity and Skillsoft's private equity owners -- Berkshire Partners LLC, Advent International Corp and Bain Capital LLC -- all declined to comment. Representatives for Skillsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Skillsoft provides electronic learning solutions to more than 6,000 customers globally, including companies and governments. It uses cloud computing, which allows clients to reduce costs by ditching bulky local servers for network-based software and storage in remote data centers. The Nashua, New Hampshire-based company was taken private by Berkshire Partners, Advent and Bain in 2010 for $1.1 billion. It reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $139.2 million for the 12 months ending Jan. 31, 2013, up from $111.1 million the year before. The corporate education and training market is highly fragmented and competitive, with low barriers to entry. One of Skillsoft's competitors, Cengage Learning, which is also a major textbook publisher, filed for Chapter 11 protection last summer and won court approval on Thursday to emerge from bankruptcy. Renaissance Learning Inc, another cloud-based educational software firm geared towards school children, said on Thursday it would be acquired by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC for $1.1 billion, just one month after Google's <GOOG.O> late-stage investment arm, Google Capital, invested in the same company at a $1 billion valuation. [ID:nL2N0M91Y5] Berkshire Partners, Advent and Bain committed at least $510 million in equity when they acquired Skillsoft in 2010, according to a credit research note at the time by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
