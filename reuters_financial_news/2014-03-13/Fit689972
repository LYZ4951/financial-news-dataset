March 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the Outlook is Stable on most of Tunisian leasing companies' National Long-Term Ratings, but the country's weak economic environment could limit the potential for upgrade.  The National Ratings of four out of eight rated Tunisian leasing companies are  driven by shareholder support. Shareholder's support is key for Arab  International Lease (AIL; AA+(tun)/Stable), Attijari Leasing (AL;  BB+(tun)/Stable), Arab Tunisian Lease <ATL.TN> (ATL; BBB(tun)/Negative) and Modern  Leasing <ML.TN> (ML; BBB(tun)/Stable). The National Ratings of these companies are  underpinned by Fitch's expectations of support from their majority shareholders,  in case of need. Fitch considers that the respective shareholders' propensity to  support AIL, AL, ATL and ML is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, Compagnie Internationale de Leasing's <CIL.TN> (CIL;  BBB-(tun)/Negative), El Wifack Leasing's (EWL; BBB-(tun)/Stable), Hannibal Lease  SA's (HL; BB-(tun)/Stable) and Tunisie Leasing's <TLS.TN> (TL; BBB+(tun)/ Stable)  National Ratings are based on Fitch's assessment of their standalone  creditworthiness. The ratings of EWL, HL and TL are sensitive to a material deterioration in asset  quality leading to an erosion of their capital position. Their ratings would  also be downgraded if their access to liquidity is constrained, either for bond  issuance or for bank credit lines. These, however, are not Fitch's central  scenario. A downgrade of CIL's ratings could result from continuous pressure on  asset quality, solvency and profitability ratios.  Potential for rating upgrades at EWL, HL and TL is limited as the Tunisian  fragile economic environment still weighs on these companies' asset quality and  liquidity. However, significant increases in capital ratios and sustained  improvements in asset quality could lead to an upgrade.
