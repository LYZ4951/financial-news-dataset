WASHINGTON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management <APO.N> is nearing a buyout of PetSmart Inc <PETM.O> for about $8 billion in what would be the largest leveraged deal for a U.S. company this year, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing unnamed sources.

"New York-based Apollo is in late-stage talks to buy PetSmart for about $8 billion following an auction process that has been under way for weeks, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential," Bloomberg said.
