ABU DHABI, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) approved rules effective from Sunday to introduce temporary suspensions for stocks if they fall by 5 percent, it said in a statement.

Suspensions would last for five minutes and would allow investors to review their trades and study information that was causing the stock to fall, it said.
