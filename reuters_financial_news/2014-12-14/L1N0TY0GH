NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group announced late Friday the results of its annual re-ranking of the Nasdaq 100 index <.NDX>, which will cause a reshuffling of several constituents.

Nasdaq <NDAQ.O> said it will add American Airlines Group <AAL.O>, Electronic Arts <EA.O> and Lam Research <LRCX.O>, with Expedia <EXPE.O>, F5 Networks <FFIV.O> and Maxim Integrated Products <MXIM.O> being removed from the index.  The exchange also said some new shares will be included in the index following a recent revision to its methodology that allows for multiple share classes of index components. They include Comcast Corp Class A Special <CMCSK.O>, Twenty-First Century Fox Class B <FOX.O> and Liberty Global plc Class C <LBTYK.O> shares.  The Nasdaq-100 index is composed of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market.
