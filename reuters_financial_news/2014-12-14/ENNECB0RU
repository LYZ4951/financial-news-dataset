SEOUL, Dec 15 (Reuters) - South Korea imported 567,611 tonnes of crude oil from Iran in November, up 6.5 percent from a year ago, preliminary data from Korea Customs Service showed on Monday.  That is equivalent to 4.2 million barrels, according to a Reuters calculation. The world's fifth-largest crude buyer imported a total 11.1 million tonnes of crude last month against 10.2 million  tonnes imported a year ago, the data also showed.  Final data for South Korea's crude oil imports last month will be published by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later the month. The KNOC data is considered the industry standard for South Korea's oil imports.   Keywords: OIL KOREA/IRAN
