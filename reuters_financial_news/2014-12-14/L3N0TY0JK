SYDNEY, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Australian shares are likely to fall for a fifth straight session on Monday as investors mull a plunging oil price, Chinese economic slowing, and what is expected to be a wider than expected forecast domestic budget deficit.

In a mid-year review, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey is expected to reveal that the budget deficit for the year to June 30, 2015 will blow out by about A$5 billion ($4.2 billion) to nearly A$35 billion. Hockey is expected to announce measures to cushion an economy facing its worst decline in terms of trade in more than half a century, including large cuts to services and spending.
