Oct 30 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) welcomed a ruling by a federal judge on Thursday allowing Stockton to exit bankruptcy in a plan that will not see pensions cut.

U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Klein gave Stockton, California, the green light to exit bankruptcy after more than two years of proceedings. His approval of the city's bankruptcy plan means that employee pensions administered by Calpers would not have to take a haircut. [ID:nL1N0SP2K1]
