NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Oct 29 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $1.6 billion to $1.064 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $6.5 billion to $1.032 trillion.
