SYDNEY, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to tick higher on Friday, supported by Wall Street and as investors digest earnings reports from Australia's top-tier banks, which reported rises in profits, though a dip in metals prices may cap gains.

The local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.5 percent to 5,483, a 6.8-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Thursday, snapping two sessions of losses.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> added 0.2 percent in early trade. Wall Street rose overnight, boosted by a strong reading on quarterly economic growth and by another round of upbeat earnings reports. Iron ore prices dipped overnight, with little sign Chinese buyers would risk big purchases faced with uncertain demands. Gold edged lower while copper fell more than 1.0 percent as the dollar rallied on strong U.S. growth data.  Macquarie Group <MQG.AX> posted a 35 percent rise in first-half net profit bolstered by its asset management division and a recent focus on housing loans. [ID:nL4N0SP8WV] Australia and New Zealand Banking Corp <ANZ.AX> posted a 10 percent rise in full-year cash profit, its fifth straight year of record profit.
