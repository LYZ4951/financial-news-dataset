TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Daiwa Securities Group <8601.T> reported a stronger-than-expected second-quarter net profit, as sales of wrap funds more than offset a decline in the market's enthusiasm over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policies.

Daiwa said its net profit in the July-September quarter rose to 37.0 billion yen ($339 million) from 35.5 billion yen a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 32.8 billion yen, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.
