Oct 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education will introduce stricter regulations next year in its latest attempt to improve the job prospects of those graduating from for-profit colleges and universities.

Under new regulations unveiled on Thursday and effective July 1, for-profit colleges will be at risk of losing federal aid should a typical graduate's annual loan repayments exceed 20 percent of discretionary income or 8 percent of total earnings. This is lower than the current threshold of 30 percent of discretionary income and 12 percent of total earnings. The U.S. for-profit education sector has faced tougher regulation ever since a series of government investigations in 2010 revealed high student debt, low graduation rates and poor job prospects for graduates. For-profit institutions, including Apollo Education Group Inc <APOL.O>, Corinthian Colleges Inc <COCO.O> and DeVry Education Group Inc <DV.N>, have been struggling to attract new students. "These regulations are a necessary step to ensure that colleges accepting federal funds protect students, cut costs and improve outcomes," U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a statement. The department said it estimates about 1,400 programs serving 840,000 students, of whom 99 percent study at for-profit institutions, would not pass the new accountability standards.
