LISBON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The collapse of the Espirito Santo banking family's business empire will not keep Portugal's economy from growing 1.5 percent next year, as forecast, but probably will keep it from expanding any further, the Portuguese prime minister said on Thursday.

"Various adverse scenarios of that impact applied to public accounts put the growth within the central projection, and the government sees no reason to revise it," Pedro Passos Coelho told parliament during discussions of the 2015 budget. He acknowledged the problems at Espirito Santo Group will have negative consequences, "which means that if it wasn't for this problem, we could possibly grow more and have more jobs". The bankruptcy of the group under a mountain of debt culminated in a 4.9 billion-euro state rescue of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) <BES.LS> in August after roiling financial markets.  The family had sold debt to many companies and investors and had stakes in various Portuguese companies, which makes after- effects of its demise likely for businesses. But the prime minister said that "whatever the impact, it will not have macroeconomic relevance." The government expects Portugal's economy to grow around 1 percent this year, for its first year of growth after a three-year recession caused by the euro zone debt crisis. That led to painful austerity measures under the terms of an international bailout. Lisbon exited the bailout in May.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  on Monday put Portugal's growth at 0.8 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2015.

Under the draft 2015 budget, which parliament will vote on in a first reading on Friday, Portugal will cut the budget deficit to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product next year from this year's projected 4.8 percent.
