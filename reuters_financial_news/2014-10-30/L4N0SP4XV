SINGAPORE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Singapore's third-biggest lender, United Overseas Bank <UOBH.SI>, on Thursday posted a rise of 18.7 percent in quarterly profit, helped by strong loan growth and fee income, beating expectations.

However the bank posted S$162 million ($126.73 million) in bad debt charges in the third quarter, up 90.5 percent from a year earlier due to a "few specific non-performing loan accounts" in Thailand and Indonesia. UOB earned S$866 million in the three months ending in September, up from S$730 million a year earlier. The result exceeded an average forecast of S$746 million from five analysts polled by Reuters.
