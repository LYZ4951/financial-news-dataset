DUBAI, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding <4280.SE>, the investment firm owned by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, posted a 20.5 percent rise in third-quarter net profit on Thursday, on the back of higher investment profits.

Kingdom made a net profit of 265 million riyals ($70.6 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to 219.9 million riyals in the same period a year earlier, it said in a bourse statement.  It attributed the rise to an increase in profits from investments and to lower finance charges.
