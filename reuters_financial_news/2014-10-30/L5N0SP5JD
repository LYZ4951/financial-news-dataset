BUDAPEST, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Hungarian lender OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> plans to make deep cuts to its costs in the medium term across its network of banks in Central and Eastern Europe, largely through increased use of its online platforms, a source with knowledge of its plans told Reuters.

The source said the bank planned to acquire a small Polish bank which has a good knowledge of online banking as a way to enhance OTP's own know-how and enable it to diversify away from the Hungarian market.
