WARSAW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Shares in the operator of the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) <GPW.WA> jumped 10 percent on Thursday as the company posted a rise in third-quarter profit and vowed to raise its dividend.

Central Europe's largest bourse operator adopted a new dividend policy that assumes it will spend more than 60 percent of its consolidated net profit on payouts. [ID:nL5N0SP0H3] It said it planned to return 2.4 zlotys ($0.72) per share to shareholders from its 2014 profit and 2.6 zlotys per share a year later. The previous dividend policy assumed payouts of 30-50 percent. "There are two drivers of today's move. The dividend and higher-than-expected profits," said a Warsaw-based trader. Cost cuts and higher income from WSE's commodity markets helped the bourse raise its third-quarter net profit by 15 percent year on year to 30 million zlotys.
