SINGAPORE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - DBS Group Holdings <DBSM.SI>, Singapore's biggest bank, on Friday posted a 17 percent rise in third-quarter net profit, beating expectations, as higher margins boosted loan pricing and investment banking fees more than doubled.

DBS said net profit came to S$1.008 billion ($789.04 million) for the July-September period, versus S$862 million in the same period a year earlier and above an average forecast of S$971 million from five analysts polled by Reuters.
