MILAN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> were suspended from trading after falling 5 percent as investors fretted over how Italy's third-largest bank would fill its 2.1 billion euro capital shortfall.

The bank has two weeks to submit a capital-boosting plan to the European Central Bank after failing a year-long review of lenders' balance sheets across the euro zone. "Until a solution is found to its problems Monte dei Paschi will remain under selling pressure and this is having an impact on all Italian banking shares," a Milan-based trader said. A second trader also mentioned concerns about Monte Paschi's future. Shares in smaller Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> were also suspended from trading after a 4.9 percent fall. Carige is the only other Italian bank that also must raise fresh cash following the ECB's health check. But Carige already has a pre-underwriting commitment from investment bank Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> for a capital increase of up to 650 million euros and its residual capital shortfall is of around 700 million euros. Italy's banking stock index lost 1.8 percent <.FT8300>.
