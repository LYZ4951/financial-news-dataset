ATHENS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Greek shares fell sharply in early Thursday trade with traders citing political risk and fears of snap elections prompting some investors to reduce exposure.

The Athens Stock Exchange's general index <.ATG> fell 4.6 percent at 0929 GMT, with banks <.FTATBNK> losing 8.9 pct. "The country's risk is up on political uncertainty and fears of possible early polls, prompting some investors to pull out", said Takis Zamanis, chief trader at Beta Securities. "Technically, support levels on the benchmark share index broke down, we fell below the 900-points mark and this also weighed on sentiment," he added.
