HONG KONG, Oct 30 (Reuters) - China financial institutions are rushing to expand their business beyond Hong Kong, aiming to broaden their investor base to Europe and the United Staets with yuan products.

Chinese asset managers and banks have long been keen to go abroad, but their overseas business did not really pick up until the past few years when products denominated in yuan began to bestow them competitiveness against strong foreign players. Asset manager GF International Investment Management told Reuters on Monday in an interview that it was looking to set up offices in New York and London next year to strengthen its distribution ability. [ID:nL4N0SM31G] "Our initial plan is to hire five to six people for each office and local hire is preferred especially for sales people," said Nathan Lin, chief executive officer at GF International Investment. The firm will cooperate with exchange-traded funds (ETF) provider Global X, which had $3.5 billion of assets under management by April, to launch a China bond ETF in New York within a month. Other money managers including China CSOP Asset Management and E Fund Management have already sold yuan products in Europe or the United States to meet growing demand there. Despite their smaller size and lack of international investment experience compared with famous foreign names, the Chinese managers are believed to have a better understanding of China's policies and thus better investment strategies.  "People's interest in China has increased so much as there are a lot of programs that are telling people that China is definitely opening up," said Jack Wang, chief marketing officer at CSOP Asset Management. "We see a lot of new clients coming to us this year, some of whom are very big and reputable foreign investors."  Not only asset managers, but Chinese banks have began to see benefits from quicker yuan internationalisation as investors and coporates' appetite to use and hold the "redback" is whetted by a slew of policies that enable greater access to the world's second-largest economy. Wang Chunhai, deputy general manager of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) Singapore branch, told Reuters their business did not see rapid growth until 2009 when Beijing launched a landmark pilot scheme to allow cross-border trade to be settled in yuan. "Chinese banks are boosted by the acceleration of yuan internationalisation as products offered by Chinese banks become competitive when they are linked with renminbi," he said. The branch's total yuan settlement volume amounted to 26.2 trillion yuan($4.29 trillion) as of Oct 23, within less than two years after it was announced as the yuan clearing bank for the city-state in February 2013.
