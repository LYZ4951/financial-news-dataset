MUNICH, Oct 30 (Reuters) - German public-sector lender BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] is repaying another tranche of state aid after striking a deal to sell the last of the toxic assets that brought it to the brink of failure in 2008.

Germany's second-biggest landesbank said on Thursday it will return 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 bln) to its state owner Bavaria, leaving it with 3 billion euros to hand back by 2019.  In the financial crisis, Bavaria injected 10 billion euros in capital into the lender and gave it 4.8 billion in guarantees for a 21-billion euro portfolio of complex securities that turned sour after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  The guarantee has become obsolete with the sale of a remainder of 6.5 billion euros in asset-backed securities (ABS) -- securities whose value is linked to developments in the U.S. housing market and European commercial real estate -- to international investors.

The banks declined to comment. According to trading data provider Empirasign, price indications ahead of the deal were 74.28 cents on the dollar for the US securities and 91.72 cents on the euro for the European assets.

[ID:nL6N0SG2VZ] While the Munich-based lender booked a loss of 1.2 billion euros on the ABS portfolio, the state of Bavaria benefited by collecting fees from the bank for providing the guarantees. "In the end, a profit of about 1.3 billion euros remains from this engagement of Bavaria at BayernLB," Bavaria's Finance Minister Markus Soeder said.
