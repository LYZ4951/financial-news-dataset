SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Agricultural Bank of China Ltd <1288.HK><601288.SS> (AgBank),the country's third-largest lender by market value, reported a 6 percent rise in third-quarter net profit, slightly below analysts' estimates.

The last of China's five biggest listed banks to report quarterly earnings, AgBank followed the others in showing a rise in its non-performing loan ratio as the country's economic slowdown hurts borrowers. Net profit rose 6 percent to 48.4 billion yuan ($7.92 billion) in the quarter, according to the bank's unaudited financial statements filed on Thursday. That was slightly below the average forecast of 50.4 billion yuan in a Reuters poll of analysts. AgBank's non-performing loan ratio increased to 1.29 percent at the end of September compared with 1.24 percent at end-June.
