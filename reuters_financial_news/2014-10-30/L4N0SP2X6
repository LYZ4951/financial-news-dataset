SEOUL, Oct 30 (Reuters) - South Korean shares closed lower on Thursday in response to a slightly more hawkish policy tone by the U.S Federal Reserve, but were off session lows after Samsung Electronics rallied on hopes of a near term turnaround in fortunes.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> shed 0.11 percent to close at 1,958.93 points, but pared losses of around 0.9 percent by late morning. The main bourse found some support as Samsung Electronics <005930.KS>, the largest listing on the KOSPI by market capitalization, rallied 4.5 percent on optimism of a fourth-quarter turnaround in the tech giant's fortunes. The South Korean won <KRW=> fell on Thursday, as the dollar rallied broadly on the back of hawkish undertones in the Fed's description on the state of the U.S economy.
