Oct 30 (Reuters) - Bank credit growth in Qatar accelerated to a six-month high of 12.4 percent year-on-year in September from 9.0 percent in the previous month, central bank data showed on Thursday.

Money supply (M2) growth eased to 8.6 percent from a five-month high of 13.5 percent at the end of August.  Non-resident deposits jumped 20.1 percent on an annual basis after a year of consecutive declines and edged up 0.2 percent month-on-month to 33.8 billion riyals ($9.3 billion).
