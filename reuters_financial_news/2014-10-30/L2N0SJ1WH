RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Brazil's largest homebuilders are likely to deliver weak third-quarter results as economic concerns led firms to put the brakes on new construction and focus on selling older inventory, a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts showed on Thursday.

New project launches and pre-sales of homes already under construction fell across the industry compared to the same quarter last year. Some analysts said builders held back launches due to the uncertainty around Brazil's presidential election this month and soccer's World Cup, which ended in July. Worries over a weak economy and the chance of higher unemployment also led many companies to concentrate on selling off completed units at lower prices. Analysts said those discounts could compress gross margins, especially if the firms were unable to bring down selling expenses.  Brazilian builders have struggled with a slower economy, which entered recession in the first half of the year and sparked fears of a longer-term impact on growth and consumer confidence. "Next year will continue to be uncertain with many question marks," Bradesco BBI analyst Luiz Mauricio Garcia wrote in a client note. "With lower volumes and little growth in 2015, we believe various players will probably focus on reducing general and administrative expenses." PDG Realty SA <PDGR3.SA>, which reports quarterly earnings after markets close on Thursday, is likely to be the worst performing builder in terms of net income this quarter, with analysts predicting a loss of 98.5 million reais, on average.  Most analysts blamed high expenses at the company and discounts granted on older inventory, but they were optimistic that cash flow would turn positive in the quarter. Analysts were split on the outlook for middle-market homebuilder Gafisa SA <GFSA3.SA>. Three expected the company to post a loss, estimating an average loss of 7.5 million reais ($3.13 million). The other four, on average, saw Gafisa earning 17.3 million reais in the quarter. Gafisa posted a year-earlier profit of 15.7 million reais. Most analysts focused on Gafisa's sales, general and administrative expenses, which remain high despite a slowdown in the pace of new project launches. High sales cancellations are also expected to hurt earnings. At MRV Engenharia SA <MRVE3.SA>, which concentrates on the low-income segment, net income should rise 11.5 percent to 116 million reais. The company has seen strong sales this year, although it still struggles with heavy cancellations. Cyrela Brazil Realty SA <CYRE3.SA>, Brazil's No. 1 homebuilder by market value, probably earned 185.6 million reais in the quarter, according to the average estimate of seven analysts. That would be up 6.1 percent from a year earlier. Analysts expect the company to perform well in the quarter despite weak presales and launches, mostly due to an accounting boost from sales in a large Rio de Janeiro housing development. Gafisa reports earnings on Nov. 4, while Cyrela and MRV both report on Nov. 13.
