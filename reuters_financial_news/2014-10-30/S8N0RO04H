MADRID, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Spain's postponed public offering of state-owned airports operator Aena has been put off until the first few months of 2015, a source close to the process said on Thursday.

A tender would be held shortly to pick an auditor to sign off on the so-called comfort letter needed for the listing prospectus, the source said.
