CAPE TOWN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - South Africa's Hosken Consolidated Investments <HCIJ.J> has appointed Chief Financial Officer Kevin Govender as the acting chief executive of its Sabido unit, HCI's CEO said on Thursday, following the high-profile exit of another executive.

Marcel Golding resigned as executive chairman of HCI and chief executive of its Sabido unit this week following a tussle with the board that he said was over editorial independence at South Africa's only free-to-air private broadcaster, a group company.
