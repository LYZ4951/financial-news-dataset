MOSCOW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Russian central bank said on Thursday it had provided $51.1 million at its first one-week dollar repo auction.

The repo was provided at an average yield of 2.1207 percent. The auction was the second to be held under a scheme to provide up to $50 billion in foreign currency repos to banks to offset a shortage of foreign currency liquidity.
