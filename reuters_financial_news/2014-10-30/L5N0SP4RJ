WARSAW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Poland's largest lender, PKO BP <PKO.WA>, is seen reporting a 15-percent jump in its third-quarter net profit, helped by the takeover of the Polish unit of Sweden's Nordea <NDA.ST>, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.

The state-run bank is expected to report a bottom line of 860 million zlotys ($257.6 million) for the third quarter, based on the average of estimates from 10 banks and brokerages. That would raise its net profit after the first nine months of the year to 2.5 billion zlotys.
