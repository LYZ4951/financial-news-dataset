FRANKFURT, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is seeking help from four major asset managers to carry out purchases of securitised private debt, which it expects will start in November as a key part of its stimulus measures to stave off deflation.

The ECB said on Thursday it had chosen Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, ING<ING.AS>, State Street <STT.N> and Amundi <CAGR.PA> to support its efforts to buy asset-backed securities (ABS).
