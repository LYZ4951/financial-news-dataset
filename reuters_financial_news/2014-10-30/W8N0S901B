WARSAW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Poland's fourth largest lender mBank <MBK.WA> reported a 9-percent rise in its third-quarter net profit, in line with market forecasts, thanks to higher net interest income and lower write-downs on bad loans, it said on Thursday.

The bank, a unit of Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, said its net profit stood at 315.5 million zlotys ($94.3 million)  compared to 321 million expected by analysts.
