WARSAW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Warsaw Stock Exchange <GPW.WA> has adopted a new dividend policy that assumes the company will spend more than 60 percent of its consolidated net profit on pay-outs, the company said in a statement on Wednesday night.

State-controlled WSE also said it plans a dividend of 2.4 zlotys ($0.7177) per share for 2014, and 2.6 zlotys per share for 2015. The previous dividend policy of Central Europe's largest bourse assumed pay-outs of 30-50 percent of net profits.
