SHANGHAI, Oct 30 (Reuters) - China's Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, which domestic investors see as the most important indicator of stock market sentiment, hit its highest level in 20 months after regulators said they would move to support consumption.

The SSEC rose 0.8 percent in morning trade to stand at 2,391.9 points by GMT 0600, marking its highest level since Feb. 2013, while the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings climbed 0.6 percent. The State Council, China's cabinet, said on Wednesday it would promote consumption in six sectors, including e-commerce, new energy, housing, tourism, education and sport.
