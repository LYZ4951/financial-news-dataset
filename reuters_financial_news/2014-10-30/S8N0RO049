MADRID, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Spanish government is seriously considering suspending a planned initial public offering of airport operator Aena, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.

State-owned Aena had last week postponed filing the prospectus for its planned $10 billion stock market listing although official sources at the company had said the operation would likely be given the government's green light on Friday.
