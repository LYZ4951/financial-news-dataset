MUMBAI, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose nearly 1 percent to a record high on Thursday as investors bet an improving economy and government reforms would allow the country to better withstand potential rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The 30-share BSE index <.BSESN> rose as much as 1.1 percent to an all-time high of 27,390.60, while the NSE index <.NSEI> gained as much as 1.12 percent to mark a record high of 8,181.55, surpassing their previous highs hit on Sept. 8. Exporters led gainers on the increased Fed optimism about the U.S. economy, with Infosys Ltd <INFY.NS> provisionally ending up 1.6 percent while rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd <TCS.NS> gaining 2.3 percent.
