Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority will name a long-time official, Richard Berry, as the new head of its securities arbitration unit, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Berry will replace the head of FINRA's arbitration unit, Linda Fienberg, who retires at the end of November after 18 years in her current job. He is presently the unit's director of case administration. FINRA, Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog, runs the system where investors and brokerage firms must resolve their legal disputes. Brokers must also typically arbitrate employment disputes through the system. A FINRA spokeswoman declined to comment. Berry could not be immediately reached for comment. FINRA had considered Berry and another internal candidate as  Fienberg's possible replacements since mid September, after the watchdog announced she was planning to retire. [ID:nL1N0RC2FC][ID:nL1N0R42CN] Berry has worked for FINRA and its predecessor organization, the National Association of Securities Dealers, since 1995. Berry has a law degree from the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, according to his LinkedIn profile.
