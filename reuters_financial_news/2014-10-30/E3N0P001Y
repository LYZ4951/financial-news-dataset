BOGOTA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank held the benchmark interest rate steady as expected on Thursday as benign inflation allows policymakers to continue to fuel the economy amid an uncertain global environment.

The seven-member board voted to maintain the lending rate at 4.5 percent for a second month, meeting the forecast of 31 out of 32 analysts in a Reuters survey this week.
