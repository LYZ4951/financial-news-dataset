MILAN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Moody's said on Thursday it might cut the credit ratings of Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> and Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> after pan-European health checks unveiled capital shortfalls for the two Italian banks.

The rating agency said Monte dei Paschi would find it difficult to cover the capital shortfall within the timeframe requested by the European Central Bank without further government support.  Moody's currently rates Monte dei Paschi's senior unsecured debt as B1 and Banca Carige's as Caa1, both speculative grade, or junk, ratings.
