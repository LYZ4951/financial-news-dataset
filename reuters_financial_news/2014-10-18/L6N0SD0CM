GENEVA, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization promised on Saturday that it would publish a full review of its handling of the Ebola crisis once the outbreak was under control, in response to a leaked document that appeared to acknowledge the WHO had failed to do enough.

The WHO said in a statement that it would not comment on the internal document cited in an Associated Press story on Friday The document, a first draft that had not been fact-checked, was "part of an on-going analysis of our response", it said.
