Oct 18 (Reuters) - Several potential buyers are preparing bids for U.S. shopping mall owner AmREIT Inc <AMRE.N> that could value the company as much as $26 a share, the Financial Times said on Saturday.

Citing unidentified sources, the FT said AmREIT had attracted interest from companies including rivals Edens and Weingarten Realty Investors <WRI.N> as well as Regency Centers Corp <REG.N>, which made an unsolicited offer to buy AmREIT in July. Bids are expected by the end of October at prices likely to range between $25 and $26 a share, the FT said, citing the sources. AmREIT shares closed at $22.02 on Friday, close to Regency's July offer of $22 per share, which valued the company about $433 million. [ID:nL4N0PL4K3] Following Regency's July offer, AmREIT hired investment bank Jefferies to explore its options, the paper said.
