DUBAI, April 13 (Reuters) - Dubai-based investment bank Shuaa Capital reported 8.2 million dirhams ($2.2 million) in first-quarter net profit on Sunday, driven by lending and investment banking fees.

This compares to a net loss of 5.9 million dirhams in the same quarter last year, the company said in a bourse statement. Revenues rose 77 percent to 64 million dirhams. Shuaa, once a symbol of the investment banking sector's potential in the region, was hit hard by the financial crisis that weighed on Dubai between 2009 and 2011.  The company, like many other regional investment firms, struggled to stay afloat after a slump in the value of its investment portfolio.
