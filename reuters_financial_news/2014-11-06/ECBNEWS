FRANKFURT, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept interest rates at record lows at it policy meeting on Thursday, waiting to see how stimulus measures laid out over the summer unfold.

BALANCE SHEET TO RETURN TOWARDS EARLY 2012 LEVEL  "We started last month purchasing covered bonds under our new programme. We will also soon start to purchase asset-backed securities. The programmes will last for at least two years. Together with a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until June 2016 these asset purchases will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it had at the beginning of 2012."
