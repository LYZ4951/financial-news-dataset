FRANKFURT, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Commerzbank's <CBKG.DE> third-quarter net profit tripled to 225 million euros as earnings in its corporate and retail banking units rose and due to a steep fall off in bad loans.

Germany's second-biggest lender beat analysts' expectations, which had estimated a net profit of 192 million euros. [ID:nL6N0NO2UQ]
