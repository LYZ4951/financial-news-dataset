BERLIN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Germany's Continental <CONG.DE> is unable to complete its  acquisition of U.S. rubber firm Veyance Technologies and may need to sell one of the target company's divisions to win U.S. regulatory approval, Bilanz magazine reported on Thursday.

Continental announced the purchase of the U.S.-based maker of industrial hoses and belting for 1.4 billion euros ($1.75 billion) in February and had been expecting antitrust approval in the fourth quarter. [ID:nL5N0LF2TM] But U.S. authorities have voiced misgivings about the deal, one of Continental's biggest to date, as it would create a market-dominating position for Veyance and the German auto parts and tyre maker's Contitech division, Bilanz said. Continental declined to comment, adding it still expects to wrap up the Veyance takeover by the end of this year. Continental is aiming to sell Veyance's air-spring division and has already found potential bidders for the unit which has annual sales of around 60 million euros, Bilanz reported, without citing the source of the information. By taking over Carlyle Group's <CG.O> Veyance, the auto parts and tyre maker is seeking to trim reliance on volatile car markets following a six-year auto slump in its core European sales region.
