PRAGUE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Czech lender Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR> reported third-quarter net profit of 3.27 billion crowns ($147.35 million), beating market forecasts thanks to lower risk costs and higher-than-expected net interest income.

The profit figure represented a year-on-year rise of 0.6 percent. Analysts in a Reuters poll had on average forecast attributable net profit of 3.14 billion crowns in the quarter. [ID:nL6N0SV2MK] The Czech Republic's third-biggest bank by assets, which is 60 percent owned by France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, said its capital adequacy stood at 17.1 percent - above its target of 15-16 percent. It repeated it was reviewing its dividend guidance of paying out 60-70 percent of net profit.
