WARSAW, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Polish mid-sized lender Alior Bank <ALRR.WA> reported a 69-percent rise in its third-quarter net profit, above market forecasts, thanks to higher net interest and fee income, it said on Thursday.

The bank said its net profit stood at 70 million zlotys ($21 million) compared to 64 million expected by analysts.
