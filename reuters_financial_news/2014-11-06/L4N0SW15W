SYDNEY, November 6 (Reuters) - Australian shares gave up early advances to be lower by mid-session on Thursday as investors sold down banks before they trade ex-dividend and falling iron ore prices dragged down miners.

An unusual move by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to re-state past employment data also weighed on sentiment, traders and economists said, because it raised doubts about the veracity of official jobs data. Stocks rallied at the open on hopes that a sweeping Republican mid-term election victory might inject momentum into the United States economy, but quickly retreated as investors cashed in on bank stocks before several banks trade ex-dividend next week. "People are taking profits because the banks have rallied pretty hard from early October," said Quay Equities head of trading Tristan K'Nell. "A few of them are probably seeing that the profit that they make from the trades is better than the risk of holding the stock into ex-dividend." Largely unsurprising monthly employment data was overshadowed by questions about why the statistics bureau which   compiles it was forced to revise several previous months' figures, K'Nell added.
