LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - British house prices fell unexpectedly in October, adding to signs that the housing market is slowing and causing the annual rate of house price growth to fall to its lowest since June, mortgage lender Halifax said on Thursday.

House prices dropped by 0.4 percent in October compared to forecasts for a 0.4 percent rise, and September's 0.6 percent increase was revised down to 0.4 percent.
