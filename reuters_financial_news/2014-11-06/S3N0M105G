STOCKHOLM, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Getting Swedish inflation back to target quickly has become more important if the central bank's 2 percent target is to remain credible, Riksbank Deputy Governor Martin Floden said on Thursday.

"As the period with low inflation has become more prolonged than expected, it has become increasingly important to quickly bring inflation back to higher levels," Floden said in a speech published by the Riksbank. Floden said that there were many indications, however, that inflationary pressure would remain low in the period ahead.
