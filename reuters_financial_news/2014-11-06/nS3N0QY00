STOCKHOLM, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Inflation is very low, but there is not a big risk the country faces falling into a deflationary spiral, Riksbank Deputy Governor Martin Floden said on Thursday.

"I don't think the risk that we are going to land in a problematic deflationary economy is particularly big," Floden said. "The risk is bigger in the euro area where inflation is as low but there is much weaker growth."
