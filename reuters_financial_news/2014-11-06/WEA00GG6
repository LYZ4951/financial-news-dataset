HELSINKI, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Finnish financial holding company Sampo <SAMAS.HE> on Thursday upgraded the full-year outlook for its property and casualty insurance arm If, as its strong position across the Nordic region offset country-specific setbacks in the third quarter.

As expected, Sampo changed the target range for If's full-year combined ratio to 88-90 percent from a previous 88-91 percent. A lower figure indicates better profitability. [ID:nL6N0ST3FH]If's third-quarter ratio improved to 86.9 percent from 87.2 percent a year earlier, compared with analysts' average expectations of 87.6 percent in Reuters poll.
