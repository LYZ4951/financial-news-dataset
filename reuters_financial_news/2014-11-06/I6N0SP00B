MILAN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Italian insurer Generali <GASI.MI> will be in a position to  increase its dividend on 2014 results, the group's CFO said on Thursday.

"Given our asset base situation, we feel we are in a position to remove the 40 percent payout ceiling (we imposed) and so we reckon we can pay a higher dividend," Alberto Minali said in a conference call with journalists on nine-month results.
