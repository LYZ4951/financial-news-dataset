CAIRO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Egypt will repay a $2.5 billion deposit to Qatar at the end of November, bringing to $6 billion the deposits it has returned to the Gulf Arab gas exporter since last year's ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, a central bank source said on Thursday.

Egypt has one Qatari deposit of $500 million outstanding, which is due to be repaid in the second half of 2015, the source told Reuters.  "Qatar made a formal request in the last few days for the return of an outstanding deposit of $2.5 billion and the central bank will return the deposit at the end of November," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
