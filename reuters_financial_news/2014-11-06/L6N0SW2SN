BRUSSELS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will approve on Thursday the disbursement of the next tranche of bailout loans for Cyprus after the country met the remaining two conditions for the payout, a document prepared for the meeting showed.

To get the 350-million-euro tranche from the European Stability Mechanism -- the euro zone bailout fund -- Nicosia had to amend laws on foreclosures and forced sales of mortgaged property in line with a deal with its international lenders.
