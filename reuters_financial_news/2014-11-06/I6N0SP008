MILAN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Italian insurer Generali <GASI.MI> said on Thursday its operating profit in the first nine months rose 12.8 percent, boosted by a solid performance in both life and non-life business.

In a statement Europe's third-largest insurer by market value said its nine-month operating profit was 3.677 billion euros ($4.6 billion), above an analyst consensus provided by the company of 3.618 billion euros. Generali said it expected to post a better operating result this year compared to 2013.
