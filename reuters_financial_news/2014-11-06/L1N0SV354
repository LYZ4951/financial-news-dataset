Nov 6 (Reuters) - Canadian engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc <SNC.TO> cut its full-year earnings forecast as it reported a third-quarter profit on Thursday, citing weakness in its mining business and other challenges, and said it would reduce its workforce by 9 percent over the next 18 months.

The Montreal-based company said it now expected earnings between C$2.15 and C$2.40 a share for 2014, down from its previous forecast of between C$2.80 and C$3.05 a share.
