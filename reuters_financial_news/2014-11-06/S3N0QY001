STOCKHOLM, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Swedish monetary policy must focus on inflation now and cannot take into account other factors, Riksbank Deputy Governor Martin Floden said on Thursday.

"Monetary policy can't focus on any other factors, at least currently. The top priority is to bring up inflation," Floden said in a speech. Several members of the central bank's board have expressed concerns about household debt levels in Sweden in recent years despite inflation that has undershot the bank's 2 percent target.
