SAO PAULO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Net income at Brazil's Cetip SA Mercados Organizados likely rose to a record in the third quarter as clearing and custody revenue weathered market volatility and a recovery in car sales bolstered income from auto loan liens, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.

Cetip, Latin America's largest securities clearinghouse, is expected to earn 109 million reais ($43 million) in the third quarter, up 16.2 percent from a year earlier, a poll of five analysts found. The analysts expect profit to be 9.2 percent greater than in the second quarter.  Almost four years of weak economic growth have stifled investor confidence in Brazil. This curbed financial-market inflows and triggered price volatility in the bond and derivatives markets where Cetip operates as a clearinghouse and a depositary company. Cetip will unveil results after market close on Thursday. Revenue at the securities unit, which accounts for about two-thirds of sales, rose to 201 million reais in the wake of higher over-the-counter custody and clearing transactions, the poll found. A 1.6 percent rise in domestic auto sales in the quarter helped propel sales of auto loan liens, the poll showed. While the poll expects revenue from this business to expand 5.1 percent to 107 million reais, the unit is "still suffering from the lack of appetite among commercial banks to lend for new vehicle and motorcycle purchases," said Domingos Falavina, an analyst at JPMorgan Securities. On a quarterly basis, net revenue probably rose 6 percent to 258 million reais, while general expenses were down 4.9 percent, the poll found. Sales, general and administrative expenses rose 5.6 percent on an annual basis, with the company still feeling the pinch of an increase in headcount, wages and the cost of outsourced services, analysts said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, an indicator of profitability in core operations, rose to 177 million reais. EBITDA, as the indicator is known, remained almost unchanged as a proportion of revenue on a quarterly basis, the poll found. The following are estimates for third-quarter earnings at Cetip.
