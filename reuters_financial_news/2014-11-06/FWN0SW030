LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - British insurer RSA <RSA.L> said premiums fell due to soft markets and its ongoing restructuring plans.

Net written premiums of 5.7 billion pounds ($9.12 billion)  were down 9 percent, the company said in a trading statement on Thursday. Tangible equity, the company's measure of net assets, rose to 2.9 billion pounds in the third quarter from 2.6 billion in the previous quarter.
