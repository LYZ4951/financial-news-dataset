Nov 6 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc <AGN.N> on Thursday said that it is currently in discussions with another party that a source familiar with the situation identified as Actavis Inc <ACT.N>, just days after the company disclosed that it had been approached.

The discussions about a potential merger transaction could lead to "negotiations," Allergan said in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its Dec. 18 meeting with shareholders. Allergan is fighting a $54 billion hostile takeover by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International <VRX.TO> and Pershing Square Capital Management, saying that Allergan's growth will be diminished and that Valeant will cut costs too deeply.
