FRANKFURT, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> expects to keep up its growth momentum over the coming quarters, despite a slightly 'less benign' macroeconomic environment in the last months of the year, Chief Financial Officer Stephan Engels said.

"In the core bank, I would see no reason to assume the trend stopping that we have now seen for the last three quarters," Engels said on an analyst call on Thursday. The so-called core bank excludes the lender's large run-off portfolio of ailing assets for sale.
