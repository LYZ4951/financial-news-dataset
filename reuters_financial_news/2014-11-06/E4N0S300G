BRASILIA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank will remain especially vigilant to battle persistently high inflation, the bank said in the minutes of its last rate-setting meeting released on Thursday.

The bank last week surprised markets by raising its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> by 25 basis points to 11.25 percent, resuming monetary tightening after an acceleration in price gains raised inflation expectations.
