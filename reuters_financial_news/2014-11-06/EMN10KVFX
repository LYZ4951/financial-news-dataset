NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Nov 5 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $8.7 billion to $1.073 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $0.8 billion to $1.031 trillion.
