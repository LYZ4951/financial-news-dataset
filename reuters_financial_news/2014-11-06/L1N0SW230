CHICAGO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Clearinghouses like those operated by CME Group <CME.N> and Intercontinental Exchange <ICE.N> should be subject to stricter oversight, including coordinated stress tests, to prevent failure in the face of a financial shock, a top Federal Reserve official said on Thursday.

"Clearing members and regulators needs a more systematic view of what stress tests are performed, at what frequency,  with what assumptions, and with what results," said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, in prepared remarks at the Chicago Federal Reserve.
