SOFIA, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's new government will propose former deputy finance minister and bank executive Vladislav Goranov as the new finance minister, GERB party leader Boiko Borisov said on Thursday.

Goranov, 37, is a member of the centre-right GERB party that won an October parliamentary election. He became chief executive of Municipal Bank, a lender controlled by Sofia's municipality, this June. He previously served as a deputy finance minister in charge of the budget in Borisov's earlier government, which fell from power in 2013.
