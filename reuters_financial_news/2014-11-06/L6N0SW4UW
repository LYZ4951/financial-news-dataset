LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Songbird Estates <SBDE.L>, the majority owner of London's Canary Wharf estate, said it had received a joint preliminary approach from Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield Property Partners regarding a possible takeover.

"The board of Songbird will consider this approach in light of what is in the best interests of the shareholders in the company as a whole and in the meantime Songbird shareholders are advised to take no action," the company said in a statement on Thursday.  The QIA, the country's sovereign wealth fund, already owns 28.6 percent of Songbird. Brookfield Property Partners <BPY.N> owns, operates and invests in office and industrial property. The pair have until Dec. 4 to make a firm intention to make an offer for the company.
