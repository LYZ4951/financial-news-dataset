PARIS, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said banks in Europe will still face regulatory pressure to refocus their business models over the coming years and the French bank will be on the lookout for small and mid-sized acquisitions.    "We are happy to look at opportunities, but at this stage I don't see many things, there might be more things in 2015 or 2016," Odea said during a conference call with analysts.
