PRAGUE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Czech lender Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR> is reviewing its dividend policy to pay out more than 70 percent of its profit and is looking at a range going up to 100 percent, Chief Financial Officer Libor Loefler said on Thursday.

The Czech Republic's third-biggest bank by assets, majority owned by Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, said earlier its capital adequacy stood at 17.1 percent - above its target of 15-16 percent - and repeated it was reviewing its dividend guidance of paying out 60-70 percent of net profit.
