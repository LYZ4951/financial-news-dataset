SEOUL, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> closed nearly flat on Thursday, bouncing back from steep falls that occurred after a top finance ministry official said the government will manage the local currency to move in line with the Japanese yen <JPY=>.

The comments from Vice Finance Minister Joo Hyung-hwan sednt the won tumbling 1.2 percent to an intraday low of 1,096.8 per dollar, the lowest level seen since Sept 6, 2013.[ID:nL4N0SW1EI] The won <KRW=> later tracked a recovery in the yen, which had struck levels unseen in seven years. The South Korean currency closed in domestic trade at 1,083.8 versus the dollar, a tad weaker than Wednesday's close at 1,083.6. The won has now posted a six-day losing streak, weakening 3.5 percent since Friday, when the Bank of Japan surprised markets by ramping up its bond-buying stimulus programme.  South Korean shares drifted higher on Thursday, as bargain hunters picked up exporters whose stocks had been rattled by fears that a rapidly weakening yen would make their Japanese rivals more price competitive. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> edged 0.26 percent higher to close at 1,936.48 points.
