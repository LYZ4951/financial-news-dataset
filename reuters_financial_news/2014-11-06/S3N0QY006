STOCKHOLM, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Introducing stricter rules that would force borrowers to paydown mortgages would not have a dramatic effect on households if introduced in the right way, Riksbank Deputy Governor Martin Floden said on Thursday.

"A new amortisation behaviour, especially if it only includes new mortgage borrowers ... if it is designed in the right way wouldn't have such dramatic consequences," Floden said. "I don't think anyone would recommend an amortisation requirement or an amortisation behaviour that would have a dramatic effect on household consumption over the coming years."
