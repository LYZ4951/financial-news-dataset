CAIRO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound <EGP=> held steady on Thursday both at a central bank dollar sale and on the black market.

The bank said it had sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from the previous sale on Wednesday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. The bank offered $40 million on Monday. In the unofficial market, the pound was trading at 7.50 to the dollar at midday, one trader said, also unchanged from earlier in the week.
