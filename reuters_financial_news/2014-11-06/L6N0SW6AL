LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Switzerland's UBS <UBSN.VX> and France's Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> will not have to hold as much extra capital as previously expected after regulators said they were less systemically important than a year ago.

The Financial Stability Board on Thursday issued a list of 30 banks considered the most global systemically important, dubbed G-SIBs, who have to hold extra capital of between 1 and 2.5 percent to make them less likely to fail and cause havoc in financial markets. The FSB, which coordinates financial regulation worldwide, added Agricultural Bank of China <601288.SS> to this year's list of most important banks.
