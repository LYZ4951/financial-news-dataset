MUMBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday named chief executive officers for four state-owned lenders, as part of plans to reform a sector constrained by a pile of bad loans and lagging private peers in profitability.

R. Koteeswaran was named as managing director and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank <IOBK.NS>, while P. Srinivas will become MD and CEO of United Bank of India <UBOI.NS>, a finance ministry statement said.  Animesh Chauhan was named MD and CEO of Oriental Bank of Commerce <ORBC.NS>, and Kishore Sansi will be MD and CEO of Vijaya Bank <VJBK.NS>. The appointments come ahead of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's two-day meeting with public sector banks, which account for nearly three quarters of banking assets in India.  The appointments also break with the tradition of having the heads of state-run banks act as both chairman and managing director. The government instead wants to install non-executive chairmen at most public sector lenders.   The government will soon announce a head for Syndicate Bank Ltd <SBNK.NS>, it said, but delayed naming chiefs for three bigger state-owned banks - Bank of Baroda <BOB.NS>, Punjab National Bank <PNBK.NS> and Canara Bank <CNBK.NS>.
