DUBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Turkish subsidiary of Kuwait Finance House (KFH) <KFIN.KW> has secured a $350 million syndicated Islamic loan, Kuwait's largest lender said on Wednesday.

ABC Islamic Bank, the Islamic unit of Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Barwa Bank, Emirates NBD Capital, the Saudi Arabian subsidiary of Emirates NBD, Noor Bank and Qatar Islamic Bank were the initial mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners to the deal, KFH said.
