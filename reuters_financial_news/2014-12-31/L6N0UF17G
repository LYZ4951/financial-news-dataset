SARAJEVO, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Bosnia's central bank governor said on Wednesday he expected the Bosnian economy to recover from years of stagnation and grow 2.5 percent in 2015 as he was hopeful the country would end its crippling political deadlock and push through economic reforms.

Central Bank Governor Kemal Kozaric told Reuters in an interview that the Bosnian economy grew an estimated 0.7 percent this year, and that the bank twice cut its growth forecasts for 2014 because of widespread flooding in May and August. Bosnia's unwieldy post-war system of ethnic power-sharing means it has yet to form a national government after an October election, but a majority in the new lower house of parliament has promised to pursue reforms and unlock EU funds. The European Commission has earmarked 166 million euros until 2017 for Bosnia's reform programme in a drive to revive the country's bid to join the EU. [ID:nL6N0U03MR]  "Catastrophic floods slowed down a mild recovery but we expect the formation of new governments ... which will be devoted to the economy, to fighting the grey economy and unemployment in their first year in the job," Kozaric said. The grey economy -- transactions evading tax and other regulations -- accounts for nearly 30 percent of Bosnia's overall output, while unemployment is among the highest in Europe at 27.5 percent, Kozaric said. The 2014 floods caused around 2 billion euros worth of damage in Bosnia, prompting international donors to pledge more than 800 million euros in aid and loans.  The IMF has predicted that Bosnia's economy will grow by close to 1 percent in 2014 and 2.8 percent in 2015. [ID: nL6N0TW3FV] Kozaric said he expected foreign investment to rise in 2015 after it fell to 468 million marka ($290 million) in 2014 due to the political impasse and sluggish euro zone recovery. Non-performing loans rose to 15.6 percent of total loans in 2014 from 15.1 percent in 2013, he said. These loans posed the main threat to an otherwise stable and liquid banking sector, although he did not expect them to increase further, he said. Kozaric also said the liquidation of private lender Bobar Banka <BBRB.BJ> last week was an isolated case and an example of bad risk management. [ID: nL6N0U811I] Bosnia's two autonomous regions were working on new banking laws that should be ready by March, he said. These would "create a legal framework to allow the purchase and sale of bad loans," Kozaric said.
