KAMPALA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Uganda's central bank said on Wednesday it cancelled a scheduled auction of two and five-year treasury bonds after would-be investors sought unacceptably high returns.    A total of 180 billion shillings ($65 million) of the re-opened two- and new five-year notes was on offer.

In a statement Bank of Uganda (BoU) said it had scrapped the sale "due to unacceptably very high yields submitted by the investing public." At their last sale on Dec. 3, the two-year notes fetched a weighted average yield of 14.322 percent, up from 13.704 percent. The 5-year bonds had a yield of 14.385 percent when they were last auctioned on Nov. 5, up from a previous rate of 13.935 percent.
