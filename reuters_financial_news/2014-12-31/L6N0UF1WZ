LISBON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Bank of Portugal said on Wednesday that 17 institutions have expressed interest in the sale of Novo Banco, the bank created after the collapse of Banco Espirito Santo in August.

The Bank of Portugal said in a statement it would not name the 17 institutions in this first phase of the sale of Novo Banco, which is expected to be finalised in the second quarter of 2015. In this first phase of the sale, institutions only had to express their potential interest in Novo Banco.
