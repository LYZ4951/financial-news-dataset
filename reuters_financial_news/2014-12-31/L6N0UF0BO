MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Russian government bought 39.95 billion roubles ($723 million) worth of Gazprombank's preference shares to support the banking system, Gazprombank said in a statement on Wednesday.

Gazprombank said the government bought the shares on Tuesday using money the bank had returned to the state by repaying subordinated deposits it received earlier.
