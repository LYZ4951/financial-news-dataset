FRANKFURT, Dec 31 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet sees a risk that recent monetary stimulus will not be sufficient to revive the economy, especially as weak oil prices may tip inflation into negative territory "during a substantial part of 2015".

The ECB chief economist said the central bank was closely monitoring how the fall in oil prices was affecting the outlook for price stability, but he added that had the ECB had some interest rate margin left, "there would have been a unanimous decision to cut rates". "If my assessment is that there is a need for further accommodation, and if I were willing to cut rates if that had been possible, then I should not be paralysed by the fact that the only option is to buy sovereign bonds," Praet said.
