April 25 (Reuters) - A committee created by a U.S. bankruptcy court to represent Detroit's retired workers said on Friday it reached an agreement in principal with the city over pensions and healthcare.

The agreement, subject to documentation, would permit the committee to support Detroit's plan to adjust $18 billion of debt and exit the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, according to a statement issued by Dentons, the committee's law firm.
