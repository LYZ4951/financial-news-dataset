NEW YORK, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Bidding at the U.S. seven-year Treasuries note auction on Wednesday was the weakest in more than a year as some traders sat on the sidelines due to worries about the Federal Reserve possibly raising interest rates in mid-2015.

The ratio of the amount of bids for the $29 billion in the latest seven-year government note issue offered came in 2.39, the Treasury Department said. [ID:nZXN0DCE00]
