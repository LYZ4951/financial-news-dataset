HONG KONG, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Property developer Greentown China Holdings Ltd <3900.HK> said state-owned China Communications Construction Group (Limited) (CCCG) is buying a 24.29 percent stake in it for about $775 million, days after a planned stake sale to another firm failed.

CCCG, the controlling shareholder of China Communications Construction Co. Ltd <601800.SS> <1800.HK>, has agreed to buy a total 524.85 million shares from three Greentown shareholders, including Shou Bainian, Song Weiping and Xia Yibo, at HK$11.46 each, Greentown said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse on Wednesday.  The price represented an 80.76 percent premium over Greentown shares' last close. Greentown shares fell to a 30-month low on Friday after a stake sale to peer Sunac China Holdings <1918.HK> was terminated. [ID:nWNAS00BDK] Trading in Greentown shares, which was suspended before markets opened on Monday, will resume on Wednesday.
