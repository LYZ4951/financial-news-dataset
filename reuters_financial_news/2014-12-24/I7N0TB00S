ISTANBUL, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank left its main interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, opting to keep policy tight as it awaits a sustained improvement in inflation expectations.

Those expectations have come down due to falls in oil and commodity prices, but only one of 18 economists in a Reuters poll had expected the bank to cut key rates on Wednesday.
