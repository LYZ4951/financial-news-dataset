Dec 24 (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages rose last week as activity picked up and rates fell, an industry group said on Wednesday.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose 0.9 percent in the week ended December 19. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose 1.1 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 1.3 percent.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. mortgage data: http://link.reuters.com/guv37s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.02 percent in the week, down 4 basis points from 4.06 percent the week before.
