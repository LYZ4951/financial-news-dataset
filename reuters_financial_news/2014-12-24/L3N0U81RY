HANOI, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.56 percent by Wednesday's break, in line with global markets thanks to surprisingly robust U.S. economic growth.

Risk appetite got a helping hand from revised data showing the U.S. economy grew at a 5.0 percent clip in the third quarter, its quickest pace in 11 years and the strongest sign yet that growth has decisively shifted into higher gear. [ID:nL1N0U70RD] PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's biggest listed firm by market value, advanced 1.43 percent and food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> rose 1.23 percent. But total trading volume fell to 35 million shares, well below the five-day average of 108 million, due to the holiday season. Top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> underperformed with a 1.79 percent fall, after the firm announced resignation and changes in key official positions on Tuesday. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).  VN Index540.87   PREV.
