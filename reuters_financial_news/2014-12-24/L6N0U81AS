LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Bid speculation drove up the shares of medical devices maker Smith & Nephew <SN.L> on Wednesday, allowing it to outpace sluggish European stock markets in a shortened session ahead of the Christmas break.

The 7.7 percent jump in Smith & Nephew, after Bloomberg News reported U.S. rival Stryker <SYK.N> was planning a takeover offer for it, allowed Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> to end 0.2 percent higher at 6,609.93 points. [ID:nL3N0U73P7]  France's CAC <.FCHI> ended down 0.4 percent as data showing another set of record unemployment figures in France weighed on the Paris market. [ID:nP6N0T300W] By contrast, data showed that British workers' productivity had a long-awaited improvement in the third quarter of this year, highlighting how Britain has managed to avoid the worst of the economic slump afflicting the euro zone. [ID:nL6N0U80UB] "Productivity has been a sore spot for the UK economy recently, so a positive figure could not have come at a better time," said Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell. Spain's IBEX <.IBEX> equity index was flat, while the cash markets for both Milan and Frankfurt's DAX <.GDAXI> were closed. The DAX is up 4 percent in 2014, beating a 2 percent dip on the FTSE 100 and a flat performance on France's CAC.
