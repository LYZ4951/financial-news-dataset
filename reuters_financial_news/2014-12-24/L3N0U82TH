COLOMBO, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks rose on Wednesday, with trading in development lender DFCC Bank <DFCC.CM> boosting turnover in otherwise thin pre-Christmas trade, shrugging off concerns over political uncertainty ahead of upcoming elections dented sentiment.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa's United People's Freedom Alliance lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament for the first time in more than four years after two ruling party legislators, including a cabinet minister, defected to join the opposition on Monday.
