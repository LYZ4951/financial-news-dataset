DUBAI, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The board of Saudi British Bank <1060.SE>, an affiliate of HSBC Holdings <HSBA.L>, has recommended boosting the bank's capital by 50 percent to 15 billion riyals ($4 billion) through an issue of bonus shares, it said on Wednesday.

One bonus share would be issued for each two shares held, increasing the number of the bank's outstanding shares to 1.5 billion from 1 billion. The capital increase, designed to aid growth of the bank's business, would be funded with 2.5 billion riyals from its retained earnings and 2.5 billion riyals from its statutory reserve.
