MILAN, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Investors in Sintonia have agreed to dissolve a shareholder pact controlling 45.6 percent of Atlantia <ATL.MI> by end-June, taking direct control of their stakes in the Italian motorway and airport operator, Atlantia said on Thursday.

After the move, which could make Atlantia more attractive to new investors, the Benetton family will own around 30 percent in the company. The statement confirms what Reuters reported earlier this month.
