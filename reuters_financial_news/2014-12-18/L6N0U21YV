CAIRO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was unchanged at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday and stronger on the unofficial market after the government established a fourth weekly dollar auction.

The bank offered $40 million and said it had sold $38.2 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBOE> to the dollar, a rate unchanged from its sales on Wednesday and Monday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. In the unofficial market, the pound was trading at about 7.78 to the dollar on Thursday, stronger than Wednesday's rate of 7.70 to the dollar.
