VIENNA, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling is concerned about the weak Russian rouble's impact on domestic tourism  rather than on banks exposed to the Russian market, he told a newspaper.

"It is of course not pleasant that the rouble drop will hit Austria as well - for instance, in tourism," he was quoted as saying by Der Standard in an in interview published on Thursday. Some Austrian ski resorts have complained a decline in bookings by Russian customers even before the latest decline in the Russian currency.

"It affects all the banks, no question, but I doubt at the moment that there is really a problem," he said. Raiffeisen and UniCredit both said this week their Russian businesses were holding up well despite the economic crisis in  Russia, where Western sanctions and falling oil prices have caused the rouble to plunge.
