NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities said on Thursday they had sued a former chief compliance officer of money-transfer firm MoneyGram International <MGI.O>, seeking to collect a $1 million civil penalty from him for failing to stop fraudulent telemarketers from using the firm's services.

The U.S. Departments of Justice and the Treasury said in a statement that under Thomas Haider, who left MoneyGram in 2008, the firm failed to put in place an effective anti-money laundering program and failed to file timely suspicious activity reports with law enforcement.
