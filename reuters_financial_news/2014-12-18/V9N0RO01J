VIENNA, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Austrian real estate company Immofinanz <IMFI.VI> expects rental income in Russia to fall around 10 percent in its 2014/15 fiscal year, it said on Thursday.

The Russia-focused property group had on Wednesday cast doubt over the payment of a dividend for its 2014/15 financial year, as it reported a second-quarter loss of 16.2 million ($20.1 million) euros. [ID:nL6N0U14MG]
