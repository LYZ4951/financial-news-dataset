JAKARTA, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Thursday as investor concerns about an earlier-than-expected rate hike eased after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would adopt a "patient" approach.

The U.S. Fed on Wednesday offered a strong signal that it was on track to raise interest rates sometime next year, altering a pledge to keep rates near zero for a "considerable time" in a show of confidence in the economy. [ID:nL1N0U12H4] Jakarta's Trimegah Securities said investors responded positively to the Fed's statement as they had anticipated a more aggressive stance following positive U.S. economic data. Concerns over a possible U.S. rate hike, combined with plummeting oil prices resulted in foreign outflows from emerging markets this week due to global risk aversion. The Thai index <.SETI> led the Southeast Asian rally with a 2.5 percent gain, boosted by energy stocks rebounding from losses posted earlier this week. Shares in Thai energy firm PTT PCL <PTT.BK> rose 6.3 percent. Its units PTT Exploration and Production PCL <PTTEP.BK> and PTT Global Chemical PCL <PTTGC.BK> were among those most traded in Bangkok. Philippine stocks <.PSI> rebounded from their losses and closed 0.9 percent higher. The index had lost 4.3 percent in the last two sessions. The Indonesian benchmark index <.JKSE> was up 1.5 percent, its highest one-day gain in two months, as the rupiah <IDR=> strengthened the most since October. Consumer and banking stocks were among the biggest gainers in Indonesia.
