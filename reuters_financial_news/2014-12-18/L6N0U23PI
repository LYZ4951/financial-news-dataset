LAGOS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria sold 53.50 billion naira ($289.97 million) worth of sovereign debt at an auction on Wednesday, where yields climbed more than 200 basis points across the board on paper with maturities ranging between 3-year and 20-year.

The Debt Management Office (DMO) said it sold 7.5 billion naira in the 3-year debt note at 15.49 percent, compared with 12 percent at the previous month's auction. The debt office had initially offered 10 billion naira of the 3-year bond. It sold 18 billion naira worth of 10-year paper at 15.2 percent, against 12.8 percent at the previous auction, while a total of 28 billion naira of the 20-year note was sold at 15.49 percent, compared with 13 percent last month. The debt office sold less that the initially advertised amount of the 10-year note, but more of the 20-year bond -- it DMO had initially offered to sell 30 billion of the 10-year bond and 25 billion naira in the 20-year.
