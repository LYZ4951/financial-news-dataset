NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Dec 17 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $12.5 billion to $1.074 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $12.9 billion to $1.007 trillion.
