MEXICO CITY, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Grupo Financiero Inbursa <GFINBURO.MX>, the bank unit owned by billionaire Carlos Slim, on Thursday said it agreed to buy the bank division of Wal-Mart de Mexico <WALMEXV.MX>.

Inbursa said it will pay 1.7 times Walmex bank's capital at the moment the deal closes. That would value the deal at about 3.6 billion Mexican pesos ($246.94 million), based on its current capital. The supermarket chain's bank unit is focused on credit cards and lending for Walmex customers.
