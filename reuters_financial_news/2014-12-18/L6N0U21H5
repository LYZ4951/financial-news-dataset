LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Britain's pound <GBP=D4> <EURGBP=D4> gained around 0.5 percent against the dollar and the euro on Thursday, helped by much higher than expected retail sales numbers for November, a boost for an economy that had looked to be cooling off.

Sterling hit a day's high of $1.5664 after the numbers showed sales rose 1.6 percent on the month compared to forecasts of 0.3 percent, adding to some hopeful signs around Christmas consumer spending.
