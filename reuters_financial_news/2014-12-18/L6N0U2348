LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - British mutual insurance group LV= [LV.UL] said on Thursday it had agreed to take over the majority of rival company Teachers Assurance's business interests.

LV= manages 10.3 billion pounds ($16 billion) in assets, while Teachers Assurance manages around 1 billion pounds, LV= said in a statement. The company declined to give a figure for the size of the acquisition. Teachers Assurance's unit trust business will transfer to Threadneedle Investments, LV= added. Shock British pension reform has dented sales at life insurers this year, seen as a key factor behind Aviva <AV.L>'s recent $8.8 billion deal to buy Friends Life <FLG.L>. [ID:nL6N0TM0TM]
