LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Greece's top share index turned higher on Thursday after the leader of the main opposition parted said he was committed to keeping Greece in the euro should his leftist party take power next year.

Athens Composite index <.ATG> erased earlier losses to trade 1.4 percent higher after Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras told Reuters that he wanted a negotiated debt relief solution with the European Union, and wanted to keep the country in the currency bloc. Greek markets have been knocked by the prospect of a general election if parliament fails to vote on a new president by the end of the year, with the prospect of a Syriza victory in a popular vote raising questions over the country's continued membership of the European Union.
