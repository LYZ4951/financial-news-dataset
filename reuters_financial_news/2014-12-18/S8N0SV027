LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Britain's finance ministry said on Thursday it had recovered a further 1.36 billion pounds ($2.13 billion) that it had to pay out to British depositors when Icelandic bank Landsbanki went bust in October 2008.

Britain's depositor guarantee scheme paid 4.5 billion pounds to savers who had put money into high-interest accounts operated by Icesave, Landsbanki's British branch. The ministry said it had now recovered 85 percent of the money owed by Landsbanki's estate, and expected to receive the full amount by 2017.
