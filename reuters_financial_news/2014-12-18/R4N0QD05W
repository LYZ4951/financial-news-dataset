MOSCOW, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the government had to take additional measures to forge economic stability.

"There have been results but the government must take other measures," he told his annual end-of-the-year news conference, adding that the central bank was not the only body responsible for the economic situation.
