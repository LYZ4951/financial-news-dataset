SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares posted their biggest gain in a year on Thursday, as an upbeat economic assessment from the Federal Reserve triggered a relief-rally in global markets unnerved by  financial turmoil in Russia and tumbling oil prices.

Overnight, the Fed gave a confident assessment on the economy and promised to be patient in removing policy stimulus. [ID:nL1N0U12H4] A sharp bounce in oil prices off multi-year lows also provided relief for Australia's battered energy sector. [ID:nL3N0U11ZX] "The rally was inspired by the FOMC statement last night," said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress, referring to the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee. "The other factor is the (upward) pressure in the oil market and commodities that will feed through the performance of the Aussie stock market." The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> surged 1.6 percent or 83.44 points to 5245.3 by 0120 GMT, its biggest one-day rally since Dec. 19, 2013, and closing on its highest intraday level in a week. QBE Insurance Group <QBE.AX>, which has significant business in the U.S., led the financial sector higher, rallying 4.8 percent. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> and National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> each rose 1.6 percent.  Among large miners, BHP Billiton <BHP.AX> rose 2.7 percent and Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> added 2.9 percent, while gold major Newcrest Mining <NCM.AX> surged 4 percent and iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group <FMG.AX> surged 6.4 percent. Energy stocks followed oil's bounce: Woodside Petroleum <WPL.AX> added 2.6 percent and Santos rallied 6.3 percent. Elsewhere, fund manager Challenger Ltd <CGF.AX> bounced 7.4 percent after it said it resolved a long-running court action. Travel agent Flight Centre <FLT.AX> plummeted 9 percent after issuing a profit downgrade and travel insurer Cover-More <CVO.AX> fell 7 percent because of concerns about domestic travel growth. [ID:nL3N0U204V] New Zealand's benchmark NZX50 index <.NZ50> rose 23.1 points or 0.4 percent to 5,519.73 in early trade, tracking gains in Asian markets and hovering near a record closing high of 5,542.93. Gains were limited as investors were cautious amid the recent global market volatility. Pacific Edge <PEB.NZ> jumped 3.7 percent to NZ$0.85, recovering from a three-week low of NZ$0.820 after the cancer testing company reported a surge in half-year revenues as it expands further into the U.S. market.
