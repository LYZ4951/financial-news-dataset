JAKARTA, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets mostly rose on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve eased concerns regarding an earlier-than-expected rate hike.

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday offered a strong signal that it was on track to raise interest rates sometime next year, altering a pledge to keep rates near zero for a "considerable time" in a show of confidence in the economy.[ID:nL1N0U12H4]. "It receives positive response from investors," Jakarta broker Trimegah Securities said in a note on Thursday, adding investors had anticipated a more aggressive statement from the Fed after the US posted positive economic data in recent weeks. The Indonesian benchmark stock index <.JKSE> posted its biggest gain in five weeks at 1.1 percent. The biggest gainers in Jakarta included heavyweight PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk <TLKM.JK>. Shares in the country's largest telecommunications company rose 2.6 percent, after falling in the previous four sessions. The Thai index <.SETI> rose 1.8 percent as energy stocks continued to recover from losses made earlier this week. PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK>, a unit of energy giant PTT PLC <PTT.BK>, rose 6.4 percent after having slumped to its lowest closing since 2008 on Tuesday.
