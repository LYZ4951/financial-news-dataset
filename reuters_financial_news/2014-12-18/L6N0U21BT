LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The average cost of a comprehensive UK car insurance policy rose 0.3 percent in November to 590 pounds ($921), the third successive month of rises, a Towers Watson survey said on Thursday.

Overall, price rises over the past three months were 2.1 percent, Towers Watson said in a statement. This follows around three years of falls totalling 32.5 percent, Towers Watson added. Analysts say British motor insurers such as Admiral <ADML.L> and Direct Line <DLGD.L> have been operating in a highly competitive market, contributing to price pressures.
