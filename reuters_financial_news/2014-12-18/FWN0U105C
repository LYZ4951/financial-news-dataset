ZURICH, Dec 18 (Reuters) - UBS <UBSN.VX> said on Thursday that it has no plans to levy negative interest rates on its retail clients and has already imposed fees on interbank clients in the past two years to discourage Swiss franc holdings.

"We have been observing the development of market interest rates and cash-deposits of certain clients, especially balances on current-accounts and cash-clearing accounts in interbank transactions for quite some time," the Swiss bank said in a statement after Switzerland's central bank disclosed negative interest rates earlier on Thursday. [ID:nL6N0U20MS] "As a consequence, we've already levied fees to discourage interbank clients from holding excessive cash balances over the past two years."
