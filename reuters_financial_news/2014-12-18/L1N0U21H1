NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday it will offer $27 billion in two-year government debt for sale next Monday, which is the smallest auction size for this maturity since February 2008.

The upcoming two-year Treasuries note supply was 39 percent below the peak size of $44 billion set in 2010.   The two-year note offering <US2YTWI=TWEB> is part of the combined $91 billion in fixed-rate coupon securities the Treasury planned to auction next week. [ID:nW1N0SW014]
