LJUBLJANA, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Slovenia's second-largest bank Nova KBM (NKBM), which is due to be privatised in the first quarter of next year, on Thursday forecast that it would make a net profit in 2015 of 28.2 million euros ($34.71 million).

The bank had to be rescued by the state last year when Slovenia narrowly avoided an international bailout. The government had to pour more than 3 billion euros into local banks to prevent their collapse under a mass of bad loans. NKBM did not provide a forecast for its full-year 2014 profit but said it would end this year with a positive result. In May, the bank had predicted a small loss for the year. Slovenia hopes to sell NKBM by the end of the first quarter of 2015 and has received several bids. [ID:nL6N0S433I] Hungarian bank OTP <OTPB.BU> has submitted the highest bid for NKBM, worth 150 million euros, according to local media reports. OTP and Slovenian authorities declined to comment on the reports. In November, NKBM reported a profit of 26.4 million euros for the first nine months of 2014, which compared to a loss of 66.9 million for the same period a year earlier. [ID:nL6N0TI3PA] In 2013, NKBM made a loss of 648.4 million euros. The bank narrowly failed the European Central Bank stress tests in October. This showed that it would have a capital shortfall of 31 million euros at the end of 2016 under an adverse economic scenario. It said it would cover the shortfall from this year's profits. [ID:nL5N0SL0K8] NKBM said its balance sheet assets were expected to fall to 4.3 billion euros by the end of 2015 versus 4.46 billion at the end of September 2014.
