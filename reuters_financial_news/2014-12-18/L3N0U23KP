MUMBAI, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose 1.6 percent on Thursday to snap a five-session losing streak as blue-chips including ICICI Bank surged as a rally in global markets and the cabinet's nod to a nationwide sales tax bill led to unwinding of short positions.

Asian share markets rose on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it would wait until at least two meetings before raising rates. [MKTS/GLOB] Investors were also encouraged after the Indian cabinet approved a constitutional amendment bill on Wednesday to rationalise state and central indirect taxes into a harmonised goods and services tax (GST). [ID:nL3N0U14SB] The developments sparked a recovery in domestic shares that had been hit by concerns about financial contagion from the Russian currency's drop to record lows. [ID:nL6N0U10LX] "Progress on GST is positive and recent correction is a good opportunity for investors to increase their India allocations," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.
