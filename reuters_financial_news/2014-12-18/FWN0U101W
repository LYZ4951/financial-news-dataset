ZURICH, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank on Thursday said it would introduce a negative exchange rate of -0.25 percent on sight deposit account balances at the central bank as it seeks to deter safe-haven buying.

In recent weeks, the franc has edged closer to its 1.20 per euro ceiling as the euro weakens on expectations the European Central Bank will launch full-blown quantitative easing early next year.
