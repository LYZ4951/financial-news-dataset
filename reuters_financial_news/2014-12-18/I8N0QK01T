MUMBAI, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose over 1.5 percent on Thursday to snap their five-day selling streak as blue-chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> surged after a global rally and the cabinet's nod to a nationwide sales tax bill led to unwinding of short positions.

ICICI Bank provisionally rose 4.4 percent, while Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> ended higher 2.7 percent.
