Dec 18 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Paulson & Co has taken a stake in specialty pharmaceuticals company Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd <SLXP.O> as the company recovers from inventory issues and the departure of its chief financial officer, according to people familiar with the matter.

The size of Paulson's stake was not immediately clear, the people said.  Separately, some top shareholders said they are pushing for the Raleigh, North Carolina-based Salix to consider a sale. It is not clear if Paulson is part of that group.  The fund has recently taken a number of large positions in healthcare companies including Shire PLC <SHP.L>, where it is the number one holder, according to Thomson Reuters data.
