SHANGHAI, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China's benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement rate rose over 4 percent for the first time since July on a weighted average basis, showing increasing pressure on liquidity as the year winds down.

The move comes after the central bank abstained from open market operations on Thursday, neither injecting nor draining funds for the week. [CN/MMT]
