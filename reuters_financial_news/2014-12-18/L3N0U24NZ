LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Former Ferrari chairman Luca Di Montezemolo is returning to the board of Formula One as a non-executive director along with former Diageo chief executive Paul Walsh, controlling shareholders CVC said on Thursday.

Bernie Ecclestone has also rejoined the board, after standing down during a now-resolved bribery trial in Germany, and will continue as chief executive. Di Montezemolo, whose appointment is effective from Jan. 1, was a non-executive director as Ferrari's representative from 1991 to 2014 but he left the Italian sportscar company in October after a major restructuring. CVC said Nestle chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, who has been unwell, will continue to serve as chairman of the board.
