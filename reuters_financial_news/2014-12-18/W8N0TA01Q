WARSAW, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Polish central bank's head Marek Belka supported failed motions for interest rate cuts of 25 and 50 basis points (bps) at the November meeting of the bank's rate-setting council, voting records published by the bank showed on Thursday.

The motions were supported by other doveish members of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Council: Andrzej Bratkowski, Jerzy Osiatynski and Anna Zielinska-Glebocka, the records showed. Both motions failed as the council decided to keep rates on hold.
