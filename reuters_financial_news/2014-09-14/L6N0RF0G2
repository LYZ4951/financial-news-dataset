BENGHAZI, Libya, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Libya's elected parliament on Sunday dismissed the central bank governor of the oil producing country, a parliamentary spokesman said.

The bank governor Saddek Omar Elkaber had failed to attend a session at the House of Representatives to discuss alleged financial irregularities at the central bank, the spokesman for the House said.
