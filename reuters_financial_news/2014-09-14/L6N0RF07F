LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - British newspapers reported the following business stories on Sunday. Reuters has not independently verified these media reports and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE SUNDAY TIMES  YES VOTE TO SPARK PENSION CRISIS AT RBS Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> could face a giant funding gap of up to 5.6 billion pounds ($9.11 billion) in its pension scheme if the country votes to become an independent nation this week.  Many of Britain's biggest companies, including BP <BP.L> and Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L>, would also be affected, with a black hole of about 100 billion pounds opening up in the UK's corporate retirement plans, according to analysis by the investment bank Credit Suisse. The funding gap could emerge because pension schemes with members in both Scotland and the rest of the UK could be deemed "cross border" after a "yes" vote. Under EU rules, these schemes must be "fully funded" at all times.  PHONES 4U JOBS AT RISK AS CREDITORS CLOSE IN The future of more than 6,000 Phones 4u workers has been thrown into doubt after the heavily indebted high street chain prepared for talks with its creditors.

MICK THE MINER BUILDS UP WAR CHEST Mick Davis, the former boss of Xstrata, has strengthened his fundraising team as he seeks to top up a $4 billion war chest amassed to launch a mining giant.
