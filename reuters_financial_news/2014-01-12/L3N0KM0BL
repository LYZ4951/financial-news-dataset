The benchmark slipped 0.2 percent on Friday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> edged up 0.1 percent to 4,867.9 in early trade. * The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended modestly higher on Friday, led by gains in defensive names after a weaker-than-expected payrolls report raised new questions about both the strength of the economy and the aggressiveness of Federal Reserve stimulus. * Data on Friday showed U.S. employers hired the fewest workers in nearly three years, although unusually cold weather may have had an impact.* Copper rose on Friday, lifted by a weaker dollar after worse-than-expected U.S. labour market data reinforced the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to be cautious in scaling back its bond-buying stimulus programme. * Australia will release the housing finance data for November at 0030 GMT, with the December job advertisements figure from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group also due at the same time.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2206 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1842.37  0.23% 4.240 USD/JPY <JPY=>   104.04  -0.08%-0.080 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.8579  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1248.33  0.00% 0.000 US CRUDE<CLc1>   92.861.31% 1.200 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16437.05-0.05% -7.71 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  147.52   0.99%  1.45 ------------------------------------------------------------- * S&P ends up, led by defensive stocks; earnings in play [.N]   * Oil rises $1 as shorts cover on U.K. oilfield glitch  [O/R]   * Gold rises 1.5 pct after weak payrolls, posts weekly gain[GOL/]   * Copper rises as dollar pressured by weak U.S. jobs data [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB]   (Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471  4234) DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
