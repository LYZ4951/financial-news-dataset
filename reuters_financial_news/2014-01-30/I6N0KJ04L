MILAN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Tod's <TOD.MI> fell more than 5 pct on Thursday after the Italian luxury shoemaker posted full-year sales that missed analyst estimates.

The group said after Wednesday's market close that revenue totalled 979.2 million euros ($1.34 billion) in 2013, compared with a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate of around 985 million euros, hit by weak sales in its main market of Italy and a change in strategy at its wholesale division.

Investment banks UBS <UBSN.VX>, JP Morgan <JPM.N> and Barclays <BARC.L> cut their price targets for the stock. Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> raised its target price, with a "sell" rating.
