LAGOS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Yields on Nigeria's government debt rose 12 basis points across all maturities in midday trading on Thursday as foreign investors sold down their holdings, dealers said.

There has been a broad emerging market sell-off this week as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues tapering its bond buying programme, which had kept global markets awash with cash. Yields on 5-year <NG5YT=RR>, 7-year <NG7YT=RR> and 10-year <NG10YT=RR> bonds, all listed on JP Morgan's emerging market government bond index, rose in volatile trade, dealers said.
