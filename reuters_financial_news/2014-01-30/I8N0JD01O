MUMBAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - India's central bank will prevent extreme volatility in the rupee, its chief Raghuram Rajan told Bloomberg TV on Thursday.

"What I am intent on is to prevent extreme volatility of the rupee, though I am not averse to adjustments," Rajan said in an interview to Bloomberg TV. The Indian rupee weakened on Thursday amid a global rout after the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to further prune its asset purchase programme.
