STOCKHOLM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British engineering group Renishaw <RSW.L>, a smaller competitor to Sweden's Hexagon <HEXAb.ST>, posted higher sales and profits in the second quarter on Thursday and said it saw improved trading in the remaining part of its fiscal year.

Renishaw, a competitor to Hexagon in the metrology segment, is also a player in the rapidly growing industrial 3D printing industry, called additive manufacturing. The company said it had seen strong demand for its additive manufacturing products in the period. Renishaw said group sales in the first half of the year grew 12 percent in the Americas while growth in Europe stood at 11 percent. In the Far East, sales fell 25 percent due to very high comparables in the year-ago period. "Whilst the Group faced tough financial comparators for the first half of this financial year and (the) sterling has strengthened in recent months, we are expecting an improvement in trading activities and revenue in the second half," Renishaw said in a statement.
