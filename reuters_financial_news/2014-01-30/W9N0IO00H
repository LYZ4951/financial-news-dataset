WELLINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is set to start rate rises at its March monetary policy statement, according to a Reuters poll of analysts on Thursday.

The RBNZ will lift the official cash rate (OCR) by 25 basis points from a record low 2.5 percent, where it has been for nearly three years, making it the first central bank among developed economies to raise rates. Earlier on Thursday, the RBNZ held the OCR steady, as expected, but said it would start moving rates back to more normal levels "soon". [ID:nL5N0L2052] "A rise in March is a near certainty - barring an external shock or a marked and sudden deterioration in New Zealand's prospects," said ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley. All 15 economists polled pick an OCR rise in March, with a steady tightening programme through the year, taking the benchmark rate to 3.50 percent after the December statement. Financial market pricing based on interest rate swaps, had put a one in three chance of a rate rise at the latest review, but sees a 96 percent chance of a March rise, with 122 basis points of rises over the next 12 months. <CSSY> "The risks are a slightly faster and/or bigger tightening cycle," said Tuffley, who said a more elevated NZ dollar would also dampen inflation. "All other things equal, that greater degree of inflation restraint would mean interest rates won't need to do as much work as otherwise."  This is a Reuters poll of economists' expectations for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) monetary policy statement. ---------------------------------------------------------------  RBNZ monetary policy statement, March 13, 9 am (2000 GMT) NEXT MOVE  MARCH RISK (%)   JUNE  SEPT  DEC  MARCH  bps +25  N/C  -25ANZ(March +25)  9550   3.25  3.25  3.50  3.75  ASB(March +25)  80   200   3.00  3.00  3.25  3.50  BNZ(March +25)  9550   3.25  3.50  3.75  4.00  Citi   (March +25)   N/A   2.75  3.25  3.75  N/A   Deutsche   (March +25)  9640   3.00  3.25  3.50  3.75  First NZ   (March +25)  85   150   3.00  3.25  3.50  3.75  Goldman(March +25)  90   100   3.25  3.25  3.25  3.50  HSBC   (March +25)  80   200   3.25  3.25  3.50  N/AInfometrics(March +25) 10000   3.25  3.75  4.00  4.25  IFR Markets(March +25)  9082   3.00  3.25  3.50  3.75  JP Morgan  (March +25)  80   901   3.00  3.25  3.25  3.50  RBC(March +25)  85   141   3.00  3.00  3.25  3.50  TD Secs(March +25)  9550   3.00  3.25  3.50  3.75  UBS(March +25)  9550   3.25  3.75  4.00  4.25  Westpac(March +25)  9082   3.25  3.50  3.75  4.00
