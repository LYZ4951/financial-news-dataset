MADRID, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Santander <SAN.MC>, the euro zone's biggest bank, expects earnings at its UK business to rise 17 percent in 2014, Chairman Emilio Botin said on Thursday, following a 3.1 percent rise in profits there in 2013.

The UK arm posted profit of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) in 2013. Botin sees profit at its Spanish division reaching 1 billion euros in 2014 before tripling to 3 billion euros in 2016, he said. Speaking to reporters, Botin also said it would take part as a banking adviser in the government's potential sale of its stake in nationalised lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>.
