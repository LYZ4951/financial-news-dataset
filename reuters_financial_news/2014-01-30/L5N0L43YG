LISBON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Portugal's third-largest listed bank BPI <BBPI.LS> posted on Thursday a steeper-than-expected 73 percent fall in 2013 net profit, pressured by the high cost of state loans and a drop of 18 percent in net interest income.

Net profit fell to 66.8 million euros ($90.6 million), while analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected, on average, a net profit of 79 million euros. BPI's net interest income -- the difference between interest charged on loans and interest paid on clients' deposits -- fell to 475 million euros.
