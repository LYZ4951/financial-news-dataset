LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Shares in HSBC <HSBA.L> briefly spiked as much as 10 percent on Thursday, before reversing most of those gains in a move which traders blamed on human error, know in the market as a 'fat finger'.

HSBC shares rose as high as 688 pence before retreating to 631 pence. The move in the heavyweight bank also prompted a spike in Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, which briefly turned positive on the day.
