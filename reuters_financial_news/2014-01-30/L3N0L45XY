The benchmark fell 0.8 percent on Thursday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.6 percent in early trade. * The S&P 500 scored its biggest gain in more than a month on Thursday as Facebook led a tech rally and data showed the U.S. economy was on solid footing in the fourth quarter of last year. * Copper prices fell to a near two-month low, dragged down by a strong dollar and lacklustre demand from China ahead of a week-long holiday, while overproduction in aluminium pressured the metal to its lowest level in nearly five years. Gold fell 2 percent. * Spot iron ore prices fell to the lowest in more than six months amid thin buying interest from Chinese steel mills adequately stocked on the raw material ahead of a week-long Lunar New Year holiday.  * Australia's quarterly producer inflation data and private sector credit are both due at 0030 GMT.----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2212 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1794.19  1.13%19.990 USD/JPY <JPY=>   102.7   0% 0.000 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.6931  -- 0.018 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1242.79 -0.03%-0.410 US CRUDE<CLc1>   98.070.73% 0.710 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   15848.61 0.70%109.82 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  140.79   0.28%  0.39 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St Rebounds with tech gains, signs of growth   [.N]   * U.S. crude oil rises on strong GDP data[O/R]   * Gold drops 2 pct on equity rally, stronger U.S. dollar[GOL/]   * Copper falls to near 2-mnth low on weak Chinese demand[MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB]   (Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471  4234) DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
