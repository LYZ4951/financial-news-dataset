Jan 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Germany-based  pharmaceuticals wholesaler Phoenix Pharmahandel GmbH & Co. KG's [PHNMD.UL] (Phoenix)  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'BB'. It  has also affirmed the EUR506m bond due 2014 issued by Phoenix PIB Finance BV and  the EUR300m bond due 2020 issued by Phoenix PIB Dutch Finance BV at aBBa. The  Outlook is Stable. The affirmation reflects Phoenixas resilient credit metrics despite an intense  competitive environment, its ability to gain back market share in its core  market and the companyas commitment to a prudent financial policy. Fitch expects  Phoenixas free cash flow (FCF) to remain positive and net leverage to remain  consistent with its ratings, in spite of margin pressure. Fitch projects that  net adjusted (lease and ABS/factoring) debt/EBITDAR will in FY14 increase to the  threshold for negative rating trigger, from 3.74x in FY13, before falling back  to 3.5x in FY16.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Sector Pressures, Bottoming Out Phoenix, like all of its sector peers, operates with fairly low profitability  compared with pharmaceuticals producers (in FY13 Phoenixas EBITDAR margin was  3.2%). In 2013 the German wholesale market (where Phoenix generates around 31%  of revenue) faced intense price pressure due to price wars. As a result Fitch  projects EBITDAR margin will decline by 50bps to 2.7% in FY14. We believe that  the price war in Germany is unsustainable given the low margins in the sector  and therefore do not expect to see any further significant decline in Phoenixas  profitability.   Recovering Market Share In FY14 Phoenix was able to win back the market share that it previously lost to  competitors at the expense of EBITDAR margins. For the next two years, we  project that the companyas market share in Germany will remain stable. We do  not, however, expect any material improvement in profitability despite the  implementation of cost-saving initiatives. This is because the company will be  focused on retaining its current market share amid challenging competition,  particularly in light of the announced merger between Celesio and US-based  McKesson <MCK.N> (A-/RWN). Deleveraging Slows in FY14  Overall net adjusted (lease and ABS/factoring) debt /EBITDAR decreased to 3.7x  in FY13 from 4.3x in FY11. Fitch expects this ratio to deteriorate to slightly  above 4x in FY14 due to an estimated 18% drop in EBITDAR, before falling to 3.5x  in FY16. The reduction in leverage will be driven by expected positive free cash  flow and further declines in net debt.  Phoenix Forward Programme The Phoenix Forward Programme will support EBITDAR margins over the next three  years. Phoenix estimates that the programme will provide sustainable savings of  at least EUR100m till FY16. The programme focuses on improving efficiencies,  including bundling of administrative functions to increase operational focus and  refinement of warehouse efficiency which we believe is a sensible approach.  However, Fitch expects some of these cost savings to be reinvested to maintain  competitive pricing.   Wholesale Pharmaceuticals Leader Phoenix is one of the largest European players in the pharmaceuticals wholesale  market. The rating reflects its geographical diversification, which helps  strengthen its market position with pharmaceutical manufacturers and makes it  fairly resilient to healthcare policy changes in single countries.   Integrated Business Model Phoenixas leading position in the European wholesale market is complemented by  retail and supplier service activities. Phoenix owns pharmacies in most  countries it operates in and where multiple pharmacy ownership is possible such  as the UK. Integrating supplier services and retail activities has enabled  Phoenix to achieve synergies and to fully capture the available margin between  pharmaceutical manufacturers and end-customers.  We expect retail margins to  remain stable for the next four years.  Resilient Positive Free Cash Flow Despite the expected reduction in profitability in FY14 Fitch expects continuing  positive free cash flow (FCF), although it may be tempered in the near term due  to investments in working capital to support sales growth initiatives. Fitch  expects EBITDAR to FCF conversion to average 30% by January 2017. Although this  is lower than the average 54% over the past three years, it should translate  into annual positive FCF of EUR150m which is comfortable in relation to its  future debt maturities.  Pressure for Pharmacy Acquisitions; No Dividends  As its competitors are acquiring pharmacies, Phoenix could be at risk of losing  customers, particularly if pharmacy markets in Europe liberalise. Therefore our  forecasts assume some annual acquisition spending on retail pharmacies, but only  with a small budget of EUR20m, reflecting managementas commitment to limited M&A  activity. The adverse credit impact arising from acquisitions is balanced by  Phoenixas commitment to maintain a conservative financial policy with no plans  for dividends.  Average Recoveries for Bondholders Fitch rates Phoenixas bonds at the same level as the IDR, reflecting limited  subordination from the groupas prior-ranking on-balance sheet ABS and factoring  lines and Italian credit lines that together represented EUR473m at end-FY13.   Prior-ranking debt/EBITDA was at 0.8x in FY13 and is expected by Fitch to remain  below 1.5x in FY14. This is well below the 2x threshold that Fitch typically  applies under its generic recovery approach to assess subordination issues for  unsecured bondholders who are protected by guarantees from material subsidiaries  representing at least 75% of the groupas consolidated revenues and EBITDA.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to the positive rating action  include: -Stabilisation in operating performance and conservative financial policy  driving net (lease, factoring and ABS) adjusted debt / EBITDAR to below 3x  (FY13: 3.7x). This would be equivalent to FFO adjusted net leverage below 3.5x  (FY13: 3.7x)  -Operating EBITDAR net fixed charge cover above 3.5x (FY13: 2.9x) on a sustained  basis. This would be equivalent to FFO fixed charge coverage above 3x (FY13:  2.7x) -FCF/EBITDAR sustainably above 40% (FY13: 47%) -Slowing competitive pressure in Phoenixas major markets   Negative: Future developments that could lead to a negative rating action  include: -Net (lease, factoring and ABS) adjusted debt / EBITDAR above 4x (equivalent to  FFO adjusted net leverage above 4.5x)  -Operating EBITDAR net fixed charge cover below 3x on a sustained basis  (equivalent to FFO fixed charge coverage below 2.2x) -FCF/EBITDAR falling below 25% on a sustained basis  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE
