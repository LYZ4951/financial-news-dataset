WARSAW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Polish lender Bank Zachodni WBK <BZW.WA> wants its 2014 consolidated net profit to exceed last year's 2.015 billion zlotys ($652 million), the bank's Chief Executive Mateusz Morawiecki said on Thursday.

"We want to improve this result (2013 income) thanks to lower costs and a rise in revenue," Morawiecki told Reuters in an interview.
