BELGRADE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund will ask Serbia to make additional savings of 400 million euros ($550 million) to secure a precautionary loan deal with the lender, the country's deputy prime minister said on Thursday.

The IMF and Serbia are scheduled to start talks on a new loan deal on Feb. 26, three weeks before early elections set for March 16.  A new agreement is crucial for assuring investors anxious about the size of Serbia's budget deficit, one of the biggest in the region.  It could also further boost SNS's election hopes, with the party already way ahead in polls over the Socialists of  outgoing Prime Minister Ivica Dacic. The Fund froze its previous 1 billion euro arrangement with Belgrade in 2012 due to the government's failure to cap spending and the public debt. "The key condition for the precautionary deal with the IMF will be for us to find ways to save 400 million euros," Aleksandar Vucic, the deputy prime minister and the head of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), the biggest in the outgoing coalition, told a news conference.  Vucic did not specify the time frame for the savings to be made. The IMF has already told Serbia, which started accession talks with the European Union this month, to reform its bloated public sector and trim deficit and debt.

Earlier this week, Daehaeng Kim, the Fund's representative for Serbia, said elections have been taken into consideration in scheduling the loan deal talks.
