LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Great Recession is in danger of turning into the Great Unwinding.

Turkey's aggressive attempt to stop its lira tumbling and South Africa's less-fevered defence of the rand have both failed to stop the rot. And they are by no means the only emerging markets seeing capital run away faster than a scalded cat. The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to pull more stimulus from the global system hasn't helped - and neither has news of China's manufacturing slumping. The danger is not just to emerging markets, of course. Cheap liras, rands and roubles hit developed economies in three ways:  1) they import deflation 2) they make local goods uncompetitive and 3) they dry up demand for exports. So for barely growing economies like some of those in the euro zone, a meltdown in major trading partners is a shared problem. With this in mind a Turkish-Italian business conference in Rome featuring Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan may prove more interesting that these things usually do. Italy, in the meantime, has problems of its own, not the least being trying to get its famously indecisive election system reformed so that it can actually get something done on a governmental level. A bill that would favour strong coalitions or parties - e.g. by setting higher minimum thresholds for entry into parliament - goes to that very parliament today. It has broad support, though some analysts have already said they fear a new system that will make it harder, not easier, to create sustainable coalitions. Rome also auctions 8.5 billion euros of medium- to long-term bonds, a test of how global risk aversion may be playing in the euro zone periphery. Top data drop of the day in Europe will be German inflation, which feeds directly into later euro zone numbers and from there into the European Central Bank's deliberations about whether inflation is dropping too far below its close-to-but-below 2 percent target. The ECB has already acted with one rate cut based at least in part on falling inflation. Reuters polling suggests that year-on-year harmonised inflation (what the ECB looks at) may tick up a tad to 1.3 percent, which would keep the ECB calm. But month-on-month, prices are expected to have fallen (deflation) in December. So any unexpected dip that drags down the yearly figure will probably pull down euro zone yields and hit the euro.
