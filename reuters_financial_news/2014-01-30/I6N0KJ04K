MILAN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Pirelli <PECI.MI> dropped 6 percent in early trade on Thursday, underperforming a marginally lower Milan stock market, after the Italian tyre maker denied having received any offer from potential buyers.

On Wednesday FT Alphaville cited informed sources as saying the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Pirelli CEO Marco Tronchetti Provera were looking to unpick Pirelli's complex ownership structure with a view to taking the company private. The stock gained 7.2 percent in the session. The report said Goldman had previously made an offer to buy Pirelli, backed by Russian oil group Rosneft <ROSN.MM>, but that approach had fallen through. "(The report) is pure fantasy. Whoever circulated it is responsible to the market and the authorities," Tronchetti Provera said in a statement. [ID:nI6N0KJ04J]
