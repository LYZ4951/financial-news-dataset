WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Capital flows to emerging markets should gradually recover in 2015 as global growth quickens after what is expected to be a slight fall this year, a global financial industry group forecast on Thursday.

But recent market turbulence shows that some countries will fare better than others in attracting foreign investment, the Institute of International Finance, or IIF, said in a report. Worries about China's economic slowdown and the wind-down in the U.S. Federal Reserve's massive monetary stimulus - combined with political turmoil and economic vulnerabilities in some countries - have led to a selloff from emerging markets in recent days. The IIF, an association that counts some of the world's largest banks among its members, said the recent market turbulence shows investors are likely to become more sensitive to risks as the global supply of easy money dries up. An expected slowdown in emerging economies, compared with growth rates around 7.5 percent before 2008, should also affect investment in the future. [ID:nL5N0L33I9] The IIF predicted that net inflows into emerging markets will total $1.13 trillion this year, below the $1.14 trillion level expected for 2013 (The institute is expected to tally actual 2013 inflows this spring.) That is partly due to a drop-off in inflows at the end of last year and the beginning of this one, the report said. But net inflows should recover gradually up to $1.18 trillion in 2015, above the institute's October forecast and close to historical highs hit in 2007. The report tracks flows to 30 large emerging market countries. However, the level of capital inflows as a share of countries' national income has fallen since 2010, and the overall figures mask significant differences, the IIF said. "The markets of countries that suffer the most are those with clear macro imbalances, dependent on external financing, compounded by political problems or uncertainty," Hung Tran, the institute's executive managing director, told reporters on a conference call. Recent developments in Argentina, Turkey and Ukraine are perfect examples, because all three countries are struggling with political uncertainty combined with deteriorating external finances, the IIF said. Turkey's lira <TRYTOM=D3> fell to a record low before the Turkish central bank increased all its main interest rates and pledged to tighten liquidity further if necessary. The IIF said there were risks of another wide selloff in emerging markets in the future, as investors shift focus from the slowing of the Fed's monthly bond purchases to the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates after 2015.
