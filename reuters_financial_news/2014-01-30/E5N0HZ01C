SAO PAULO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Loan defaults at Banco Bradesco SA <BBDC4.SA><BBD.N>, Brazil's No. 2 private-sector lender, should remain stable or fall slightly this year, Chief Financial Officer Luiz Carlos Angelotti said on Thursday.

Bradesco beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates on the back of a prudent stance on credit, interest rates hikes in the second half of last year and efforts to limit loan-loss provisions. Recurring net income, or profit excluding one-time items, came to 3.2 billion reais ($1.3 billion), up 9.6 percent on a year-on-year basis, a filing said.
