PARIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - European stocks fell early on Thursday, losing ground for the fifth time in six sessions, after the U.S. Federal Reserve further trimmed its stimulus and as a measure of Chinese manufacturing slipped to a six-month low.

At 0909 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top  European shares was down 0.3 percent at 1,287 points. The index is down 4.6 percent in six sessions, as mounting concerns over a number of emerging economies prompted investors to shun risky assets such as equities. Roche <ROG.VX> was the biggest drag on the index, down 1.7 percent after the Swiss drugmaker posted lower-than-expected profits and raised its dividend less than expected. [ID:nL5N0L40D6]
