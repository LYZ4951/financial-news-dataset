MUMBAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - India's NSE bank index <.NSEBANK> fell as much as 2 percent to its lowest since October, heading towards a sixth consecutive losing session, as part of a rout in emerging markets.

Banks have been among the worst hit this week after the Reserve Bank of India unexpectedly raised interest rates. Falls were led by ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS>, which lost 2 percent, and HDFC Bank Ltd <HDBK.NS>, which was down 1.6 percent.
