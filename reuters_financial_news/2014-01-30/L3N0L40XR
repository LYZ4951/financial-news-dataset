TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Shares of Japanese biotech firms soared on Thursday, bucking sharp losses in the overall market, after scientists found a simple way to reprogramme mature animal cells back into an embryonic-like state that allows them to generate many types of tissue.

Japan Tissue Engineering Co Ltd <7774.T>, which specialises in regenerative medical techniques, rose 7.5 percent to 444,000 yen. Takara Bio Inc <4974.T> rose as much as 10 percent at one point before paring gains to last trade 2.4 percent higher at 2,160 yen. "Retail investors are the main buyers," said a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm. "Rallies in biotech stocks tend to be short-lived as their valuations are high, but even long-term investors like us own some of these stocks." The research, led by a Japanese researcher, has been described as game-changing by experts in the field, as it suggests human cells could in future be reprogrammed by the same technique, offering a simpler way to replace damaged cells or grow new organs for sick and injured people.
