Jan 30 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares neared a five-month low, after Thursday's underwhelming private survey of China factory activity further reduced risk-appetites following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to again trim its monetary stimulus.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended half-day trade down 0.5 percent at 22,035.4 points, paring early losses that took it to the lowest point since Aug. 30. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong sank 0.8 percent. In January, the two indexes tumbled 5.5 and 9.2 percent, respectively.
