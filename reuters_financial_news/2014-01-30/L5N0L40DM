WARSAW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Poland's economic growth should rise to around 3 percent in 2014, above the 2.5 percent target envisaged in the budget, Finance Minister Mateusz Szczurek said on Thursday.

The former communist country has posted nearly two decades of uninterrupted growth but its economy slowed sharply last year and growth fell to near zero in the first quarter of 2013. It has been gathering pace since then.
