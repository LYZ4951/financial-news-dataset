Jan 30 (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Chubb Corp <CB.N> reported a more than five-fold rise in quarterly profit as the company paid lower claims.

The company's net income rose to $569 million, or $2.24 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $102 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. [ID:nPnbJ7KSt] Profit in the year-earlier quarter was heavily affected by Super storm Sandy, which battered the U.S. east coast in October 2012.
