ISTANBUL, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Turkey's largest food group Yildiz Holding has signed a deal to sell its yeast-making unit Dosu Maya to French company Le Saffre for $220 million, Yildiz Chairman Murat Ulker said.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday in embargoed comments, Ulker also said the group is in talks with a foreign fund to sell its 11 percent stake in Islamic bank Turkiye Finans. Yildiz revenues last year rose 17-18 percent, exceeding expectations for a rise of 13-14 percent, Ulker also said. Yildiz, which owns family-run biscuit company Ulker <ULKER.IS> and premium chocolate maker Godiva, is seeking to focus on developing its consumer brands. The group generated sales of 12.4 billion lira ($5.48 billion) in 2012. Yildiz last year bought Spanish discount retailer Dia's <DIDA.MC> Turkish operation DiaSA for 136.5 million euros ($186 million). [ID:nL5N0D62H5]
