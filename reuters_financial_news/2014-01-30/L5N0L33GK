LUXEMBOURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - An adviser to Europe's top court rejected on Thursday an appeal by MasterCard <MA.N> against a European Union ban on its cross-border card fees.

"I propose that the court should dismiss the main appeal and the cross appeals," Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi said in his opinion. Judges at the Luxembourg-based European Union Court of Justice, who follow the advisers' recommendations in the majority of cases, will rule in the coming months.
