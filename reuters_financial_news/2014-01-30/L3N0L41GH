Jan 30 (Reuters) - The following corporate finance-related stories were reported by media:

* Google <GOOG.O> is close to settling a three-year European antitrust probe with "much better" concessions to allay concerns over blocking rivals such as Microsoft <MSFT.O> from internet search results, two sources said on Wednesday. [ID:nL5N0L321]  * Greece's biggest lender National Bank <NBGr.AT> plans to shed its private equity business to boost its capital, three banking sources told Reuters. [ID:nL5N0L344N]  * State Bank of India <SBI.NS> raised $1.2 billion through a share sale, sources with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters, falling short of its $1.5 billion target and clouding the outlook for equity offerings by other banks in a slowing economy. [ID:nL3N0L3440]  * Cable group Altice [ATICEA.UL] has narrowed the price range for its planned stock market debut to around the middle of the original range, two sources close to the deal told Reuters. [ID:nL5N0L33IU]  * Russian hypermarket chain Lenta may proceed with a planned London share listing as early as next week, sources said, that could value the retailer at $5 billion and deliver a big return for its backers including U.S. private equity firm TPG [TPG.UL]. [ID:nL5N0L31Q5]  * Indian billionaire Ajay Piramal's plan to buy 20 percent stake in Shriram Capital, the holding company for the group's financial services businesses, has hit a hurdle as stakeholders and the buyer are yet to agree on the quantum of stake that the Mumbai-based firm could own, the Economic Times reported, citing two people familiar with the development.
