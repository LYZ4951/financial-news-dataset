DUBAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Oman's Bank Dhofar <BDOF.OM> has proposed a dividend for 2013 of 14 percent cash and 11 percent bonus shares, the lender said in a statement on Thursday.

This is equivalent to 0.014 rials ($0.04) per share of cash and one free share for every nine a shareholder owns. This compared to a 15 percent cash dividend plus bonus shares of 10 percent that was given out in 2012.
