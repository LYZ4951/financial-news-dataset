DUBAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's largest lender, National Commercial Bank [NCMBK.UL], has picked four banks to arrange a local currency sukuk that will boost its capital, a document from lead managers said on Thursday.

NCB had mandated itself as well as the investment banking arm of Gulf International Bank and the Saudi Arabian units of HSBC <HSBA.L> and JP Morgan <JPM.N> to arrange the transaction. The sukuk will enhance the bank's Tier 2 - or supplementary - capital and will have a ten-year lifespan with an option of the bank redeeming the instrument after five years. The size of the issue has yet to be determined.
