TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc <8604.T> beat analyst estimates by reporting a 2.4-fold on-year rise in third-quarter net profit, with earnings boosted by a surge in stock trading by individual investors and sales of mutual funds.

Japan's largest investment bank has been cashing in on retail investors' renewed interest in stocks as prices are spurred higher by government pro-growth policies. In a statement on Thursday, the bank said net profit reached 48.3 billion yen ($472.37 million) in October-December from 20.1 billion yen a year earlier. That compared with the 41.2 billion yen mean estimate of  three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
