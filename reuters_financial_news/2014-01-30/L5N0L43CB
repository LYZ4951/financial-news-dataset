DUESSELDORF, Germany, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Strauss Innovation, a German chain of small department stores, said on Thursday it was seeking protection from creditors to try and rescue its business which has 96 shops across the country.

Strauss, owned by U.S. private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, has suffered from a mild winter hurting sales of cold weather clothing, industry sources said.  Earlier this week, German department store Karstadt said its sales fell 3 percent in the key Christmas period, while rival Kaufhof <MEOG.DE> said the mild winter weather had dampened sales of clothes.

In Germany, online sales rose 54.5 percent over the Christmas period from the same time the year before. Across the continent, online transactions rose 37 percent in December.
