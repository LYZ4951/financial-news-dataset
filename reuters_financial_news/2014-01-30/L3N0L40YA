HONG KONG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Higher quotas, fewer regulatory restrictions and clearer tax guidelines are needed to give foreign investors greater access to China's markets through a pilot investment scheme.

Despite worries about China's shadow banking sector and a slowing economy, the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) scheme, which allows overseas funds to buy onshore assets in yuan, has made huge strides in recent months thanks to buoyant demand from investors looking for chunky yields and a stable currency. The first yuan exchange-traded fund (ETF) under the RQFII scheme was listed in London in January while a Chinese government bond ETF and the second yuan ETF listed in the United States. under RQFII is expected to launch shortly. [ID:nL3N0L22ZG][ID:nL3N0KJ35S] The RQFII scheme, launched in 2011, allows financial institutions to use offshore RMB to invest in the Chinese mainland securities markets, including stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Regulatory restrictions are also being eased. RQFII applications in Singapore and London are likely to quicken. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the market regulator, sent a notice last week to custodian banks, confirming that license application and investment operations in those two places would be the same as in Hong Kong, a source told Reuters.  The simple procedures to obtain licenses bode well for a strong pipeline of diversified RQFII products available to investors beyond Hong Kong, boosting the use of the renminbi in global trade.  But relatively small quotas and a pending withholding tax issue means global funds investing in China will find it a slog for now.  "RQFII quotas are still too small for institutional investors who won't bother to allocate assets in China unless $100-200 million can be distributed to them," said Ding Chen, chief executive officer at CSOP Asset Management, the largest RQFII products provider with total quotas of around 34.1 billion yuan ($5.63 billion). At present, most of the quotas granted to an RQFII product by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) are no more than 2 billion yuan ($330.53 million) and thus the share each institutional investor finally gets is even lesser. In Ding's view, all global investors have so far held an underweight position on China, because Chinese stock indices have not been adopted in international benchmarks, but also due to lack of channels and quotas to invest into China. Taxes are another headache. The current regulations have not specifically stated if RQFII and its older cousin the Qualified Foreign Institutional  Investor (QFII) programme are subject to taxes in China or if they are totally exempted.  As a result, fund managers have to make withholding tax provisions, though the Chinese government has never collected it, making any products marketed under these schemes costly. The uncertainty on the tax front has in some degrees dampened interests from international investors and affected sales of related products, prompting Chinese money managers to seek ways to dodge this issue. For example, China Asset Management (Hong Kong) said this week it would no longer make withholding tax provisions for its CSI 300 Index ETF <83188.HK><3188.HK> from Jan. 27, making it the first Hong Kong listed RQFII ETF that can do so. The company said the changes could be made because the fund obtained a Hong Kong Tax Resident Certificate and thus was able to enjoy certain withholding tax exemption on capital gains under the China-HK Arrangements. More RQFII product providers are expected to go down this route to protect their market share and offer cheaper options to investors seeking exposure to China.  Quotas are also being dished out at a faster pace. As of Jan. 27, a total of 167.8 billion yuan of quotas had been approved for 57 RQFII licences under a total 270 billion yuan quota granted to Hong Kong.  WEEK IN REVIEW: * China money manager CSOP Asset Management said it had won  approval to launch the first Chinese government bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) under the RQFII scheme. The fund will be listed and traded in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early February. * J.P. Morgan Asset Management said on Tuesday it has received a 1 billion yuan investment quota under the RQFII scheme and it aimed to launch an actively managed equity fund investing in China's stock market. * Outstanding yuan loans in Hong Kong amounted to 109.7 billion yuan at end-November 2013, up some 40 percent from the end of 2012, according to statistics from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. * HSBC Bank (China) announced on Monday the opening of its Shanghai Free Trade Zone sub-branch, focusing initially on servicing corporate customers with cross-border financial needs in the pilot zone. * European Central Bank governing council member Jens Weidmann said on Monday China's yuan <CNY=CFXS> did not qualify yet as a reserve currency. Convertibility of the currency was the crucial point and that was not the case at the moment, he added.
