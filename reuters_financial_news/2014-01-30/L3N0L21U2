JAKARTA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Indonesia's economy likely grew at its slowest pace in nearly 4-1/2 years in the final quarter of 2013 as policymakers aggressively raised interest rates to defend the rupiah and cut the ballooning current-account deficit, a Reuters poll showed.

The median projection of economists was for annual growth of 5.30 percent <IDGDP=ECI> in the fourth quarter, after 5.62 percent growth in the prior quarter. For the full year of 2013, gross domestic product in Southeast Asia's largest economy likely rose 5.70 percent, the slowest since 2009. The country has traditionally posted annual growth of more than 6 percent, underpinned by robust domestic consumption and strong investment. Compared with the previous three months, GDP likely fell 1.67 percent in the fourth quarter, the largest such contraction since the fourth quarter of 2009, the poll also showed. GDP typically falls in October-December on a quarter-on-quarter basis as domestic consumption slows following a spike in demand for religious festivities and the new academic year.
