JOHANNESBURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Nigerian naira and Kenyan shilling could weaken in the coming week as foreign investors trim exposure to major African debt and equity markets amid a flight to safety from emerging markets.

Ghana's cedi is expected to hold steady as central bank support improves liquidity. NIGERIAThe naira <NGN=D1> is expected to depreciate further in the coming days, weighed down by offshore investors exiting Nigeria's debt and equity markets following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to push ahead with reducing its bond-buying stimulus. Traders said many foreign investors have been selling their debt holdings in Nigeria and repatriating the proceeds back to their countries, putting pressure on the local currency. At 1057 GMT, the naira was trading around 163.17 to the dollar, compared with its 160.28 close a week ago. It weakened to a near four-month low of 163.95 on Monday. [ID:nL5N0L11EH]  On Tuesday, Kingsley Moghalu, a deputy governor of Nigeria's central bank, told Reuters the withdrawal of U.S. stimulus had removed some potentially destabilising "hot money" flows to Nigeria, but monetary policy needed to stay tight to keep the naira stable. [ID:nL5N0L1389] The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would reduce its monthly bond-buying programme by a further $10 billion a month. The Fed's stimulus has benefited emerging economies and frontier markets like Nigeria where bond and Treasury bill yields are higher than those in the developed world. "Demand for dollars has risen since the Fed announced its decision to go ahead with tapering, with some offshore investors selling down their debt and equity positions," one dealer said. Traders said dollar sales by energy companies could ease the pressure on the local currency in the coming week.  KENYA Kenya's shilling <KES=> is likely to weaken in the coming week as foreign investors take profits and exit Kenya's stock market.The Kenyan stock exchange's main index closed lower for the third session in a row on Wednesday, while the shilling has eased by about 0.3 percent against the dollar since the start of the week."The (shilling) will continue weakening as the stock market continues to shed points," said Joshua Anene, a trader at Commercial Bank of Africa.Traders say the shilling is likely to come under pressure if the rout in emerging market currencies, sparked by the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering its economic stimulus, spills over to frontier markets. The foreign capital flight has seen stocks decline and local currencies weaken in emerging markets and traders say it is only a matter of time before frontier market currencies start to weaken as foreign investors look for safe haven assets. "We think the worst is yet to come for us," added Anene, in reference to the Kenyan shilling.  TANZANIA Tanzania's shilling <TZS=> is expected to gain ground against the dollar in the coming days due to a slowdown in importers' demand for hard currency. Commercial banks in Dar es Salaam quoted the shilling at 1,620/1,630 on Thursday, weaker than 1,618/1,628 a week ago. "The outlook for next week is that the shilling might appreciate against the dollar due to a slowdown in (dollar) demand," said Hakim Sheikh, a trader at Commercial Bank of Africa, Tanzania. "The shilling has been stable over the past two days, with support from the central bank." Market participants said they expect the shilling to trade in the 1,610-1,620 range next week.  UGANDA Uganda's shilling <UGX=> is forecast to be rangebound in the days ahead as the market anticipates the central bank will leave rates unchanged next week, underpinning the shilling. At 0947 GMT commercial banks quoted the currency of the east African economy at 2,470/2,475, marginally stronger than last Thursday's close of 2,475/2,480. January inflation is likely to drop further although the central bank is seen leaving its key rate unchanged, potentially offering the local currency additional support. "Poor appetite for dollars will keep the shilling well supported in the coming day ... I see it playing in the 2,465-2,485 range," said Faisal Bukenya, head of market making at Barclays Bank. "My expectation is that the central bank will hold the (policy) rate to try to consolidate the gains on the inflation front." A rate hold, Bukenya said, would underpin a stable shilling. The currency has strengthened 2.1 percent this month, helped by soft demand for dollars from corporate firms. The Bank of Uganda is expected to announce its benchmark Central Bank Rate (CBR) for February early next week after the release of January consumer inflation data by the statistics office on Friday. GHANA The cedi <GHS=> could stabilise against the dollar next week as the central bank resumes interbank dollar sales to improve liquidity, traders said. The cedi has weakened by 4 percent versus the dollar so far this year on unmet corporate dollar demand.  It was trading at  2.4600-2.4650 to the dollar at midday on Thursday, in line with Wednesday's close.  "The local unit has been relatively stable during the week as market liquidity improves," Yaw Adu-Koranteng of the Accra-based NDK financial services group said.  Another trader said a robust and consistent injection of dollars would be required to restore liquidity in the interbank market, which has been inactive for eight months. Bank of Ghana officials said a total of $20 million had been released into the interbank market this week. The central bank is currently holding a strategic meeting outside the capital, Accra, after which it is expected to announce further measures to stem the slide of the cedi, which fell nearly 20 percent last year.ZAMBIA
