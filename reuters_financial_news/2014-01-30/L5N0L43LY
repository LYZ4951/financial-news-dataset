OSLO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The head of Norway's stock market association called for a national ratings agency to help investors better understand the risks of the fast-growing Norwegian bond market.

"There is a need for a Norwegian rating agency which could have a better understanding of the Norwegian market," head of the association and leader of corporate finance at Norsk Hydro Peik Norenberg said at an industry conference on Thursday. A national ratings agency could bolster the market's confidence in domestic bonds and help smaller companies raise debt more easily, he said.
