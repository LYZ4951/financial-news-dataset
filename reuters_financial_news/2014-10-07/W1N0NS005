WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's purchases of asset-backed securities could help address the problem of weak lending to small and medium-sized firms in the euro zone, the IMF's chief economist said.

"We think that...a good, healthy (asset-backed securities) market would be useful," Olivier Blanchard said at a press conference on Tuesday. "This is a market in which spreads are still sometimes quite large, so we think the ECB can indeed help by developing that (market)."
