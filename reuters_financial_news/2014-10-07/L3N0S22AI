HANOI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VN Index <.VNI> ended almost flat on Tuesday with mixed moves of stocks near the market's resistance level, while funds snapped up property firms on expectation of a recovery in the long-troubled real estate sector.

The index closed down 0.06 percent at 614.08 points with the market retreating towards the end of the session after the 615-point resistance level was passed in early trade. Investors focused on property stocks, hedging on the long-term bounce of a sector stymied for several years by bad debt and weak credit growth. The central bank has vowed measures to tackle both problems. Kinh Bac City Development <KBC.HM> led the property firms, surging 5.42 percent to close at its highest since April 2012, Reuters data showed. Other real estate firms also advanced. Tan Tao Investment and Industry <ITA.HM> rose 1.08 percent and Binh Duong Trade and Development <TDC.HM> advanced 3.74 percent. "The real estate market can't get any worse," said analyst Hoang Huy of ACB Securities. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT). VN Index   614.08   PREV.
