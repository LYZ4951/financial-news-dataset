SAO PAULO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The backlog for Brazilian initial public and follow-on offerings remains robust at the moment, but sales will only resume next year as companies remain wary of market and political unucertainty, a group representing investment banks said on Tuesday.

A number of offerings expected for this year may have to wait until next year, when the outlook for the economy turns clearer, said Carolina Lacerda, a director for the capital markets chapter at Anbima, as the group is known.
