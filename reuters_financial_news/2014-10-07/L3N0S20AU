SYDNEY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Australian shares ended a volatile session 0.2 percent lower on Tuesday, clawing back gains in late afternoon trade as the materials sector underpinned the broader index, though shares were still hovering at February lows. [ID:nL3N0S205S]

The materials sector gained 1.4 percent to offset earlier steep losses, with Rio Tinto leading with a 4.3 percent jump to two-week highs of A$60.07. Rio said on Tuesday it rejected a merger approach from smaller rival Glencore Plc <GLEN.L> in August to create a $160 billion mining and trading giant. [ID:nL3N0S205S] The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> slipped 8.7 points to 5,284.2 at the close of trade. The benchmark fell 0.5 percent on Monday. Elsewhere, Australia's central bank kept interest rates at record lows for a 13th straight policy meeting, saying the economy was to run a little below par for some quarters to come.
