ABU DHABI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co <HPQ.N> has sold its 40 percent stake in United Arab Emirates-based Injazat Data Systems for an undisclosed amount to its investment partner, Abu Dhabi state-owned fund Mubadala [MUDEV.UL].

The deal, announced in a statement from Injazat on Tuesday, comes a day after HP said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations. [ID:nL3N0S127C]
