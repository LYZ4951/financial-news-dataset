BANGKOK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets edged lower after a range-bound session on Tuesday, with the Thai index ending at a near two-month low amid losses in large caps but Indonesia bucked the trend, rising for a second day amid technical-led buying.

Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> finished down 0.2 percent at 1,539.39, its lowest close since Aug. 8, extending Monday's 1.7 percent drop. Among those actively traded, shares of airport operator Airports of Thailand <AOT.BK> fell almost 1 percent to the lowest level since Aug. 21 after weak tourism related data. The number of tourists arriving in Thailand in September dropped a preliminary 7.0 percent from a year earlier after a fall of 11.9 percent in August, showing the country's big industry continues to feel the pinch of a long political crisis. [ID:nL3N0S20QH] Stock exchange data showed inflows into Indonesian large caps such as Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> and Astra International <ASII.JK> helped bring Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> 0.7 percent higher. "The decline last week was quite steep. Investors are returning since some of the blue chip stocks are trading at relatively cheaper prices," said Jakarta-based Muhamad Alfatih, an analyst with Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia. Others in the region appeared to be tracking Asian markets.
