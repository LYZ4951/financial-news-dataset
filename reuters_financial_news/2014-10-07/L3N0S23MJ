Oct 7 (Reuters) - Punch Taverns Plc <PUB.L> said it had received approval from Royal Bank of Scotland Plc <RBS.L> for its plan to restructure its 2.3 billion pound ($3.70 billion) debt, allowing the restructuring to proceed.

The pub operator said in August that owners of 65 percent of its notes supported the plan, but that it had yet to secure the backing of lenders. [ID:nRSG6622Ta]
