NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N>, said on Tuesday that the businesses of big U.S. banks were not as good as they were a few years ago, and that U.S. home-building would pick up.

"What was a very profitable business has been turned into a good business if executed well," Buffett said on the largest U.S. banks at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel, California.
