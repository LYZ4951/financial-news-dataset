WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer credit increased less than expected in August and growth for the prior month was revised lower, giving a cautious signal about the pace of economic expansion.

Total consumer credit rose $13.5 billion to $3.25 trillion in August, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. The figure for July was revised down to show a gain of $21.6 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to increase $20 billion in August. The weak reading could bolster the view that economic growth downshifted in the third quarter from the torrid pace of expansion clocked in the prior three months. Most economists see the economy expanding at around a 3 percent annual rate in the July-September period, which would be slower than in the second quarter but faster than average growth over the last few years.
