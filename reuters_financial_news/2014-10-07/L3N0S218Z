Oct 7 (Reuters) - Duncan Niederauer, former chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, has joined startup brokerage Battery East as a managing director.

Niederauer will help facilitate capital raises and "bring his established rolodex of institutional investors to Battery East's pre-IPO clientele," San Francisco-based Battery East said in a statement. [ID:nBwbbnW05a] Battery East, which began operations last month, is an institutional-based financial services firm that specialises in providing private stock transactions. Niederauer, who served as the CEO of NYSE since 2007, stepped down in May - six months ahead of his scheduled retirement, due to the rapid integration of IntercontinentalExchange Group and NYSE. [ID:nL3N0O83WC] The firm provides founders, employees, venture investors and companies access to long-term capital from renowned institutional investors. "I see the pre-IPO market as the next frontier, and I'm excited to be joining a firm dedicated to bringing transparency and an institutional approach to this growing market," the statement quoted Niederauer as saying.
