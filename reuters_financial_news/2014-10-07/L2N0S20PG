SAO PAULO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Grupo Oi SA <OIBR4.SA>, the debt-laden Brazilian telephone and wireless carrier, has yet to make a decision over the sale of its assets in Portugal, for which it has not received a bid.

Rio de Janeiro-based Oi, which earlier this year combined its assets with those of Portugal Telecom SGPS SA <PTC.LS>, is determined to continue with a strategy to dispose of non-core assets like Africatel Holdings BV, according to a securities filing on Tuesday. The company is still looking for potential buyers for its African unit and has so far not received a bid.
