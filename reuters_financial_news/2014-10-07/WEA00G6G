STOCKHOLM, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Swedish Bankers' Association is recommending all its members to introduce tougher amortisation guidelines, the organisation said on Tuesday.

The association recommended that borrowers pay down the principal on all new loans over 50 percent of the market value of the property. "We think that 50 percent is a good level to reach a healthy amortisation culture in Sweden," association chairman Thomas Torsos said in a statement.
