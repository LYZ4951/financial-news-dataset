JERUSALEM, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's Maalot raised its ratings for three of Israel's largest banks on Tuesday, citing an assessment that the economic risk profile for the banking sector has declined in recent years.

The Israeli unit of S&P raised its rating for Israel's two biggest banks - Hapoalim <POLI.TA> and Leumi <LUMI.TA> - to "AAA-" from "AA+" and First International Bank of Israel (FIBI) <FTIN.TA>, the country's fifth-largest lender, to "AA+" from "AA-".
