LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Telecom operator Swisscom <SCMN.VX> is reviewing the sale of its Italian broadband firm Fastweb, which is worth up to 5 billion euros (6.28 billion US dollar), sources familiar with the situation said.

The Swiss majority state-owned firm, which has already rebuffed several takeover approaches from Vodafone <VOD.L> for Fastweb, is now working with UBS <UBSN.VX>, Vodafone's long-term adviser, to facilitate a deal, said the sources who could not be named because the matter is private.
