MUNICH, Oct 7 (Reuters) - German property group LEG Immobilien <LEGn.DE> is looking to buy apartments outside its home region North Rhine-Westphalia as is seeks to expand following a stock market listing last year, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

"If portfolios in (the German states of) Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse or Lower Saxony come up for sale we would not rule out having a look at them," Thomas Hegel told Reuters on the sidelines of Munich property fair Expo Real.  LEG usually seeks to buy 5,000 apartments annually but has set a target of 10,000 for this year because there are more suitable properties on the market. The Duesseldorf-based group still has a war chest of roughly 600 million euros ($755 million), which should suffice for the 2014 goal, Hegel said. "For anything larger we would need capital measures such as a cap hike. But that would depend on costs of capital and the pipeline (of acquisition targets)," he said.  Despite analyst reports mentioning LEG as a potential takeover target for rivals like Deutsche Annington <ANNGn.DE> Hegel does not expect to fall prey to a larger peer.
