LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Woodford Investment Management, the fund firm run by one of Britain's most high-profile fund managers, Neil Woodford, said on Tuesday it had sold its Reckitt Benckiser <RB.L> shares on valuation grounds.

The fund had 1.5 percent of its 2.7 billion pounds ($4.34 billion) in assets in Reckitt stock at the end of August. Woodford, who left Invesco Perpetual earlier this year to set up his own company, had been a shareholder in the company for over a decade, the money manager said in a blog post. "We continue to view Reckitts as a great business with a very strong management team and an excellent product line-up," it said.
