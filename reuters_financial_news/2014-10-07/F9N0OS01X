FRANKFURT, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's commitment to using additional unconventional tools to support the economy if needed is not a promise to fire its remaining policy weapons right away, Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said.

The ECB launched a fresh stimulus package worth billions of euros in June and September, but has stressed it is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate if inflation remains too low for too long.
