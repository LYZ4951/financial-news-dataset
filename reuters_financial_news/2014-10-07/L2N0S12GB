NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The trustee of Hubbell Inc's <HUBb.N> <HUBa.N> controlling family trusts is evaluating alternatives for their holdings, which may lead to a shakeup at the $7.2 billion U.S. electrical equipment maker, according to people familiar with the matter.

The trustee, which oversees family trusts that control a significant portion of Hubbell's voting power, has tapped Credit Suisse Group <CSGN.VX> to review options for the shares, the people said this week. They asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Shelton, Connecticut-based Hubbell has a dual class structure, under which its Class A shares control 73 percent of the voting power. With almost half of the Class A shares owned by the Harvey Hubbell and Louie E. Roche trusts, the family holdings are seen as key to the company's fate. The trustee's review, which is in its early stages, covers a range of options, including a sale of the shares, and follows pressure from another large shareholder in Hubbell, two of the people said. It is not clear if any move to divest the holdings would trigger a sale of the entire company.
