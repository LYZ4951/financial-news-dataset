NEW DELHI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S.-based economist Arvind Subramanian is unlikely to become India's chief economic adviser after the prime minister questioned a request to appoint him, a source said on Tuesday, a further delay to filling a position key to writing the budget.

A senior official at the finance ministry said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would soon send a new list of names to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a final decision would be taken by the two men. The official declined to be identified.
