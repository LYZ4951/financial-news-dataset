BELGRADE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Serbian central bank sold euros on the interbank currency market on Tuesday in support of the dinar, weakened by shallow  trade and delays in the adoption of a revised budget and the start of IMF loan talks, dealers said.

The bank intervened as the dinar traded at 119.6, a 0.24 percent drop on Monday's close.
