July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its global rating criteria for corporate collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The report replaces the Global Rating Criteria for Corporate CDOs", dated 8 August 2013. The agency does not expect any rating changes from the implementation of this criteria update.  The updates include (i) application of concentration stresses in the  surveillance analysis, (ii) minor changes to the industry sector mapping (iii) a  description of 'CCC' bucket modelling for cash flow analysis of  overcollateralisation tests in CLOs, and (iv) a description of the application  of the Criteria for Sovereign Risk in Developed Markets for Structured Finance  and Covered Bonds.  Fitch has revised the surveillance approach for Corporate CDOs by applying   concentration stresses in the surveillance analysis of existing CDOs as well as  in the analysis of new CDOs. The concentration stress includes a correlation and  recovery stress to the five largest risk contributors in the portfolio.  Nevertheless, rating committees may choose not to apply model-implied rating  actions where the transaction portfolio is not expected to see a sustained  change in performance and where there is, as a result, an expectation that there  could be a short term reversal of such a rating action. Any such departures from  model-implied results would typically not exceed a rating category.   While Fitch does not expect the application of concentration stresses to  existing ratings to have any rating impact it may result in the deferral of any  future upgrades for first generation European CLOs that have started to  deleverage.  As part of the changes in the industry and sector mapping the industry 'textiles  and furniture' was remapped to the retail, leisure and consumer sector and  'business services' was created as a standalone sector to address the diverse  nature of the industry group. The changed mapping will result in slightly lower  correlation in portfolios with a significant share of assets in the business  services sector. This will have a marginally positive impact on default rates,  particularly for higher ratings. However, testing showed that for typical  portfolios there will be no rating impact.  The updated criteria provide a more detailed description of the 'CCC' bucket  modelling approach as part of Fitch's cash flow analysis of European CLOs. The  first generation of CLOs have shown that the efficiency of par value tests can  be greatly improved by incorporating haircuts to the value of 'CCC' and  lower-rated assets. Historical data show that more than 80% of rated corporates  that defaulted had ratings that were  in the 'CCC' category or lower prior to  default.  The CLO-specific application of the Criteria for Sovereign Risk in Developed  Markets for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds and its effect had already been  published in a commentary 'No Immediate Rating Impact on European CLOs From SF &  CVB Sovereign Criteria' dated 19 May 2014.
