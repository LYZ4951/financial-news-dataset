SOFIA, July 25 (Reuters) - These are some of the main stories in Bulgarian newspapers on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

-- Boiko Borisov, the leader of the opposition GERB party, returned the mandate for forming a new Bulgarian government to President Rosen Plevneliev, who will now give the mandate to the second largest group in parliament - the Bulgarian Socialist Party (Capital daily, Presa, Standart, Trud, 24 Chasa, Sega). -- Outgoing Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski said he was not sorry that he became a prime minister, adding it turned out to be "a little harder than expected". Oresharski said he is firmly behind his nomination of Kristalina Georgieva for EU foreign policy chief (Capital daily, Trud, Presa, Standart). -- The ethnic Turkish MRF party also said it is behind Georgieva's nomination (Trud, Standart, Sega). -- Bulgaria belongs to the group of countries characterized by high human development, United Nations Development Programme's annual report showed. The Balkan state was ranked 58th among 187 countries in the list. -- Sofia Municipality discharged Stoyan Tsvetanov, the head of Toplofikatsiya heating utility's branch in the capital. He has been criticized for having deposited 90 percent of Toplofikatsiya Sofia's funds, which amount to 80 million levs ($55.11 million), at troubled Corpbank without a proper decision from the Board of Directors (Trud, Standart).
