July 24 (Reuters) - Moody's Investor Service raised Portugal's government bond rating on Friday to "Ba1" from "Ba2", citing the expectation that the country's fiscal consolidation remains on track.

Portugal's highest court in May struck down several budget measures, including some public sector salary cuts, creating a fiscal gap of about 700 million euros this year. [ID:nL5N0OT450] "The first driver behind the upgrade is Moody's view of the government's strong commitment to fiscal consolidation, despite repeated set-backs stemming from the adverse rulings of the country's Constitutional Court," Moody's said on Friday.
