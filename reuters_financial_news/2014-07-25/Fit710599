July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed TDA 30, FTA's class A (ISIN ES0377844008) notes at 'A+sf' and revised the Outlook to Stable from Negative. The Spanish prime RMBS transaction comprises loans originated and serviced by  Banca March [BNCMH.UL] (not rated).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Arrears Performance The rating actions reflect the solid performance of the underlying assets over  the past year. As of the latest reporting period, three-month plus arrears  (excluding defaults) were at 0.7% of the current pool balance, while cumulative  gross defaults (defined as loans in arrears for more than 12 months) were at  3.2% of the initial portfolio balance. Both these figures are below Fitch's  Spanish RMBS index for three-month plus arrears (2.1%) and cumulative gross  defaults (4.6%).  Fitch notes that 5.3% of loans have had their maturity extended. Data received  from the management company, Titulizacion de Activos SGFT, suggests that 99.3%  of the borrowers that have had their maturity extended are performing. For this  reason, in its analysis of the transaction, Fitch did not apply any additional  default probability adjustments on this segment of the portfolio. Defaulted Loans Fully Provisioned The transaction's structure allows for the full provisioning of defaulted loans.  To date, annualised gross excess spread of 0.5% of the outstanding collateral  balance, has enabled the issuer to clear defaults without making any significant  draws on the reserve fund. The reserve fund level is currently at 94% of its  target amount.  The affirmation also reflects Fitch's expectation that the reserve fund will  replenish in the upcoming months as the pipeline of future defaults continues to  decline.  Payment Interruption Risk The transaction could be exposed to payment interruption risk in the event of  default of the servicer, Banca March. To mitigate this risk, a dedicated  commingling reserve was funded in October 2011, which is currently EUR0.5m. The  issuer can draw funds from this reserve for both commingled amounts and  liquidity shortfalls. Our analysis shows that the liquidity provided by the  reserve fund (EUR7.7m) reduced by the expected loss, and the commingling  reserve, is sufficient to cover three months' worth of stressed senior interest,  net swap payments and senior expenses in the event of a servicer disruption.
