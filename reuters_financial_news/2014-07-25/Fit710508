July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Rolta Americas LLC's USD300m 8.875% senior unsecured notes due 2019 a final rating of 'BB-'.  The final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information  already received, and is in line with the expected rating assigned on 15 July  2014. Rolta Americas LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rolta India Limited <ROLT.NS> (Rolta; BB-/Stable), a company with interests in information technology (IT) and  geospatial services.  The notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Rolta, and are  therefore rated at the same level as Rolta's foreign-currency senior unsecured  rating of 'BB-'. The company will use about 75% of the proceeds of the notes to  refinance its existing secured debt and the balance for general corporate  purposes. The notes rank pari passu with the issuer's existing and future senior  unsecured indebtedness. Rolta has changed its financial year-end from June 30 to  March 31. The ratings factor in its financial results for the nine months ended  March 2014 and our expectations for future performance. USD300m bond's terms and conditions are similar to Rolta LLC's USD200m 10.75%  guaranteed senior notes due 2018, except that in the USD300m notes the interest  reserve account is not required, the fixed charge coverage ratio is lowered to  2.5x from 3.0x, and Rolta's guarantee on the notes is reduced to 1.5x the bond  issuance amount from 2.0x.  These changes provide weaker comfort for bondholders in a stressed scenario.  However, in light of the company's current profitability levels, ability to  generate positive free cash flow (FCF), and rating level of 'BB-', these changes  do not affect the ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Ratings Headroom: Rolta's funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted leverage  of 3.7x at end-March 2014 (FY13: 4.1x) is close to the 4.0x threshold above  which Fitch may consider a negative rating action. We expect its leverage to  remain stable at around 3.5x during FY15-16 as a decline in capex/revenue to  12%-13% (9MFY14: 29%) would offset a likely deterioration in operating EBITDAR  margin to 33%-35% (FY14: 37.3%) resulting in FCF margin of 5%-6% (9MFY14: -9%). Likely Lower Profitability: Rolta is gradually shifting its business from a  high-margin but capital-intensive model to a lower-margin, lower-capex model.  Fitch expects annual capex to decrease to around INR3.5bn-4bn during FY15-16 in  line with the company's plan to generate new products, the development costs of  which would be expensed rather than capitalised. Management expects annual capex  to fall to INR2bn during the same period. Rolta invested about INR45bn, or 56%  of its revenue, during FY11-14 mostly to acquire intellectual property,  intangible assets and to develop demonstrations and prototypes.  Changing Revenue Mix: Operating EBITDAR margin is also likely to fall due to a  change in the product mix with a higher revenue contribution from Rolta's IT  services business, which contributed 72% of FY14 revenue (FY09: 55%) and  typically generates relatively lower operating EBITDAR margin of 28%-30%. The  geospatial segment, which generates margins of 50%-55%, contributed 28% of FY14  revenue. Reasonable Barriers to Entry: Rolta's 'BB-' ratings benefit from its  niche-market strategy, established market position in engineering and geospatial  services and innovative product portfolio in IT services, which are reasonably  differentiated from traditional IT companies. Rolta's geospatial segment has  high entry barriers with limited competition in geospatial services including 3D  mapping, surveying and image processing to various federal and local  governments, utilities, telcos, and infrastructure and defence agencies. Improved Debt Structure: At end-July 2014, total debt of USD670m consists of  USD200m 10.75% notes at Rolta LLC and USD300m 8.875% notes at Rolta Americas  LLC. Rolta's bonds are subordinated to secured debt of around USD170m or 25% of  total debt which is mainly commercial loans from Indian banks to operating  companies. Fitch does not notch the unsecured notes one level down from the IDR  given reasonable recovery on unsecured debt, growing cash generation and  management's strategy to replace secured debt with unsecured debt. Positive FCF starting FY15: Fitch expects Rolta to start generating positive FCF  of INR1.5bn-2bn or 5%-6% of its revenue during FY15-16 as operating cash  generation should be stable and capex lower. During FY15, Fitch forecasts that  Rolta will generate about INR10bn of EBITDA, which would be sufficient to cover  its interest and tax of INR3bn-4bn and a similar amount on capex. Rolta is  likely to remain with its dividend policy of distributing 20% of its net income.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include - FFO-adjusted leverage at above 4.0x. However, Fitch expects the company to  maintain leverage below 4.0x during FY15-18, driven by a decrease in capex and  stable FFO growth.
