July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned the State of  Bremen's EUR250m floating-rate bond (DE000A11QJY9), due 1 August 2016, an  expected Long-term local currency rating of 'AAA(EXP)'. This is Bremen's fourth  issue to be rated by Fitch. The senior unsecured issue ranks pari passu with all  Bremen's other outstanding debt. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects the strong mutual support mechanisms that apply to all  members of the German Federation, including the State of Bremen, and the  extensive liquidity facilities they benefit from, which ensure timely debt and  debt service payment.  Fitch notes that the support mechanisms apply uniformly to all members of the  German Federation: the Federal Republic of Germany (AAA/Stable/F1+) represented  by the federal government (Bund) and the 16 federated states, which includes the  State of Bremen undertaking this issue. All Laender are equally entitled to  financial support in the event of financial distress irrespective of differences  in economic and financial performances. The State of Bremen is located in northern Germany and had a population of about  663,300 inhabitants at end-2013. The city-state is the smallest of the 16 German  states and consists of the cities Bremen and Bremerhaven. Its EUR28.6bn GDP  accounted for 1% of national GDP in 2013. Its GDP per capita of EUR43,085 is the  second highest among the German states and 29% above Germany's average of  EUR33,355.  The new EUR250m issue's liquidity is underpinned by the safe cash management  system the Laender operate in, which allows overnight cash exchanges between  Laender and the Bund when necessary, and recourse to appropriate short-term  credit lines. The issue is zero risk-weighted and European Central Bank  repo-eligible.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
