MADRID, July 25 (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank <CABK.MC> intends to take around 7 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in new long-term loans being offered by the European Central Bank, Chief Executive Gonzalo Gortazar told a news conference on Friday.

"The intention is to take that amount in the auctions," Gortazar said.  The ECB said in June it would give banks fresh access to long-term liquidity with the aim of improving lending to euro zone companies, in two so-called targeted longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be held in September and December of this year.
