July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Dufry Finance S.C.A.'s [DURYF.UL] EUR500m eight-year 4.5% senior unsecured notes a final rating of 'BB'. The assignment of the final ratings follows a review of final documentation  which materially conforms to the information received at the time of the  expected rating assignment (see "Fitch Rates Dufry's EUR500m 2022 Senior Notes  'BB(EXP)'' dated 8 July 2014 at www.fitchratings.com). The bond is rated at the same level as Dufry AG's Issuer Default Rating of 'BB'  as it ranks equally with the company's senior unsecured debt, including its  existing USD500m 2020 notes, its term loans and its revolving credit facility.  Dufry is using the proceeds to finance the acquisition of the Nuance Group,  along with funds from the mandatory convertible notes and the rights issue. The  increased indebtedness related to the Nuance acquisition was included in Fitch's  recent rating affirmation of Dufry on 5 June 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Business Scale Strengthened The acquisition of Nuance materially increases Dufry's market leadership and  scope of operations. In the travel retail industry, Fitch views this as  paramount for maintaining the high quality of concessions and for increasing  operational efficiencies.  Increased Footprint Dufry will benefit from Nuance's complementary presence in the Mediterranean  region, Asia and the US. Given that over 80% of Dufry's pipeline projects  involve new concessions and expansions in these geographies, Fitch views the  complementary geographic nature of the transaction as highly accretive to  Dufry's long-term business development goals.  Mixed Impact on Concession Portfolio The acquisition will allow Dufry to expand and diversify its concession  portfolio and add a number of profitable contracts. An overall shorter  concession lifetime and a higher share of concessions with minimum guaranteed  payments will slightly elevate Dufry's operating leverage. However, given  Dufry's historically high concession renewal rates of 80%, the curtailed  concession lifetime does not materially diminish business visibility. We expect  the average profitability of Nuance's concessions to converge with that of  Dufry's, through discontinuation of less profitable contracts and renegotiation  of new concessions with predominantly variable fee structures. The unprofitable Australian operations of Nuance are not deemed as strategically  important to Dufry, and most of these unprofitable concessions are expiring over  the next quarters.  Cash Generation to Remain Strong Given Nuance's weaker profitability, the acquisition will sustainably compress  Dufry's EBITDA margins by 1%-2% below the historical average of 14%. As a  result, Fitch estimates that forecast funds from operations (FFO) as a  percentage of sales will be consistently below historical levels of 11%-12% by  2%-3%. However, in the absence of any major incremental capital spend above the  company's target of 3.5% of sales, free cash flow (FCF) generation is projected  to remain strong and expand over the rating horizon. Even with lower  profitability, Dufry would still rank among the top performers in the travel  retail sector such as World Duty Free.  Credit Metrics under Pressure in FY14-15 As a result of the acquisition, Fitch expects FCF as a percentage of sales to  drop to below 4% (FYE13: 5.4%), with FFO adjusted leverage after dividends paid  to associates at around 6.0x in FY14 (based on actual contribution from Nuance  in 2H14) and remaining above 5.5x in FY15. We consider the deterioration in  credit metrics will be temporary, limited to the business integration period,  which is expected to be restored in FY16 once the combined business starts  generating normalised levels of cash flow. If FFO-adjusted gross leverage remains sustainably above 5.5x, for example, as a  result of a more onerous integration process, weaker FCF or a delay in the  equity placement as part of the financing package, this could put pressure on  the ratings.  Further Debt-Funded Acquisitions Likely In the consolidating and highly competitive travel retail industry, we expect  acquisitions will remain an essential strategy to deliver growth and protect  profitability. As long as future acquisitions are accretive to Dufry's internal  cash generation and the company remains disciplined in its financial policy,  Fitch will continue to factor small add-on acquisitions into the ratings.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: -FFO-adjusted leverage remaining at around 5.0x in the medium term, due to an  adverse shift in the operating environment, persisting organic issues and/or  continuing appetite for debt-funded acquisitions -EBITDA margin below 12%, coupled with FCF margin below 4%, both on a sustained  basis -FFO fixed charge cover sustainably below 2.5x  Positive: Although an upgrade is unlikely in the near term, future developments  that could lead to positive rating action include: - FFO adjusted leverage declining to below 4.0x and fixed charge cover rising  above 3.0x on a sustained basis  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE
