July 25 (Reuters) - Orion Engineered Carbons S.A. <OEC.N> raised about $350 million in an initial public offering (IPO) in New York on Friday in which the carbon black producer issued shares at $18 each.

The issuance price was below the company's initial price range of $21-$24. The placement of 19.5 million common shares gives Orion a free float of about 32.5 percent, a spokesman said.  Its shares fell on Friday, trading 1.5 percent lower at $17.72 at 1751 GMT. Orion makes a form of carbon used as a performance additive in coatings, polymers and printing, and in the manufacturing of tires and mechanical rubber goods.
