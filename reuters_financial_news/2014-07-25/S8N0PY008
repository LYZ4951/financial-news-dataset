MADRID, July 25 (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank <CABK.MC> on Friday said net profit in the second quarter more than doubled to 153 million euros ($206 million) from a year ago, beating forecasts as revenue grew more than expected.

Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast net income of 127 million euros.  Caixabank said net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus funding costs, was just over 1 billion euros in the second quarter, up nearly 6 percent on the same period a year ago and mirroring improvements at other Spanish peers.
