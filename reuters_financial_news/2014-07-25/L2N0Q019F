NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Argentine debt negotiators left their meeting with a U.S. court-appointed mediator in New York after barely one hour on Friday, declining to make any comment as they left the building, a Reuters reporter said.

It was the shortest meeting yet held between Argentine officials and Daniel Pollack, raising more questions over the likelihood of the country striking a deal before July 30 with the "holdout" investors suing it for full payment on their bonds. It was unclear if any further talks were planned for Friday.
