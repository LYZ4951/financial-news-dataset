MADRID, July 25 (Reuters) - Spain's Bankia <BKIA.MC> will on Monday announce a 37 percent rise in first-half net profit thanks to improving net interest income, according to a Reuters poll of seven analysts.

Bankia, bailed out at the height of Spain's economic crisis, is expected to report net profit of 378 million euros ($508 million) backed by an almost 30 percent rise in net interest income, a broad measure of what it earns for lending and what it pays out on deposits. The state has started the process of returning Bankia to the private sector, and in the first quarter raised 1.3 billion euros with the sale of a 7.5 percent stake in the bank. Bad loan rates, a hangover from the end of the property bubble, are expected to remain roughly unchanged at around 14 percent.  The group holds a news conference at 0800 GMT on Monday following the publication of results.
