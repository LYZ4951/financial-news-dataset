July 25 (Reuters) - U.S. baby product retailer Destination Maternity Corp <DEST.O> gave up its pursuit of Britain's Mothercare Plc <MTC.L> after having two bid proposals rejected.

Earlier this month Mothercare confirmed it had spurned Destination Maternity's increased proposal that valued the UK firm at 266 million pounds. [ID:nL6N0PD1AN]
