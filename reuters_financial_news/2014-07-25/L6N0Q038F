WARSAW, July 25 (Reuters) - Poland's Bank Zachodni WBK <BZW.WA> is expected to report an 18 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, a Reuters poll of 10 banks and brokerages showed on Friday, largely reflecting a higher net interest income margin.

Poland's third-largest bank, which is controlled by Spanish lender Santander <SAN.MC>, is forecast to report a net profit of 496 million zlotys ($161 million) against last year's 419 million, the poll showed. "The main driver of the net profit growth was a higher net interest margin. The bank adjusted itself to lower interest rates (by cutting deposit yields)," Espirito Santo analyst Kamil Stolarski said. Polish interest rates have remained at the historically low level of 2.5 percent since July 2013.
