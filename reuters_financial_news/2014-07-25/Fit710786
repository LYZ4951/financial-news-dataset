July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ulster Bank Limited's (UBL)  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-' and Short-term IDR at 'F1'. Fitch  has downgraded UBL's wholly-owned subsidiary, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited's <FAP.L> (UBIL) Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A-'and Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'.  The Outlooks on the Long-term IDRs are Negative. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed UBL's Viability Rating (VR) at 'ccc' and  assigned a VR of 'ccc' to UBIL. A full list of rating actions is at the end of  this rating action commentary. UBL's and UBIL's VRs reflect the entities' weak asset quality and structural  unprofitability, which affects the capital flexibility and potential long-term  viability of the banks. The downgrade of UBIL's IDRs reflects Fitch's view that  UBIL's strategic importance to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc <RBS.L> (RBSG;  A/Negative) is likely to diminish over the rating horizon and that sale risk may  be higher as a result. KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs AND SUPPORT RATINGS UBL's and UBIL's IDRs and Support Ratings (SR) are based on support from parent  RBSG. The ratings of RBSG are derived from the extremely high probability of  support that it would receive from the UK authorities, if required. Fitch  considers UBL and UBIL to be strategically important subsidiaries of RBSG due to  their important role within the group and high reputational risk for the parent  of a subsidiary default. The two-notch gap to 'BBB+' for UBIL takes into account  Fitch's opinion that the Republic of Ireland business's role within the group  may become less important to RBSG over the next three to five years and our view  that the potential for disposal is higher than in the increasingly more  integrated Northern Ireland operations, which are housed in UBL.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs AND SRs  UBL's and UBIL's SRs, Long-term IDRs and Long-term senior debt ratings are  sensitive to Fitch's assumptions about the on-going availability of  extraordinary sovereign support to RBSG. Changes in assumptions could be driven  by a reduction in either the sovereign's ability (for example, triggered by a  downgrade of the UK's sovereign rating) or propensity to provide such support.  In Fitch's view, there is a clear intention ultimately to reduce implicit state  support for systemically important banks in the UK (and more broadly in the EU),  as demonstrated by a series of legislative, regulatory and policy initiatives.  We expect the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) to be  implemented into national legislation later in 2014 or in 1H15. In Fitch's view,  these regulatory developments will increase the likelihood of senior debt losses  in banks if they fail solvability assessments.  Following this rating action, RBSG's rating is likely to be downgraded to its VR  and Fitch would then notch the UBL and UBIL's ratings from RBSG's VR; we expect  this to result in a downgrade of UBL's and UBIL's IDRs and SRs.  UBL's and UBIL's SRs and Long-term IDRs are also sensitive to a change in RBSG's  propensity to provide support to them.  KEY RATING DRIVERS- VRs  UBL's and UBIL's VRs of 'ccc' consider weak asset quality and continued  increases in NPLs which are slowing but have begun to reduce in systemically  important peers. In addition, the group has been loss-making for several years  and has additional challenges over the next 24 months as the bank incurs costs  relating to increased integration for UBL with RBSG and the restructuring and  repositioning of UBIL. The lack of earnings potential compromises UBL and UBIL's  capital flexibility and compromises the entities' long-term viability. On a  positive note, a significant part of UBIL and UBL's 2013 loss related to  additional impairments on assets that have been marked for accelerated sale as  part of the RBS Capital Resolution programme, which improved provisioning levels  and reduced the tail risk from deleveraging.RATING SENSITIVITIES - VRs  UBL and UBIL's VRs could be upgraded once asset quality begins to stabilise,  together with a sustainable return to profitability that would provide capital  flexibility. Downside risk is limited in the near term as solvency is protected  by a modest capital buffer and relatively healthy levels of provisioning on  impaired loans.  The rating actions are as follows:  UBL Long-term IDR: affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook Negative  Short-term IDR: affirmed at 'F1' Viability Rating: affirmed at 'ccc' Support Rating: affirmed at '1'   UBIL Long-term IDR: downgraded to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; Outlook Negative  Short-term IDR: downgraded to 'F2' from 'F1' Viability Rating: assigned at 'ccc'
