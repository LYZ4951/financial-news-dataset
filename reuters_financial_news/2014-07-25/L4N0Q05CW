July 25 (Reuters) - Fitch affirmed its long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings (IDR) of "BBB" on Russia, citing "deteriorating" security situation in Eastern Ukraine that has strained its relations with the European Union (EU) and United States.

The outlook of Russia's IDRs is negative, according to the ratings agency.
