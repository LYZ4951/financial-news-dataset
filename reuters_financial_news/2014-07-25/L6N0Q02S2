PRAGUE, July 25 (Reuters) - Czech billionaire property developer Radovan Vitek has launched a mandatory buyout offer for shares in German real estate group GSG <O5G.DE>, the company said.

Vitek holds 94 percent of GSG after folding his own real estate group into the company this year and is offering to buy remaining shares at a price of 0.53 per share.  The offer runs through Aug. 21 and was launched through Vitek's firm Materali, GSG said in a filing late on Thursday. GSG shares were trading up 0.8 percent at 0.523 euros in Frankfurt on Friday. The company, renamed from Orco Germany this year, is a former unit of Orco Property Group <ORCO.PA> <ORCO.PR>, of which Vitek is the biggest shareholder with a 30.7 percent stake. Orco has been hard hit by a drop in the real estate market in central Europe since the 2008 global economic crisis and posted a record loss due to write-offs in 2013.
