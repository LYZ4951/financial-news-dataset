July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Impairment reserves for banks are likely to rise as a  result of new accounting rules published yesterday that introduce an  expected-loss approach for loan-loss provisioning, Fitch Ratings says.  But additional provisions will not necessarily hit regulatory capital for all  banks as technical differences will remain in the financial statements and  regulatory reporting definitions of expected losses. Banks using internal models under Basel's advanced approach calculate their own  expected loss for regulatory capital calculation, rather than relying directly  on accounting impairments. Therefore the effect of higher impairment charges as  a result of the new accounting standard is likely to be moderated for these  banks, depending on each bank's new level of provisions compared with the  regulatory expected loss.  In contrast, banks under the Basel standardised approach do not calculate a  regulatory expected loss and specific impairments flow directly into regulatory  capital. Therefore, the impact of these accounting changes may be more  significant for banks and portfolios under the standardised approach. Regulatory and accounting 'expected loss' are quite different, although  confusingly they share the same name. The regulatory calculation requires  12-month expected losses to be recognised and its scope is limited to portfolios  under the internal models for regulatory capital. IFRS conversely, requires full  lifetime losses to be recognised for some assets and applies to all loans at  amortised cost. The regulatory approach also requires 'downturn' losses in the  'loss given default' calculation - a key input into the expected loss - whereas  the accounting framework reflects current conditions. The new accounting standard is intended to be more forward-looking, allowing  management to factor forecast changes in conditions into the impairment charge.  It will make provisioning more prudent (it will increase impairments) but at the  cost of additional complexity. Implementation will involve considerable  judgement and add to the degree of subjectivity already inherent in loan loss  provisions.  We believe the increased disclosure proposed in the new IFRS standard is  essential to improve transparency and will benefit users, particularly when  combined with the take-up of recommendations around credit risk reporting by the  Enhanced Disclosure Task Force. However, meaningful comparisons between  provisions reported by US GAAP and IFRS banks will still be difficult, as the  standards differ.
