LAGOS, July 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria's interbank lending rate climbed to 11.12 percent on Friday, compared with 10.50 percent last week, after a central bank open market operation (OMO) drained cash from the system.

Traders said the regulator sold OMO bills worth 415 billion naira ($2.6 billion), soaking up liquidity from banks and driving up lending rates. Lenders have been unable to access their cash balances with the central bank for the third week, owing to a system glitch, meaning that banks have been dealing with their own cash flows rather than on sector-wide liquidity, traders said. The open buy-back (OBB) rate climbed to 10.75 percent from 10.50 percent, 1.25 percentage points below the central bank's benchmark interest rate of 12 percent.
