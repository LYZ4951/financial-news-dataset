WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday approved a resubmitted capital plan from Zions Bancorporation <ZION.O>, part of an annual stress test of banks' financial robustness.

In March, the Fed objected to the bank's 2014 capital plan because it did not meet the minimum 5 percent capital requirement in a simulated economic downturn.
