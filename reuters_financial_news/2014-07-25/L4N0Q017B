July 25 (Reuters) - Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] said on Friday it had sold all of its remaining shares in New China Life Insurance (NCI) <1336.HK>, on the back of a 27 percent rally in the stock over the past year.

Temasek sold 78 million shares in NCI, China's third-largest life insurer at HK$27.45 each raising $2.14 billion ($276 million), after offering the stock in a HK$27.30 to HK$27.85 per share indicative range, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters. The shares were down 4.5 percent at HK$27.73 by Friday afternoon, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was flat. "We can confirm the divestment of our entire stake," a Temasek spokesman said, without giving the deal value.
