July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has today affirmed Export Import Bank  of Malaysia Berhad's (MEXIM) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) at 'A-', Support Rating at '1' and Support Rating Floor at 'A-'. The  Outlook on the rating is Negative. A full list of rating actions is at the end  of this rating action commentary.   KEY RATING DRIVERS MEXIM's IDR, Support Rating Floor and senior debt rating are equalised with that  of the Malaysian sovereign. This reflects Fitch's expectations of an extremely  high probability of state support being available to MEXIM, if necessary. This  expectation also drives the Support Rating of '1'. MEXIM's modest size in proportion to the overall size of Malaysia's GDP and the  domestic banking sector implies that the sovereign should have the ability to  support the bank in times of need. Moreover, the sovereign is expected to have a  very high propensity to provide extraordinary support to the bank, if necessary,  as MEXIM fulfils a unique policy role to support and develop the export-oriented  sector, an area of strategic importance to Malaysia's economic development. The Negative Outlook on MEXIM's ratings corresponds to the Negative Outlook on  the Malaysian sovereign ratings.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings of MEXIM and its senior notes are sensitive to any deterioration in  the sovereign's creditworthiness and ratings, and also to any perceived  weakening in the sovereign's propensity to support the bank. MEXIM's ratings may be notched downwards from the sovereign's ratings, if Fitch  believes that the sovereign's propensity to support the bank has weakened.  However, this is not expected to occur in the near to medium term. MEXIM's gross loans and contingent credit commitments grew 31% in 2013, meeting  its target of 30% annual growth in business volumes. The bank has worked to  improve the credit quality of its exposures over the last few years. However,  credit costs are expected to remain volatile due to the concentrated nature of  the bank's lending - a consequence of its mandated policy role. MEXIM relies on  wholesale funding, largely sourced from commercial banks and capital markets,  and the bank's quasi-sovereign status underpins its stable funding profile. Capital generation is weak due to the periodic development of large loan losses,  and capitalisation may be eroded by the bank's rapid balance sheet growth.  However, MEXIM's capital remains high, with a Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio  (CAR) of 35.3% and a total CAR of 36.0% at end-2013.
