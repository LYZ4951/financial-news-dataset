July 25 (Reuters) - Empik Media & Fashion, owner of some of Poland's largest retailers of books, music and stationery, has signed a 400 million zlotys ($129.9 million) loan agreement with lenders Pekao <PEO.WA>, BZ WBK <BZW.WA> and Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>.

EM&F will use the money to pay off its existing debt and maintain short-term liquidity, it said in a statement. The company's core businesses, based around a network of bookstores, has been hurt by a shift among consumers to buying online. As a part of the loan agreement, EM&F's Stockholm-based subsidiary EM&F Financing AB is issuing 240 million euros ($322.4 million) worth of bonds maturing in 2020. Since the beginning of the year EM&F's share price has fallen by 27 percent, bringing the market capitalisation of the company down to 1.06 billion zlotys, or 24 percent less than the amount of money EM&F is borrowing.
