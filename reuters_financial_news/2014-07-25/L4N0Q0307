MUMBAI, July 25 (Reuters) - India's broader NSE index fell on Friday after hitting a record high for a third straight day as investors took profits in blue-chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS>, while IT outsourcing firms declined after Wipro's <WIPR.NS> U.S. dollar revenue growth lagged rivals.

The stock markets also tracked global shares lower after a week of largely reassuring economic signals but rising political tensions. [MKTS/GLOB] Sentiment was also hit as foreign portfolio investors sold 2.80 billion rupees of Indian index futures and options contracts on Thursday. In the near term, the markets would be driven by the ongoing earnings season, with Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS>, ICICI Bank and Maruti Suzuki India <MRTI.NS> reporting results in the coming week and the central bank's policy review on Aug. 5. "Risk reward has become slightly unfavourable. Correction is part of the course. But, it's still a buy-on-dips market," said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, chief strategist and head of research at brokerage SMC Global Securities. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> fell 0.51 percent, or 40.15 points, to end at 7,790.45. Still, the index rose 1.65 percent for the week, marking its second consecutive weekly gain. The NSE earlier rose 0.13 percent to hit its third consecutive record high at 7,840.95. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> lost 0.55 percent, or 145.10 points, to end at 26,126.75, while rising 1.9 percent for the week. It earlier rose 0.1 percent to hit its second straight all-time high at 26,300.17. A bout of profit-taking hit Indian shares on Friday, sending ICICI Bank Ltd down 2 percent after the stock had gained 12.1 percent over the past eight sessions, while Hindalco Industries Ltd <HALC.NS> fell 3.1 percent on profit-taking after gaining in the last three sessions. Meanwhile Wipro Ltd fell 4.5 percent after the software services exporter's U.S. dollar revenue growth in June-quarter lagged its larger rivals. [ID:nL4N0Q01FR] Infosys Ltd <INFY.NS> lost 0.9 percent, while Tech Mahindra <TEML.NS> fell 0.1 percent. Biocon Ltd <BION.NS> slumped 7.3 percent after June-quarter earnings lagged some analysts' estimates. [ID:nL4N0Q02CR] Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd <MOSS.NS> fell 1 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock, citing demanding valuations. [ID:nL4N0Q01GC] However, defensive stocks such as consumer and healthcare gained on portfolio de-risking. Hindustan Unilever <HLL.NS> added 3.2 percent, while Sun Pharmaceutical Industries <SUN.NS> gained 4.5 percent.
