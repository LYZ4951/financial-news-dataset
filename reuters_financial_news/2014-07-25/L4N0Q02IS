HANOI, July 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> lost 0.32 percent on Friday, coming down from a near four-month high the previous day, with lender BIDV <BID.HM> bucking the trend to reach its highest since May 7 on news of its 2013 dividend plan.

The bank was up 3.38 percent, with 17.4 million shares traded, the highest volume in four months, Reuters data showed.
