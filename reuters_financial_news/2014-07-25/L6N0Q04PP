LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday, with the German market hit after business sentiment in the country fell to its lowest level in nine months, while luxury goods group LVMH <LVMH.PA> slumped after weaker-than-expected results.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> provisionally closed 0.8 percent lower at 1,371.21 points. The German DAX <.GDAXI> equity index was down by 1.6 percent after a survey by the respected Ifo think-tank showed that German business sentiment had fallen to its lowest level in nine months in July.
