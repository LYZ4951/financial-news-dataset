BUENOS AIRES, July 25 (Reuters) - Argentina will continue to talk with the mediator in its battle with holdout creditors over the coming days, the country's economy ministry said on Friday after its delegation left face-to-face negotiations in New York.

"Continuing the process of dialogue underway, we went into further depth into the different aspects of the dispute and diverse alternatives," the ministry said in a statement.
