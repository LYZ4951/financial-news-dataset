NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - How much should investors worry about the recent activity in the high-yield market? Strategists often look at this sector as a precursor to things that can happen in the equity market or in markets in general, seeing the rush in speculative debt issuance as one that portends downfalls later on.

Through the first half of the year, global high yield issuance was up 9 percent from first-half 2013 as companies have had no trouble raising funds when they wanted. Right now the business cycle is in a bit of a weird place as companies aren't quite funding speculative long-term projects that they do at the end of long economic cycles, but they're certainly taking on a substantial amount of debt, in no small part thanks to the interest in such types of funds from pension funds and investors seeking yield but yet not interested in heading into the equity market.  That ongoing interest in high yield has caused a big rally in the sector - but of late some of the enthusiasm has waned, with the riskiest high-yield bonds seeing their spreads against Treasuries widen to 669 basis points, compared with 627 basis points one month ago. It follows on the heels of the worst week of outflows for high yield funds - nearly $2.4 billion - since June of 2013, according to the folks at Lipper. That may be a short-term phenomenon given the natural inclination of investors to flee at signs of trouble, and the flare-up of issues in the Middle East and the downing of a Malaysian airliner in Ukraine contributed to that feeling.  Still, the sharp move prompted Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Americas research at Lipper, to say that with spreads as tight as they are, "We're probably watching the first cracks in the high-yield market as investors come to expect better yields before they buy back in."  It wouldn't be surprising to see some kind of pullback given the year's returns. The CCC-and-lower index is up 5.58 percent on the year while the broader BAC-Merrill US High Yield Index has returned 5.22 percent year-to-date. Yes, that's trailing the stock market, but recall that bonds weren't expected to do anything at all this year, and yet they've managed to keep rolling along anyway.  The question is, again, whether the good days are running short, and in terms of short-term returns, that's certainly possible - for the month the overall index is down 0.4 percent, and the high yield CCC index is down nearly 0.5 percent.
