HONG KONG, July 25 (Reuters) -    ** Greek banking shares <.FTATBNK> rose 5.4 percent on Friday, outperforming a 1 percent rise by European peers <.SX7P>

** Gains attributed to Greek PM dismissing scenarios for snap polls. ** Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said on Thursday he believed Greece's parliament would agree to elect a new president next year without having to call early elections, according to the semi-official Athens News Agency. ** His comments eased concerns that the government would fail to gather a minimum of 180 deputies, required to elect a new president. ** "Banking shares have had big losses since early June," said an Athens based trader who declined to be named. "But Samaras' statements weakened the political risk and this is giving investors a reason to start buying."  ** Greek bank shares have lost 13 percent since mid-June.
