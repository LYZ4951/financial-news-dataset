July 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings (Thailand) Limited has revised  Thailand-based GMM Grammy Public Company Limited's <GRAMMY.BK> (GMM) Outlook to Positive  from Stable and affirmed its National Long-Term Rating at 'BBB+(tha)'. At the  same time, the agency has affirmed its National Short-Term Rating at 'F2(tha)'.  The rating action follows GMM's announcement that its pay TV business and CTH  Public Company Limited (CTH), one of Thailand's major pay TV operators, would  swap shares. The Positive Outlook reflects GMM's lower exposure to execution risk of the pay  TV business following the transaction and an improved financial profile, once  the pay TV business is deconsolidated.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Deconsolidating Pay TV Business: GMM's share swap deal with CTH to offload its  loss-making pay TV business is positive to its credit profile. GMM's pay TV  business will be integrated with CTH's pay TV operation, in which GMM will own  10%. The transaction will result in the deconsolidation of pay TV operations  from GMM's financial statements. Better Projected Credit Profile: The transaction will reduce GMM's exposure to  execution risks in the pay-TV business, and allow the company to focus financial  and management resources on its new digital TV business. Fitch expects GMM's  earnings and cash flow to improve in 2015 due to a reduction in pay TV-related  costs, including cash operating cost (THB700m-800m) and capex for content  acquisition (THB600m-1bn). This will be more than enough to offset the  subscription revenue foregone (THB1bn-1.2bn).  Remaining Challenges for Digital TV: The transaction will improve GMM's leverage  outlook in the medium term - FFO-adjusted net leverage is likely to fall below  3.5x in 2015 and 2016 from over 5.0x expected at end-2014. However, before  upgrading GMM's rating to 'A-(tha)', Fitch would expect GMM to be able to  demonstrate a strong cash flow generation from its digital TV business and a  sustained positive free cash flow. Nevertheless, the Positive Outlook indicates  that these conditions may be met within two years. Expanding Broadcasting: Digital TV is likely to be a key growth driver for GMM  in the medium term. The company launched digital TV channels in May 2014, after  it won the bidding for two licences in December 2013. The company aims to move  most of its content from satellite TV channels to the new digital TV platform,  while gradually adding new programmes to the new digital TV platform to be in  line with the expected advertising revenue growth. The likely higher advertising  rates for digital free TV due to wider viewer coverage than that of satellite TV  should boost the group's revenue in the medium term. However, the size and  presence of a number of new operators in the digital TV market may lead to  higher price competition than expected. Margin Pressure: Low earnings from the digital TV business will put pressure on  GMM's profit margin in 2014. Nonetheless, the profit margin is likely to improve  in 2015 and 2016 as revenues from digital TV increases. With the operating costs  of this business largely fixed, a large proportion of any increase in revenue  translates into profit.  Large Investment: Fitch expects the high digital TV licence fee to result in  negative free cash flow and limited financial flexibility for GMM for at least  two years. However, the likely increase in earnings after 2015 is likely to  improve GMM's financial leverage.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - The company demonstrates strong cash flow generation from its digital TV  business, leading to positive free cash flow while FFO-adjusted net leverage is  below 3.5x, both on a sustained basis. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:
