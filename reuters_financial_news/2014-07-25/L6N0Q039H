LAGOS, July 25 (Reuters) - Trading resumed on the Nigerian bourse on Friday after a network fault disrupted buy and sell orders the previous day.

The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) said the cause of the disruption was a network fault and had nothing to do with the new Nasdaq X-Stream platform that it introduced last year.  Stockbrokers told Reuters that a technical glitch had prevented trading on the bourse on Thursday. [ID:nL6N0PZ6UD] The main index <.NGSEINDEX> was down 0.9 percent at 42,145 points at 1126 GMT on Friday. The bourse had said late on Thursday that its engineers and technical partners were working to resolve the network issue.  Sub-Saharan Africa's second-biggest index, which has gained just under 3 percent this year, adopted the Nasdaq X-Stream trading platform in October and has said the new technology will improve the speed of transactions.
