LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - Britain's Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> confirmed on Friday that it was close to agreeing a settlement over allegations of manipulating benchmark interest rates.    "LBG confirms that it is in late-stage settlement discussions with a number of agencies," the bank said in statement.

Two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters late on Thursday that Lloyds would announce a fine next week in connection with a global scandal over the fixing of the London Interbank Offered Rate.
