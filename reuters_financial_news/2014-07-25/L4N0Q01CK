SEOUL, July 25 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged up on Friday as foreign investors continued to buy, while the won <KRW=> fell, although on a weekly basis it rebounded from two weeks of losses.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.36 percent at 2,033.85. Prices are expected to gain further next week if offshore investors continue to be net buyers, but the market will also be watching results from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> and Naver Corp <035420.KS>. Foreign investors bought a net 64 billion won ($62.39 million) of KOSPI shares but retail investors sold a net 149 billion won ($145.25 million), weighing on the main board.
