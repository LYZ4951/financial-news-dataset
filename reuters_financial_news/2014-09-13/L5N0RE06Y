KIEV, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Ukraine's economy may contract by as much as 10 percent this year, the head of the country's central bank said on Saturday, much more than the 6.5 percent previously predicted by the International Monetary Fund.

"I suppose this (decline) could be minus 9 percent, or even minus 10 percent," Interfax Ukraine quoted Valeria Hontareva as saying.
