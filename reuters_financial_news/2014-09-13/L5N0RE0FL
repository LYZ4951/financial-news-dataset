LISBON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The three key executives charged with rebuilding Portugal's Novo Banco - the successor to Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> after a state rescue last month - said on Saturday they had tendered their resignations.

The announcement followed a reported disagreement over strategy with the central bank. [ID:nL5N0RE079] Chief Executive Vitor Bento, Financial Director Joao Moreira Rato and Deputy Chief Executive Jose Honorio said in a joint statement they had communicated to the Bank of Portugal their intention to resign earlier this week "giving time to prepare a smooth transition to a new management team".
