PARIS, April 3 (Reuters) - Shares in French electrical equipment supplier Rexel <RXL.PA> dropped 2.4 percent on Thursday as traders said shareholder Ray Investment sold another 27 million shares, or a 9.5 percent stake in the group.

Goldman Sachs and UBS were the bookrunners for the placement, done at a price of 18.85 euros a share, a discount of 2.9 percent compared with the stock's closing price of 19.41 euros on Wednesday, traders said. Ray Investment had already sold a 7 percent stake in Rexel last December. [ID:nL6N0JW240]
