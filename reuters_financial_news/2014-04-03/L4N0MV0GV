SYDNEY, April 4 (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said it would let Transurban Group <TCL.AX>, the country's biggest toll road owner, buy Queensland state-owned toll road owner Queensland Motorways Ltd, concluding that a deal would not substantially reduce competition.

Transurban, superannuation fund conglomerate AustralianSuper and the state-run Abu Dhabi Investment Authority form one of the three international groups bidding for QML, the largest of several Australian privatisations with an expected price tag around A$5 billion ($4.6 billion).
