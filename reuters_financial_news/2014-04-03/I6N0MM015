MILAN, April 3 (Reuters) - U.S. fund manager BlackRock <BLK.N>, which has bought stakes in several Italian lenders over the past two months, has a 6.851 percent stake in Italian cooperative lender Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI>, Italy's market regulator said on Thursday.

The regulator said in a statement the holding dated back to March 31, the day on which Banco Popolare launched a 1.5 billion euro ($2.06 billion) capital increase.  BlackRock is now the biggest shareholder in Banco Popolare, Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>. It is also the second biggest investor in Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>.
