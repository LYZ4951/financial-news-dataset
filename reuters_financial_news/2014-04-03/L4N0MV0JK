HONG KONG, April 3 (Reuters) - Sun Hung Kai & Co Ltd <0086.HK> has appointed three banks to underwrite the sale of its consumer finance division, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

The Hong Kong conglomerate chose JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG to run the sale, which is expected to value the business - United Asia Finance Ltd - at around $3 billion, the people said. "The consideration of a potential separate listing of UAF remains at a preliminary stage," one of the people said.
