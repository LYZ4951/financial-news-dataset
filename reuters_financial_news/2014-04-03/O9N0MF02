OSLO, April 3 (Reuters) - The Norwegian real estate association (EFF) will have to revise upwards their estimates for Norwegian house prices if the current price development continues, the agency's chief said on Thursday after reporting housing figures for March.

"There are tendencies of a shift in the trend to a more positive development ... Growth is significantly stronger than we expected," Christian Vammervold Dreyer told a news conference.
