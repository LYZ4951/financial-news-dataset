Fitch Ratings has launched the RMBS Compare, an Excel  tool that provides easy access to Fitch's surveillance and index data on  European RMBS.

"Analysts can compare the key characteristics of a transaction with  others in the sector, as well as averages for the product types, vintages and  originators."   RMBS Compare's main features are: - Compare transaction performance with others and with Fitch benchmarks - Compare originators, vintages and product types - Compare housing market and macroeconomic indicators - Compare a selected portfolio of transactions - Links to the full data history for each transaction - Visualise comparisons with customisable charts and tables for inclusion in  documents  The RMBS Compare initially includes data covering The Netherlands, Spain,  Ireland and Greece, with UK data to be added shortly and other European  countries to be included in the coming months.
