MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuters) - U.S. bank JP Morgan <JPM.N> said on Thursday it would process a payment from Russia's embassy in Kazakhstan to Russian insurance agency Sogaz after blocking it earlier this week over Ukraine-related U.S. sanctions.    "Following consultation with our regulators, we are processing this transaction," the bank said in a statement.

Russia's Foreign Ministry accused the bank on Tuesday of "illegally" blocking a payment from one of its embassies to an insurance agency "under the pretext of anti-Russian sanctions".
