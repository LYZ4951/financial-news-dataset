OSLO, April 3 (Reuters) - Norwegian bank DNB's <DNB.OL> life insurance business expects new reserve requirements tied to existing pension contracts to result in a charge of 100 million crowns ($16.74 million) in the first quarter, it said on Thursday.

The announcement comes after the Nordic country's financial regulator said on Wednesday insurers would be allowed to use up to seven years to meet the requirements, rather than the five years originally proposed. [ID:nWEB00L4Z]
