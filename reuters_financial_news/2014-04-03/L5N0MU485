MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuters) - Novorossiisk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP) Group <NMTP.MM> said on Thursday it swung to a net loss in 2013 due to foreign exchange losses and a goodwill impairment charge.

The port operator, which provides the largest outlets for Russian energy and commodity exports, reported a $105 million net loss compared with a $316 million net profit in 2012.
