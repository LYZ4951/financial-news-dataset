STOCKHOLM, April 3 (Reuters) - After three IPOs on the main list of the Stockholm stock exchange so far this year, Nasdaq OMX Stockholm's top executive said on Thursday that market conditions looked favourable after the first quarter.

Trading volumes on the Stockholm stock exchange increased by 26 percent in March compared to last year, up to a daily average of 16 billion Swedish crowns ($2.47 billion). Since November last year - after more than two years of drought for stock market flotations - the exchange has seen five IPOs on the main list. A strong capital flow into shares combined with low volatility, which makes valuations attractive, has led more companies to the stock exchange, Nasdaq OMX Stockholm CEO Magnus Billing told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference. "The first quarter was strong both regarding raised capital and the number of listings", he said. "If we look at 2013, it ended up a very good year for us. But 2014 has started out even better. If we see this kind of development in Q2, Q3 and Q4, 2014 will be a good year". He added that even though he had a positive view on 2014, the development will - naturally - in part depend on the macro situation. "We hope that the positive signs that we see will strengthen and that we will start to see a substantial growth also among the companies", Billing said. In total, there have been seven new listings on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm lists, four of which were IPOs so far in 2014.  As of today, 258 companies trade on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm. Recipharm <RECIb.ST>, which was listed on Thursday, rose 7.7 percent at 1029 GMT to 84 crowns from its IPO price of 78 crowns per share.
