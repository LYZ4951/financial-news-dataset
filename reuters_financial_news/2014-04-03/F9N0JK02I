FRANKFURT, April 3 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25 percent on Thursday despite a sharp slowdown in inflation in the euro zone.

The decision to leave rates unchanged was expected, though a very small minority of economists polled by Reuters had expected a cut. [ECB/REFI] The ECB also left unchanged the rate it pays on bank overnight deposits at 0.0 percent, and held its marginal lending facility - or emergency borrowing rate - at 0.75 percent.
