LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Spanish shares outperformed flat European markets on Thursday as strong services data strengthened investor optimism about an economic recovery in the struggling southern European country.

Investors refrained from making large bets on pan-European indexes as they waited to see whether the European Central Bank (ECB), due to announce its rate decision later in the day, would give more signs it is ready to take steps to stop disinflation becoming deflation. [ID:nL5N0MT4C8] Spain's Ibex index <.IBEX>, however, rose 0.4 percent, taking its rise since its March low to around 8 percent, as data showed the country's service sector expanded more than expected in March, its fifth straight month of expansion, fuelling hopes of overall economic growth in the first quarter. [ID:nL9N0MI011] The Ibex has risen nearly 40 percent since late June 2013 as the country emerged from a deep recession. The index has outperforming its peers in Europe's core countries, such as Germany's Dax <.GDAXI>.  "Spain is clearly doing its part," Mike Reuter, global equity broker at Tradition. "Bar anything extraordinary happening, the Ibex is going to have a strong year again compared to the Dax." The German index was down 0.1 percent at 0744 GMT, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was flat at 1,343.54 points. The euro zone Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> was also flat, at 3,188.26 points. The FTSEurofirst 300 has risen for the past seven sessions, partly due to speculation that the ECB may signal it is prepared to cut deposit rates below zero - effectively charging banks to hold cash with the bank - or embarking on bond purchases as the United States, Japan and Britain have. However, economists expect the ECB to keep interest rates steady and offer no new aid to the euro zone's fragile recovery despite a fall in inflation to its lowest in more than four years.  "I think the market has got ahead of itself, ahead of the ECB," said Darren Courtney-Cook, head of trading at Central Markets Investment Management. "I don't think we'll do too much ahead of the ECB. My own view is that if they cut, we may rally for a bit and then sell off, and if they don't cut, markets will sell off."   British-listed oil services firm Tullow Oil <TLW.L> topped the FTSEurofirst, rising by around 4 percent, as UBS upgraded the stock to "buy" from "neutral", citing significant upside potential for the group's onshore business.  Tullow suffered a string of disappointing drilling results and lost a quarter of its value in 2013, when it was the worst-performing stock on Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> outside of the mining sector.
