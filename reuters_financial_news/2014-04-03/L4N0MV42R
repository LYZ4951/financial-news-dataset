WELLINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - New Zealand accounting software developer Xero <XRO.NZ> on Friday said its full-year operating revenue jumped 83 percent on increasing subscriptions, but it expected to post another net loss as it invests in global expansion.

The company, which is expanding aggressively in the United States, said operating revenues came in at NZ$70.1 million ($59.87 million) for the year ended March 31, from NZ$38.4 million a year ago.
