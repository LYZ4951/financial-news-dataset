WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee will vote on three candidates for the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Tuesday, after the trio met little resistance from lawmakers in a confirmation hearing last month.

President Barack Obama has nominated Timothy Massad, a senior Treasury Department official, to become the new chairman of the CFTC, which oversees futures and swaps markets. Sharon Bowen, a partner at law firm Latham & Watkins in New York, and Chris Giancarlo, an industry veteran at swaps broker GFI Group Inc <GFIG.N>, are nominated for two other spots on the five-member commission, which decides on the agency's most important rule-makings and enforcement cases. The three met little pushback from the Senate committee, which oversees the CFTC, in a March 6 hearing.
