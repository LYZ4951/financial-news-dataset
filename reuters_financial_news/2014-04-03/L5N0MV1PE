STOCKHOLM, April 3 (Reuters) - Swedish banks operating in Norway should follow the Norwegian financial regulator's new guidelines on how much capital to put aside for mortgages, the Swedish FSA said on Thursday.

Norway plans to more than double risk weights for mortgages to a calculated average of 22.8 percent from the current 10.0 percent. "The (Swedish) FSA believes that Swedish companies operating in the Norwegian mortgage market should apply the same risk weight levels as their Norwegian counterparts," the financial watchdog said on its website.
