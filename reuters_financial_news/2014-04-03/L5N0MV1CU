FRANKFURT, April 3 (Reuters) - French private-equity firm Ardian, recently year spun off from insurer AXA <AXAF.PA>, has raised 500 million euros ($688 million) for small-cap investments.

The buyout group closed its Expansion Fund III after raising 450 million from investors. It has another 50 million euros at its disposal for co-investments, Ardian said in a statement on Thursday.  Ardian's newly launched fund is targeting to buy companies with an enterprise value of up to 150 million euros and has already invested in German frozen food group Frostkrone, French environmental data group CLS Group, French pharma group Synerlab and French smart cart testing group Micropass.
