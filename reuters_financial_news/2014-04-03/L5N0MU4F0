MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuters) - Russian conglomerate Sistema <SSAq.L> <AFKS.MM> said on Thursday its fourth-quarter net profit more than halved year-on-year, due to a foreign exchange loss.

Sistema, whose biggest assets are majority stakes in Russia's top mobile operator MTS <MBT.N> and mid-sized oil firm Bashneft <BANE.MM>, reported a net profit of $47.7 million, down from $180.1 million the year earlier.
