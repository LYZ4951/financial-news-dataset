WARSAW, April 3 (Reuters) - Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> subsidiary mBank <MBK.WA>, Poland's fourth largest bank, is to seek a partner for its insurance arm, launching a process that could include an eventual sale of the business, it said on Thursday.

"Board of mBank granted its consent to conduct activities aimed at the selection of a ... partner for the bank in insurance within the mBank Group," mBank said in a statement. Earlier this year, the bank said it would decide on a possible sale of its insurance arm in the second half of 2014, after media reports said mBank had already sent out invitations to potential bidders. Poland's state-controlled PZU <PZU.WA>, eastern Europe's No.1 insurer, has been tipped as potentially interested. [ID:nL6N0LU2WH]
