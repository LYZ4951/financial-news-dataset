April 3 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $919.9 million jury verdict in favor of DuPont Co <DD.N> in a case over the alleged theft of trade secrets for a fiber used to make Kevlar bulletproof vests.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia said the verdict against South Korea's Kolon Industries Inc <120110.KS> must be voided because the trial judge improperly excluded relevant evidence that was material to Kolon's defense.
