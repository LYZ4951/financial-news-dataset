HANOI, April 3 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.75 percent on Thursday's break as investors picked up stocks after recent strong falls.

Most blue chips gained, led by Vietnam's largest listed firm PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM> with a 1.2 percent advance. Steel producer Hoa Phat <HPG.HM> rose 1.9 percent and Hanoi-based lender VietinBank <CTG.HM> increased 1.2 percent. But trading volume was low as investors were cautious in buying after the index's recent strong falls, analysts said. The index has lost a combined 2.1 percent over the past three straight losses, while trading volume was at 56 million shares by midday, far below the five-day average level of 123 million, Reuters data showed.
