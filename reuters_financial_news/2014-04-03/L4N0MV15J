SEOUL, April 3 (Reuters) - South Korean stocks turned lower on Thursday as investors booked  profits from recent gains, while the won <KRW=> slipped on robust dollar demand after an encouraging U.S. private jobs data for March.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.2 percent at 1,993.70 points, reversing intraday gains and snapping a six day winning streak that propelled the index almost 2.9 percent higher. Foreign buying helped limit broad market losses, with net purchases of 343.4 billion won ($325.02 million) worth of KOSPI shares. This was the seventh straight session of net buying, bringing their total purchase for the period to more than a net 1.8 trillion won.
