April 3 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories in the Wall Street Journal. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

* General Motors Co <GM.N> Chief Executive Mary Barra withstood a second day of withering attacks from lawmakers, with one senator saying the nation's largest auto maker should face criminal liability and another saying she needed to fix its "culture of coverup." (http://link.reuters.com/sys28v)  * Mary Barra learned late about faulty ignition switches. The larger an organization gets, the less likely it is that bad news will travel smoothly up the chain. At big corporations, say organizational experts, doing the right thing is often incompatible with pleasing the boss. (http://r.reuters.com/pys28v)  * Boeing Co <BA.N> said it will try to sell its new aerial refueling tanker to South Korea as its long-running battle with Airbus Group NV <AIR.PA> expands from commercial jets into specialized military aircraft.

(http://link.reuters.com/tys28v)  * Juniper Networks Inc <JNPR.N> is slashing its global workforce by 6 percent. The job cuts that will mostly occur immediately and largely affect middle-management roles. Activist shareholders Jana Partners and Elliott Management Corp have pushed for the network-gear company to make large cuts to costs and enact programs to return capital to shareholders.

The IRS, in a ruling last week, said under existing law bitcoin and its brethren are property, not currency. That means anyone who spends bitcoin, even on a $2 cup of coffee, may have to pay taxes based on any "gain" over that bitcoin's original value.

(http://r.reuters.com/kat28v)  * Pacific Investment Management Co's mutual funds suffered a 10th straight month of redemptions in March, although Pimco's chief executive said there is no link between the firm's management turmoil and the outflows. Investors pulled $7.3 billion out of Pimco last month, following outflows of $2.5 billion in February and $5.7 billion in January, to lift the first-quarter total to more than $15 billion, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc <MORN.O>. (http://link.reuters.com/pat28v)  * Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL] is expected to complete its acquisition of management-consulting firm Booz & Co Thursday and is renaming Booz "Strategy&."
