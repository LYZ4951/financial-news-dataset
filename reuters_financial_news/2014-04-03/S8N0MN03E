MUMBAI, April 3 (Reuters) - Shares in India's IDFC Ltd <IDFC.NS> surged 8.7 percent at pre-open trading after India's central bank on Wednesday granted preliminary licence to the infrastructure sector lender to set up a new bank.

The approval of licences for IDFC Ltd and Bandhan Financial Services marks the start of a cautious experiment for a sector dominated by lethargic state lenders, many of which are reluctant to expand into rural areas or towns where banking penetration is low.
