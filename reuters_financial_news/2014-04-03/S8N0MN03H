MUMBAI, April 3 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Thursday after touching their ninth consecutive record high as state-run banks such as State Bank of India slumped on concerns about losses on their debt portfolios as domestic bonds extended a slide this week.

The benchmark 10-year bond yield <IN088323G=CC> rose to as high as 8.9952 percent, the highest level since Dec. 6 on concerns about tight cash conditions and the resumption of hefty debt auctions by the government. The NSE <.NSEI> provisionally fell 0.24 percent after earlier rising as much as 0.36 percent to a lifetime high of 6,776.75. The fall marked the index's first fall in 10 sessions. The BSE index <.BSESN> fell 0.22 after earlier rising as much as 0.31 percent to a record high of 22,620.65.
