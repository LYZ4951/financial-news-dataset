April 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to  Williamson County, Texas' bonds: --$100 million unlimited tax (ULT) road bonds, series 2014 'AAA';  --$20 million limited tax (LT) park bonds, series 2014 'AAA'.  The bonds are scheduled for a negotiated sale the week of April 7, 2014.   Unlimited tax proceeds will be used for road improvements in the county and to  pay costs of issuance.  Limited tax proceeds will be used for park and  recreational purposes and to pay costs of issuance.In addition, Fitch affirms the 'AAA' rating on the following county bonds:  --$251 million outstanding unlimited tax obligations; --$499 million outstanding limited tax and pass-through toll revenue  obligations. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  SECURITY  The unlimited tax bonds are secured by an unlimited ad valorem tax levied  against all taxable property in the county. The limited tax obligations are  payable from the county's $0.80 constitutional ad valorem tax rate.  The  outstanding pass-through toll revenue and limited tax bonds are payable from  payments received by the county pursuant to a pass-through toll agreement  between the county and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDoT) and  additionally from the county's $0.80 ad valorem tax rate.   KEY RATING DRIVERS STRONG MANAGEMENT, CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE: A history of extensive planning and  conservatism has allowed the county to accommodate a high debt load associated  with providing infrastructure sufficient to meet increasing service levels while  maintaining balanced operations and robust reserves.  However, continued growth  at this rapid pace could lead to further debt pressures and exposure to abrupt  slowdowns. FLEXIBLE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK: The county's relatively low ad valorem tax rate  provides flexibility to meet future obligations. Projected growth in key  spending areas is aligned with reasonable revenue projections. HIGH DEBT BURDEN: Overall debt is high, especially for the rating level,  reflecting rapid regional growth.  Modest pension and other post-employment  benefits (OPEB) keep the fixed-cost burden on the budget from becoming  unmanageable.   PRIME LOCATION; STRONG DEMOGRAPHICS: A strong transportation infrastructure  provides easy access between the county's affordable developable property and  Austin's broad employment base.  Growth prospects are also supported by the  county's highly educated workforce and above-average income levels which Fitch  expects to attract ongoing commercial and industrial development.   RATING SENSITIVITIES FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY: The rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit  characteristics including the county's strong management practices and financial  flexibility. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that such shifts  are unlikely.  CREDIT PROFILE Williamson County occupies a sizable 1,135 acres in central Texas with a  population of 477,219 reflecting 90% growth since the year 2000.  The county  lies just north of Austin along the well-traversed interstate 35. DIVERSIFYING ECONOMY MITIGATES IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY CYCLESWilliamson County's economic activity includes technology, manufacturing,  government, education, retail and agribusiness. The county benefits from an  abundance of high technology firms, including the corporate headquarters of Dell  Computer.  However, increasing diversification and a stabilizing influence of  education, government and health care among top employers have made the county  less susceptible to technology cycle downturns. Strong job creation averaging  3.7% over the past decade also lessens the impact of structural layoffs common  to the competitive technology sector. Several major medical facility expansions are underway and include collaboration  between regional hospitals and higher education campuses.  Other recent notable  additions to the county's employment base include Emerson Process Management's  electronic manufacturing facility, as well as Oracle Corporation and Dana  Corporation facilities.   HEALTHY TAX BASE GROWTH The county's $36 billion tax base has tripled since 2000 largely as a result of  strong residential growth and rising home prices. Growth leveled off during the  recession, but low levels of available housing stock drove taxable assessed  valuation (TAV) gains approximating 3% annually in fiscal 2013 and 2014. The  Williamson County Appraisal District projects fiscal 2015 tax base growth of  10%, largely resulting from growth in existing property values as well as from  ongoing commercial expansion and new development. Prospects for ongoing growth  are strong considering the large number of new areas platted for development  including a notable expansion to Sun City, Texas, the county's 10,500-home,  active retirement community. The tax base is without taxpayer concentration.  BOND PROJECTS PREPARE FOR FUTURE GROWTH Williamson County received strong support from voters in November 2013  authorizing $275 million in ULT road bonds and $40 million in LT bonds for parks  and recreation development and improvements.  Road bonds will fund safety and expansion projects to alleviate congestion and  to continue facilitating well-planned growth projected to reach 1 million in  population in the next two decades.  Transportation projects are identified  through coordinated regional planning efforts with the Capital Area Metropolitan  Planning Organization (CAMPO). The county has a history of strong project  execution supported by sound internal controls and the use of general  engineering consultants and construction administration and inspection experts.  The limited tax bonds will be issued as tender bonds, subject to a mandatory  tender subsequent to an initial bond period after which time the county expects  to redeem or reissue the bonds in fixed rate mode. The transaction does not  require liquidity support, as in the unexpected event of a failed remarketing,  the county will pay a stepped-up interest rate on the outstanding bonds to be  negotiated at pricing. Fitch considers the risk to the county as minimal given  the county's rating and the small amount of debt potentially subject to a  stepped-up interest rate.  HIGH DEBT; AFFORDABLE PENSIONS Fitch anticipates the county's high overall debt equal to 7.7% of market value  to remain elevated based on long-term population growth projections for the  region. With modest unfunded pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB)  liabilities, impact of the county's combined debt service, pension and OPEB on  its budget is sizable at 25% of governmental spending.  The county provides pension benefits through the Texas County and District  Retirement System (TCDRS). Funding levels are satisfactory at nearly 85% (76%  using a more conservative 7% investment return assumption), and the county  routinely funds 100% of its annual required contribution (ARC) to TCDRS.  The  county provides OPEB through a self-funded single-employer plan. The unfunded  actuarial accrued liability is very low at $41 million, representing less than  0.1% of the county's market value.   STRONG FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY The county's conservative financial profile is exemplified by general fund  reserve levels well in excess of policy targets.  A fiscal 2013 unrestricted  general fund balance of $75 million (57.4% of spending) reflects another year of  strong revenue performance and prudent cost management. Officials project  favorable-to-budget fiscal 2014 performance with priorities focused on  competitive compensation and continuing technology improvements.
