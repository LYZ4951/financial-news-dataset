Factors Fueling Rating Lower Rating Headroom: stand-alone credit profile of Indosat at 'BB'  now has a rating lower headroom. Funds flow from operations  (FFO)-adjusted net leverage of the company will still be around 2.4x-2.5x  (2013: 2.5x) - 3.0x closer to the limit where Fitch will be paying particular attention to the action negative ranking. Intense competition in the data segment and the high  capital expenditure requirements will prevent a significant decline in the level of debt  and beyond the positive impact of the sale of 5% stake in PT Tower Bersama  Infrastructure Tbk <TBIG.JK> (BB / Stable) of IDR1.4 trillion (USD120 million) in 2014. Lower Profitability: operating EBITDAR margin of Indosat in 2014  is likely to fall to 40% -42% (2013: 43%) in the midst of competition  strong in the segment data and customer acquisition costs are higher because of segment  voice stagnant. Fitch estimates that the gains from services  data is a major proponent of revenue growth will remain much more  lower than the more traditional segments of voice and text services due  lack of scale and price-based competition from operators more  small. Dollar depreciation: Among the Indonesian telecommunications operators, Indosat is  most exposed to currency depreciation as 47% of debt  is payable in U.S. dollars, in which only 25% dihedging. The company also  pay around USD40-45 million tower lease costs in U.S. dollars  EBITDA cause further exposure to currency risk. in  2013, Indosat adds IDR2.8 trillion of debt or leverage of approximately 0.3x  due to the weakening of the rupiah. Fitch expects that the company will replace  a portion of its debt in U.S. dollars with debt in dollars in 2014. Negative FCF in 2014: FCF of Indosat in 2014 is expected to be  negative (2013 FCF margin: -5%) due to the stagnant FFO will not be enough to  finance the capital expenditures required to support data services  growing rapidly. Capital expenditure / income will be high around  33% -35% (2013: 40.5%) because the company will pursue a competitor in the development  3G service. At the end of December 2013, the company had 5,400 3G base stations, remote  lower than the ownership of PT XL Axiata Tbk <EXCL.JK> (XL, BBB / Stable) at 15,000 and PT  Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk <TLKM.JK> (Telkom, BBB-/Stabil) at 27,000. However, Fitch believes that the strategy of Indosat to deploy  3G technology using spectrum in the 900MHz bandwidth 2 and 2100MHz will  resulting in savings in capital expenditure compared to competitors  most other uses 2100MHz. FCF of Indosat is expected to  became positive in 2015 due to the cost of capital expenditures peaked in  , 2013. Industry Consolidation: Fitch estimates that the industry will consolidate  or smaller telecom operators will raise the tariff for  their business models are not sustainable. Operator Code Division Multiple  Access (CDMA) including PT Bakrie Telecom <BTEL.JK> (C) and Telecom Tbk PT Smartfren <FREN.JK> (CC (idn)) continued difficulty to increase market share and face the problems  liquidity. Indosat and Telkom as the market leader is likely to  CDMA segment stop them and reallocate the spectrum for  use GSM. Support From Parent Company: Indosat final rating at 'BBB'  3 notches into account the increase of stand-alone credit profile at its 'BB'  due to the strategic importance to its parent company - Ooredoo QSC <ORDS.QA> (OOredoo, A + / Stable), which owns 65% of shares. Document debentures and  Ooredoo bonds have cross-default clauses that include children  Significant companies including Indosat. Indosat is one child  company of Ooreedoo growing rapidly and contributing 25% and  26% of the consolidated revenues and EBITDA in 2013.   SENSITIVITY RATINGS Fitch does not expect that the positive ranking of actions will occur due to the leverage of the company will remain high in the medium term.
