MEXICO CITY, April 3 (Reuters) - Citigroup's Mexican unit Banamex must correct mistakes and take steps to prevent future cases like Oceanografia, CEO Javier Arrigunaga said on Thursday, following a scandal which forced the bank to write down millions of dollars in bad loans.

Citigroup <C.N> said in February it uncovered $400 million in bogus loans that Banamex made to oil services company Oceanografia <OCNGR.UL>, and U.S. and Mexican authorities were investigating.
