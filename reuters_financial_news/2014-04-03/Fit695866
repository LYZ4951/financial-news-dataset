April 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Recent comments suggesting that quantitative easing (QE) is becoming a less contentious policy option in the eurozone reduces the risk of deflation in the region, Fitch Ratings says.  European Central Bank Governing Council member and Bundesbank president Jens  Weidmann said last week that the ECB might consider buying "private or public  assets" and that "we are currently discussing the effectiveness of these  measures" as well as possible costs and side-effects. Opposition from the  Bundesbank has long been seen as a potential obstacle to the ECB following the  lead of other global central banks and embarking on QE.  There is no guarantee that discussing QE will result in the launch of a  programme. Nor is there a guarantee that QE would be sufficient in itself to  ward off the spectre of deflation. Nevertheless, considering QE indicates that  the ECB is prepared to add to its unconventional policy tools to tackle the risk  of deflation, if necessary.  We do not currently predict prolonged, self-sustaining deflation in any of the  world's major advanced economies (MAEs), including the eurozone, where we think  economic recovery, coupled with private deleveraging and improved private  funding conditions, will see the region avoid long-lasting deflation, such as  that experienced by Japan from the 1990s. However, the success of "Abenomics" in  breaking Japan out of deflation is still far from assured, illustrating how  pernicious deflation can become once entrenched. We do think that the risk of deflation is higher in the eurozone than in other  MAEs over the next two years. This is partly because eurozone inflation is  already low and falling. Eurostat said Monday that seasonally-adjusted eurozone  consumer price inflation dropped to 0.5% in March from 0.7% in February and well  below the ECB's target of close to, but not at, 2%. This gives little buffer  against any further negative shocks. We also see deflation as a greater risk in the eurozone because of the more  limited policy response readily available to the ECB, which is near the zero  lower bound for nominal interest rates. It is unlikely that experimenting with  mildly negative deposit rates would be transmitted into a meaningful stimulus to  the real economy (see Global Economic Outlook published on 14 March).   It is far from clear what form any eventual QE programme would take, and it  would still face potential political and legal challenges given the prohibition  on monetary financing under the Treaty of the European Union. The pool of  private sector bonds that could be bought is smaller than in, say, the US. And  with core sovereign yields low and spreads between core and periphery yields  compressing, the impact of government bond purchases may be limited.
