LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said it would launch a competition review into the 150 billion pound ($250 billion) credit card market to assess if people in financial trouble are being treated fairly.

The Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday 30 million Britons hold at least one credit card and it would explore whether competition in this market was working effectively for consumers, especially those in difficult financial situations. It said it would launch the review at the end of this year.
