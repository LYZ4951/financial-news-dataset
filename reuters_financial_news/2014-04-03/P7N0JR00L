PRAGUE, April 3 (Reuters) - Shares in real estate developer Orco Property Group <ORCO.PR> <ORCO.PA> slumped by 26 percent in Prague on Thursday, extending sharp falls into a second day after a bank called in a loan that was to finance a large project in Poland.

The company has been spinning off assets to raise funds and its largest shareholder, Czech investor Radovan Vitek, said in a news agency interview in January that liquidation was a possibility. [ID:nL5N0KY2KX]
