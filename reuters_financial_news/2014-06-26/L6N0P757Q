MOSCOW, June 26 (Reuters) - Russia's second-biggest bank, VTB <VTBR.MM>, has agreed to extend $2 billion in a short-term loan to Belarus, the lender said on Thursday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last year that Russia would provide a $2 billion loan to Minsk, its staunchest ally among the former Soviet republics. [ID:nL6N0K414R] VTB's press office declined to say in an email whether this was the same loan as that approved by Putin. Belarus secured a $3 billion credit line from a Russian-led bailout fund in June 2011 to help it avoid economic chaos, stabilize its rouble currency and tame runaway inflation. The country of 9.5 million people is part of the Eurasian Economic Union, a recently established trading bloc including Russia and Kazakhstan, and is heavily reliant on proceeds from refining Russian oil.
