DUBAI, June 26 (Reuters) - Omani lender Bank Dhofar <BDOF.OM>, currently in merger talks with smaller rival Bank Sohar <BKSB.OM>, plans to raise a $75 million subordinated loan to help boost its capital reserves, the bank said in a statement on Thursday.

The loan plans, which would support the bank's Tier 2 - or supplementary - capital, have been approved by the board of directors but are still subject to legal and regulatory approval, the bourse filing said without giving further details. The second-largest bank in the sultanate by market value, Bank Dhofar had a total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 13.31 percent at the end of March, down from 14.26 percent at the same point of 2013, according to its financial statement.
