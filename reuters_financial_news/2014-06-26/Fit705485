June 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned final ratings and Outlooks to  Firstmac Mortgage Funding Trust No. 4 Series 1A-2014's mortgage-backed  floating-rate notes. The issuance consists of notes backed by Australian prime  residential mortgages originated by Firstmac nominee originators. The ratings  are as follows:  AUD340.00m Class A-1 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable USD 270.00m Class A-2A notes: 'F1+sf' AUD0.00m Class A-2R notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD37.50m Class A-3 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD45.75m Class AB notes: NR AUD22.50m Class B-1 notes: NR AUD3.75m Class B-2 notes: NR AUD3.0m Class B-3 notes: NR  The notes, due September 2045, have been issued by Firstmac Fiduciary Services  Pty Ltd in its capacity as trustee of Firstmac Mortgage Funding Trust No. 4  Series 1A-2014.  At the cut-off date, 30 April 2014, the total collateral pool consisted of 3,291  loans to 2,537 borrowers totaling approximately AUD744.1m.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  Key Pool Characteristics: The weighted-average (WA) seasoning of the portfolio  is 26.5 months with an average current loan/value ratio (LVR) of 67.0% (indexed  LVR is 64.4%). The transaction has a proportion of loans that are interest only  (44.5%), and investment loans make up 37.9% of the pool by balance. Lenders'  mortgage insurance (LMI) is present on 62.0% of the pool, which differs from  prior Firstmac RMBS transactions where all loans had LMI present. Short-Term Note: The transaction includes a US dollar short-term bullet note  (class A-2A) that will be refinanced via the issuance of class A-2B short-term  notes in either Australian or US dollars. If refinancing is not available for  the class A-2A notes or the class A-2B notes, then either class of notes will be  refinanced from a combination of funds collected in a deposit account and a  redemption facility provided by National Australia Bank Limited <NAB.AX> (NAB,  AA-/Stable/F1+), creating a rating link to NAB. Excess Spread Trap: The transaction benefits from a spread reserve account  funded by excess income that is available to cover both liquidity shortfalls and  losses. Stable Performance to Date: Firstmac's loan book is currently revealing 30+ days  arrears of 0.8% as of March 2014. This is below Fitch's current Dinkum Index of  1.2% for prime RMBS arrears. Firstmac's arrears have tracked at or below the  Dinkum Index for prime RMBS in recent years.   RATING SENSITIVITY  Unexpected decreases in residential property values, increases in the frequency  of foreclosures, and loss severity on defaulted mortgages could produce loss  levels higher than Fitch's base case, which could in turn result in potentially  negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the sensitivity of the  ratings assigned to Firstmac Mortgage Funding Trust No. 4 Series 1A-2014 to  increased defaults and decreased recovery rates over the life of the  transaction.  The analysis found that the Class A-1, A-2A, A-2R and A-3 notes' ratings  remained stable under each of Fitch's medium and severe default and recovery  scenarios (15% or 30% increase in defaults and 15% or 30% decrease in recovery  rates). In a medium combined stress scenario, ratings also remained stable,  while under a severe combined stress scenario, Class A-1 and A-2R notes' ratings  were negatively impacted by one notch to 'AA+sf' and Class A-3 notes' ratings  were negatively impacted by two notches to AAsf .
