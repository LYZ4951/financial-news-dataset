NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - A top official in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan who oversaw a number of high-profile insider trading cases is expected to join law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

Lorin Reisner, chief of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, oversaw prosecutions that led to convictions of Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs director, and Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg, former portfolio managers at SAC Capital Advisors. Reisner did not respond to several requests for comment. A Paul Weiss spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. It is unclear when Reisner is expected to join Paul Weiss, but one of the sources, a lawyer familiar with the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Reiss is on the verge of accepting an offer from the firm.  The 775-lawyer Paul Weiss is well known for its corporate, litigation and investigations practices. It has represented SAC Capital Advisors amid insider trading charges last year, and its other clients have included Apollo, Bank of America and Citigroup, according to its website.  The other three sources said they heard from people who worked closely with Reisner that he would be joining the New York-based firm.  "It was presented as a matter of fact, not likelihood," one source said.  Reisner was appointed to his position in the U.S. Attorney's Office in January 2012 after being the deputy director of the enforcement division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He began that role in 2009, and before that was a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, where many legal industry observers assumed he may rejoin.
