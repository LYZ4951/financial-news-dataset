HANOI, June 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam received an estimated $5.75 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) during the first six months of 2014, up 0.9 percent from a year ago, a government agency said.

Competing with new frontier markets such as Myanmar and Cambodia, Vietnam received $11.5 billion in FDI in 2013, close to the $11.7 billion poured into Malaysia, one of the top five host countries in East and Southeast Asia, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
