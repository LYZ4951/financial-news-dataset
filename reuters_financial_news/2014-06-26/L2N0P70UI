NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Raymond James & Associates, the branch-based arm of the parent brokerage firm Raymond James Financial <RJF.N>, hired two financial advisers away from Sterne, Agee & Leach to join its San Francisco office, a Raymond James spokeswoman said on Thursday.

A father and son team, Stephen and Justin Adams managed more than $200 million in client assets and produced $1.1 million in revenue in the last 12 months at Sterne Agee.  The Adams started at Raymond James on May 27, just a few weeks after another financial adviser, Stephen Besse, was hired at another Northern California office in Walnut Creek.  Besse joined Raymond James on May 2 from Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, where he managed $360 million in client assets and produced $1.35 million in revenue in the last year.  The new hires reflect a strategy of focused growth on the West Coast, said Northern California complex manager Nathan Clakley.  Clakley worked with Stephen and Justin Adams previously at Van Kasper & Co, the San Francisco-based investment bank Stephen Adams helped found and which Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> bought in 1999.  A spokeswoman for Sterne Agee was not immediately available to comment.
