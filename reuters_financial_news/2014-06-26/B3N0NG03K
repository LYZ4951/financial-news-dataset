BUDAPEST, June 26 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank offered commercial banks a total of 40 billion forints ($177.78 million) worth of new 3-year and 5-year interest rate swaps <NBHO> on Thursday, introducing the auction in line with an expansion of its toolkit in April.

The bank will announce the results of the auction at 1100 GMT on the same <NBHO> Reuters page. The National Bank of Hungary announced in April that it would convert its main 2-week liquidity bills into deposits from August 1, trying to push banks into buying more government debt.
