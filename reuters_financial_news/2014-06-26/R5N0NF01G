SOFIA, June 26 (Reuters) - Shares in Bulgaria's First Investment Bank <5f4.bb>, the country's third biggest lender, fell 14.1 percent on Thursday following a ruling party lawmaker's comments that another bank could be at risk of a bank run, traders said.

A run on Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> last week prompted Bulgaria's central bank to seize control of the lender, freeze its operations and start talks with shareholders about a rescue.  Shares in other Bulgarian banks were also down sharply.
