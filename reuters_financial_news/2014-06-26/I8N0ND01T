MUMBAI, June 26 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended lower on Thursday as oil explorers such as Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. <ONGC.NS> fell sharply after the government deferred a decision to hike prices of locally produced gas, while the expiry of monthly derivatives contracts also weighed on sentiment.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.99 percent lower at 25,062.67 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended down 1 percent at 7,493.20 points.
