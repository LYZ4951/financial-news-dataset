SAN FRANCISCO, June 26 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <IPO-ALIB.N> has decided to list on the New York Stock Exchange, Bloomberg cited a person with knowledge of the matter as saying on Thursday, dealing a blow to the rival Nasdaq bourse.

The company, which handles more than 80 percent of online retail transactions in the world's second-largest economy, is expected to make its debut this summer in what could be the largest U.S. tech initial public offering.
