PRAGUE, June 26 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank left in place its policy of keeping the crown currency weak, as expected, on Thursday, with markets focussed on when a return to standard policy might come.

The bank has pledged to keep the crown <EURCZK=> from firming past around 27 to the euro until at least early 2015 but has said the probability of a later exit from the policy was rising. Governor Miroslav Singer is due to comment on the central bank board's decision at a press conference at 1215 GMT.

The central bank intervened to weaken the crown currency last November to battle deflation risks.
