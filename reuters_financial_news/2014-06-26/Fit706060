June 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings views the additional layer of  financial instruments to be introduced in connection with the change in  shareholding structure of Labeyrie Fine Foods [LFFS.UL] (Labeyrie) as neutral to the  company's credit quality. Fitch assigned an Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B'  with a Stable Outlook to Labeyrie and a 'B+'/'RR3' rating to Labeyrie's EUR275m  senior secured notes on 20 March 2014. In particular, the financial transaction aimed at funding the exit of LBO France  and at ensuring shareholding parity between Lur Berri and PAI Partners (each  would hold 43% of Labeyrie, the remaining part being held by management)  involves the issuance of a certain amount of convertible bonds and  GBP-equivalent EUR90m PIK notes (the PIK Notes) by its controlling entities. The  convertible bonds and the PIK notes would be issued at NewCo level, a special  purpose entity jointly controlled by Lur Berri, PAI Partners and management. We  have analysed the terms and conditions of the PIK notes and of the convertible  bonds and have concluded that, based on Fitch's 'Treatment of Junior Corporate  Debt in Europe' dated 8 November 2013, they would not impact Fitch's evaluation  of Labeyrie's leverage metrics.
