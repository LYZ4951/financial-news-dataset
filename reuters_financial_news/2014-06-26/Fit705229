June 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Storm 2014-II B.V.'s  EUR752.2m notes final ratings, as follows: EUR150m Class A1 floating-rate notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR550m Class A2 floating-rate notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR17.1m Class B floating-rate notes: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR13.1m Class C floating-rate notes: 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable EUR14.5m Class D floating-rate notes: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable EUR7.5m Class E floating-rate notes: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable  The RMBS notes are backed by Dutch prime mortgages originated by Obvion N.V..  KEY RATING DRIVERS Concentrated Counterparty Exposure This transaction relies strongly on the creditworthiness of Rabobank [RABN.UL] (AA-/Negative/F1+'), whose role in the transaction ranges from collection  account bank, issuer account bank, cash advance facility provider to commingling  guarantor. In addition, it acts as a back-up swap counterparty.  NHG Loans The portfolio comprises 32.7% of loans that benefit from the national mortgage  guarantee scheme (Nationale Hypotheek Garantie or NHG). No reduction in  foreclosure frequency for the NHG loans was applied since historical data  provided did not show a clear pattern of lower defaults for this portion of the  portfolio. Fitch was also provided with data on historical claims, which enabled  the agency to determine a compliance ratio assumption. The agency also reviewed  the transaction without giving any credit to the NHG loans and found the ratings  on the class A notes to be identical.   Standard Portfolio Characteristics The portfolio is 52 months seasoned and consists of prime residential mortgage  loans, with a weighted average (WA) original loan-to-market-value (OLTMV) of  88.9% and a WA debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of 29.6%, both of which are typical  for Fitch-rated Dutch RMBS transactions. The purchase of further advances into  the pool is allowed after closing, subject to certain conditions.  Robust Performance Past performance of transactions in the STORM series as well as data received on  Obvion's loan book indicate good historical performance in terms of low arrears  and limited losses. Loans that are 90+ days in arrears on Obvion's mortgage book  have increased to 0.8% at end-March 2014 from 0.3% at end-September 2011. While  high relative to historical levels, arrears remain low in absolute terms.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Material increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted  receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's expectations, which in  turn may result in potential rating actions on the notes. Stressing our 'AAAsf'  assumptions by 30% for both weighted average foreclosure frequency and recovery  rate could result in a downgrade of the class A notes to 'Asf'. More detailed model implied ratings sensitivity can be found in the New Issue  report, which is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the link  above. For its ratings analysis, Fitch received a data template with all fields fully  completed.  Fitch reviewed the results of an agreed-upon procedures report (AUP) conducted  on the portfolio. The AUP contained no material errors that would affect Fitch's  ratings analysis.  To analyse credit enhancement levels, Fitch evaluated the collateral using its  default model, details of which can be found in the reports entitled 'EMEA  Residential Mortgage Loss Criteria', dated 28 May 2014, 'EMEA RMBS Criteria  Addendum - Netherlands', dated 03 June 2014, at www.fitchratings.com. The agency  assessed the transaction cash flows using default and loss severity assumptions  under various structural stresses including prepayment speeds and interest rate  scenarios. The cash flow tests showed that each class of notes could withstand  loan losses at a level corresponding to the related stress scenario without  incurring any principal loss or interest shortfall and can retire principal by  the legal final maturity. A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties & Enforcement  Mechanisms to those typical for that asset class is available by accessing the  appendix that accompanies the New Issue report (see Storm 2014-II B.V. -  Appendix, at www.fitchratings.com).
