LAGOS, June 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria sold 134.5 billion naira ($825.9 mln) in treasury bills with mixed yields on Wednesday, the central bank said on Thursday, amid lower subscription levels compared with its auction last week.

The bank sold bills with maturities ranging from 3 months to one year and received subscriptions of 314.3 billion naira for the notes. Demand at a similar auction last week stood at 404.32 billion naira. With Wednesday's issue, Africa's biggest economy has raised 440.68 billion naira ($2.7 bln) in treasury bills this month as it seeks to manage money supply in the system, curb inflation and help government plug funding gaps in its budget. It has said it will raise 936.92 billion naira ($5.76 billion) in treasury bills in the coming three months.[nL5N0OR3Z7] The bank issued 21.53 billion naira for 3 months on Wednesday at a yield of 9.95 percent, down from the 9.9 percent it fetched at a previous auction on June 18.
