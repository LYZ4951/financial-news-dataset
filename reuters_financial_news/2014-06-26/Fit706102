June 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Societe de Financement de l'Economie Francaise's [SFEFN.UL] (SFEF) bond issues' Long-term ratings at 'AA+'. The bonds are covered by a first demand guarantee granted by the French State (AA+/Stable/F1+) and are part of the French government's refinancing scheme for credit institutions established in France.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AA+' rating reflects the explicit, first demand, irrevocable and  unconditional guarantees provided by the French State to SFEF's bond issues. The  guarantee was approved by several decrees of the French Minister of Finance  spanning between October 2008 and May 2009.  The agency notes that the guarantees are specifically given to SFEF bond issues,  denominated either in EUR, in USD, in GBP, in CHF, or in JPY within the  refinancing scheme for credit institutions established in France in 2008.  The refinancing scheme, which was validated by the European Commission on 31  October 2008, initially envisioned that guarantees would be extended to bond  issues as long as they did not exceed a combined EUR265bn by end-2009. However,  on 23 September 2009, SFEF's board of directors decided not to proceed with new  issues. This decision ends SFEF's activity. Therefore, from this date, SFEF has  stopped issuing. Subsequent Caisse de Refinancement de l'Habitat [CDRHA.UL] -  CRH - (AAA)  took over SFEF's outstanding debt management, including coupon and interest  settlement, guarantees management. The total outstanding amount of SFEF's issues  guaranteed by the French State is approximately EUR8.3bn. Created in October 2008, SFEF is a private company, 66% held by seven large  French banks and 34% held by the French State. The seven banks are BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> (A+/Stable/F1); Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> (A/Stable/F1); Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> (A/Negative/F1); Groupe Caisse d'Epargne (A/Stable/F1); Banque Federative du Credit Mutuel [BFCM.UL] (A+/Stable/F1), Groupe Banque Populaire (A/Stable/F1) and HSBC France [CCFP.UL] (AA-/Stable/F1+). As such, SFEF is only a pass-through entity between the  financial markets and the credit institutions as the funds it raised were lent  to credit institutions established in France.  Fitch believes that the guarantees from the French State ensure a timely  repayment to bondholders if required. All guaranteed bonds benefit from the  guarantee for their full duration and are thus grandfathered. The guarantee  would be called as soon as SFEF realises and informs the French State that it  does not have the funds to repay bondholders on time. That would happen if a  bank did not pay interest and/or capital on funds it had borrowed from SFEF. A  safe payment notice mechanism between SFEF and credit institutions established  in France establishes that several days prior to the payment of coupons, every  credit institution is advised by SFEF of the exact amounts to be repaid. Credit  institutions are compelled to repay these funds to a special account held at the  French central bank, Banque de France [FRCB.UL], and all funds have to be provided before  the bonds mature. SFEF would inform the state if the guarantee has to be  activated, at the latest three days before the bonds mature, and the state would  provide any necessary funds to SFEF at an agreed price one day later. All funds  received from the state under its guarantee would therefore be available to  repay investors at least two days before the bonds mature. Once the guarantee  has been called and the money provided by the French State, SFEF would sell the  pledged assets originally received from the defaulting credit institution bank  and recover any money available from the defaulting credit institution bank,  although this can be done by the state itself at its request.  The state guarantee was approved within a package of measures, under an amended  budget bill on 13 October 2008, aimed at restoring confidence in the French  banking and financial system and at ensuring adequate financing for the  country's economy.
