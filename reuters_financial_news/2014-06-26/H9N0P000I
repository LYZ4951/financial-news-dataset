HONG KONG, June 26 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index had its best day in 1-1/2 months on Thursday, with investors upbeat on hopes that hikes in U.S. interest rates will be delayed after a surprisingly poor reading on the economy for the first quarter.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 1.5 percent at 23,197.83 points, its biggest daily gain since May 12. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also added 1.5 percent, bouncing back from a one-month low the previous session and having its best day since April 8.  Leading gains in Hong Kong were Macau gambling stocks, which extended a rebound after months of selling pressure triggered by regulatory curbs. Sands China <1928.HK> climbed 4 percent and Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> 3.7 percent. Lenovo Group <0992.HK> was the only decliner among Hang Seng components, down 1.0 percent after a media report said International Business Machines Corp's proposed $2.3 billion sale of its low-end server business to the Chinese PC maker is in limbo as the U.S. government investigates national security issues.
