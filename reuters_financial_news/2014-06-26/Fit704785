June 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)    Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings and Outlooks to  Triton Trust No. 2 Bond Series 2014-P's residential mortgage-backed  floating-rate notes as listed below. The ratings are as follows:

AUD106.6m Class A1 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD24.0m Class A2 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD4.0m Class B notes: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD3.0m Class C notes: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable AUD3.75m Class D notes: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable AUD3.7m Class E notes: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable AUD1.55m Class F notes: 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable AUD3.2m Class G notes: NR The notes, due December 2044, will be issued by Perpetual Corporate Trust  Limited as trustee for Triton Trust No. 2 in respect of Bond Series 2014-P. At the cut-off date, 30 April 2014, the total collateral pool consisted of 559  loans, totaling approximately AUD148.3m.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  Key Pool Characteristics: The weighted-average (WA) seasoning of the portfolio  is 95 months with an average current loan/value ratio (LVR) of 69.4% (indexed  LVR is 59.6%). The transaction has a proportion of loans that are interest only  (32.6%), and investment loans make up 51% of the pool by balance. The portfolio  is well spread geographically.  RATING SENSITIVITY  Unexpected decreases in residential property values, increases in the frequency  of foreclosures, and loss severity on defaulted mortgages could produce loss  levels higher than Fitch's base case, which could in turn result in potentially  negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the sensitivity of the  ratings to increased defaults and decreased recovery rates over the life of the  transaction. Any significant increase in defaults, losses or delinquencies and decreases in  recovery rates away from base case assumptions may result in future negative  rating actions.
