NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended June 25 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $12.3 billion to $1.055 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $7.9 billion to $1.088 trillion.
