June 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Japan-based Taiyo  Life Insurance Company's [TDHOLT.UL] (Taiyo Life) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at  'A'. The Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The IFS rating reflects the company's growing profitable protection insurance  business and its strong capitalisation. Due to its overall solid fundamentals,  Taiyo Life is increasingly important to T&D Life Group, contributing to the  group's improving financial strength. Taiyo Life's statutory solvency margin ratio (SMR) improved to 981.3% at  end-March 2014 from 823.4% a year earlier, mainly because the company has  further accumulated capital. This is lower than that of its sister company Daido  Life Insurance Company (IFS A+/Negative), but still commensurate with an 'A'  rating.  The company's financial leverage increased to 21.5% at end-March 2014 from 15.8%  a year earlier, because Taiyo Life issued dated subordinated debts of JPY50bn in  September 2013. This is high among IFS 'A' category domestic peers, but is still  considered consistent with an 'A' rating.   Taiyo Life's effective asset liability management (ALM) has resulted in its  assets and liabilities being closely matched in duration, which is exceptional  among Japanese traditional life insurers. Also, Taiyo Life's exposure to  high-risk assets remains one of the lowest among Japanese traditional life  insurers and is consistent with the company's current rating.  The company's underwriting fundamentals continue to improve due to its increased  efforts to promote protection products, which are more profitable than its other  products. The insurer's policy amount in force continued to grow, at 2.7% yoy in  the financial year ended March 2014 (FYE14), faster than that at most other  Japanese traditional life insurers.  Taiyo Life provides insurance for households, mainly for elderly women who have  been its core customers thus far.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for an upgrade include further evidence of the company  becoming more integrated within T&D Holdings, Inc. (T&D) and therefore being  considered "core" to the group according to Fitch's group rating methodology. In  particular, further growth in protection insurance and strengthened capital  adequacy within the operating entities of T&D would be regarded as potential  upgrade factors.
