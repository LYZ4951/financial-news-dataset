June 26 (Reuters) - Private-label food retailer TreeHouse Foods Inc <THS.N> is in late-stage talks to acquire Flagstone Foods, a maker of dried fruits and nuts, for between $800 million and $900 million, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Oakbrook, Illinois-based TreeHouse Foods has prevailed over Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital Co at the final stage of the auction for Flagstone, which is owned by San Francisco-based private equity firm Gryphon Investors, the people said.  The people cautioned that negotiations had not yet been finalized and asked not to be identified because the talks are private.  Representatives for Flagstone Foods, Gryphon, TreeHouse and Hony Capital could not be immediately reached for comment. TreeHouse, which has a market value of $2.9 billion, said earlier this year it was looking at expanding its non-branded food business.  TreeHouse explored buying egg and dairy producer Michael Foods earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Cereal maker Post Holdings Inc <POST.N> clinched a deal to buy Michael Foods in April for $2.45 billion.

Post Holdings, for example, has recently bought a number of companies that help consumers lead healthy lifestyles, including protein bar makers Dymatize and PowerBar.
