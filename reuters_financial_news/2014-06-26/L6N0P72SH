LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index steadied by midday trading on Thursday as a rally in housebuilders following comments from the Bank of England was offset by a fall in major banks such as Barclays and Standard Chartered.

Land Securities <LSE.L>, Persimmon <PSN.L> and Barratt Developments <BDEV.L> rose 4.1 to 6.3 percent after BoE governor Mark Carney announced a cap on home loans and tougher checks, but said the central bank did not aim to curb house prices directly. [ID:nS8N0P000S]  "Carney's comments are generally being perceived as less stringent and more dovish than investors had expected," James Butterfill, global equity strategist at Coutts, said. "Measures such as direct controls to curb lending growth were not addressed and consequently homebuilders, which had been pricing more stringent measures, are rallying." Gains in housebuilders were counterbalanced by a sharp decline in shares of some major banks. The blue-chip FTSe 100 index <.FTSE> was flat at 6,731.23 points by 1124 GMT. Standard Chartered <STAN.L> slipped 4.3 percent after issuing a profit warning, while Barclays <BARC.L> slumped 5.1 percent after the New York Attorney General filed a securities fraud lawsuit against the bank on charges of giving an unfair edge to its U.S. high-frequency trading clients. [ID:nL2N0P61T3][ID:nL6N0P727I] Barclays shares have fallen around 20 percent since the start of 2014, underperforming the FTSE 100 <.FTSE> - which is flat since the start of 2014 - and a rise of around 1 percent on the STOXX Europe 600 Bank Index <.SX7P>. "The judicial context is becoming a real drag for the European banking sector. There are fears among investors of a contagion effect from the U.S. investigations. After BNP, Barclays, who will be next?," said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG France. The fall in Barclays shares wiped out about 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from the bank's total market capitalisation. However, investors remained positive on the broader market's outlook.
