PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trade on Thursday, rebounding from the previous session's sell-off and tracking gains on Wall Street, while Barclays <BARC.L> fell after The New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the bank.

At 0704 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,374.27 points, bouncing back from a one-month low hit on Wednesday following weak U.S. growth data. Shares in Barclays were down 3.2 percent. The New York Attorney General filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Barclays for giving an unfair edge to its U.S. high-frequency trading clients even as it claimed to be protecting other customers from the traders.
