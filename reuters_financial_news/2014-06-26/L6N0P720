LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - Standard Chartered <STAN.L> said the head of its financial markets, Lenny Feder, was unlikely to take the same role when he returns from a sabbatical in a year's time.

The Asia-focused bank said on Thursday Feder will take a 12-month sabbatical from the bank, starting on July 19, and it had started a search for a permanent replacement. [ID:nFWN0OZ02]
