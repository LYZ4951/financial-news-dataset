PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - Airbus <AIR.PA> is very close to a decision to upgrade its A330 with engines provided by Rolls-Royce <RR.L>, setting the stage for a bitter new phase in the battle for wide-body jet orders with Boeing's 787, people familiar with the matter said.

The move will strengthen a growing strategic pairing between the European companies, with General Electric <GE.N>, the main alternative engine supplier on the existing version of the jet, no longer seen as a contender to take part in the $2 billion project to build a revamped "A330neo", they said. The people, asking not to be named, said the move to go ahead with Rolls-Royce as the only supplier for a new version of the A330, offering up to 14-15 percent in fuel savings including new wingtips, is subject to approval by the Airbus Group board. Rolls-Royce <RR.L> said it was "not aware" of a final decision having been reached. GE <GE.N> declined to comment on the commercial talks, which have been going on for some months.
