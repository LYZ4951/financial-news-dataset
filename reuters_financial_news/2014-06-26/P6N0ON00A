LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - Shares in British bank Barclays <BARC.L> were seen opening down by 2-3 percent on Thursday, according to pre-market indications from traders, after the New York Attorney General filed a securities fraud lawsuit against the lender.

On Wednesday, the New York Attorney General filed the lawsuit against Barclays for giving an unfair edge to its U.S. high-frequency trading clients even as it claimed to be protecting other customers from the traders. [ID:nL2N0P61T3] In an emailed statement, Barclays said: "We take these allegations very seriously." It added that it is cooperating with authorities, is looking at the matter internally, and that the integrity of markets is a top priority for the bank.
