PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - French electronic payment and transaction services provider Worldline <WLN.PA> set a price for its initial public offering at the bottom of its previously indicated price range, giving it a market value of around 2.16 billion euros ($2.94 billion).

The company said it would raise about 575 million euros through the IPO, or up to 661 million if it fully exercises an overallotment option, based on the price of 16.4 euros. Parent Atos <ATOS.PA> is selling shares worth around 320 million euros as part of the stock market listing, or up to as much as 406 million, in which case Atos would retain a 69.42 percent stake in Wordline.
