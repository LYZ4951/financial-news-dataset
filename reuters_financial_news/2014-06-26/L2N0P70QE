WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Thursday it had started publishing a new report to measure the risk each of a group of 33 large banks poses to the overall financial system.

The data gauges a bank's size, its interconnectedness, complexity, and other measures of the so-called systemic risk of each of the banks in the group, the Fed said.
