June 26 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets gained on Thursday, in line with the other regional markets on expectations the U.S. would delay raising interest rates after weak first-quarter growth in the world's largest economy.

The U.S. economy contracted at a much steeper pace in the first quarter than previously estimated, turning in one of its worst-ever non-recession performances, but growth already appears to have rebounded strongly. [ID:nL2N0P60H3] Thailand's SET index <.SETI> hit an eight-month intraday high of 1477.62 in the early trade. It was up 0.5 percent at 1476.08 by midday, led by energy shares with the country's top oil firm PTT PCL <PTT.BK> gaining 2.3 percent. The Bangkok market has been waiting for direction from the policy discussion on Thai energy reforms, scheduled to be announced by the end of this month. Malaysia <.KLSE> bucked the trend, but palm oil producer Boustead Plantations Bhd <BOPL.KL> rose 4 percent on the first day of trade after it raised 1.05 billion ringgit ($325 million) in its initial public offering. [ID:nL4N0P11VN]  In Jakarta, banks led the gains with a 1.9 percent rise in Bank Central Asia Tbk PT <BBCA.JK> and 1 percent rise in Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK>. However, analysts expect the Jakarta Composite Index to move sideways due to political uncertainty ahead of presidential polls scheduled on July 9. For Asian companies click [ID:nTOPEQA]
