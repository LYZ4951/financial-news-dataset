NICOSIA, June 26 (Reuters) - Cypriot lender Bank of Cyprus <BOC.CY> concluded a board meeting on Thursday where capital issues were discussed, a bank spokesman said.

He said an announcement on the matter would be issued on Friday morning. No further details were immediately available. The Cypriot lender was forced to convert a large portion of client deposits to equity last year when international lenders refused to shore up the bank, Cyprus's largest.
