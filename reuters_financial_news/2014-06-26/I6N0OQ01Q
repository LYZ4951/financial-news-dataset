MILAN, June 26 (Reuters) - Italian real estate management fund Beni Stabili <BNSI.MI> said on Thursday its board had approved a plan for a 150 million-euro ($204 million) capital increase and new bank loans for around 500 million euros to boost its financial structure.

The money will be used to repay in advance a loan related to a property portfolio leased to Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI> and is expected to boost its recurring net profit by 30 million euros on an annualised basis, it said.
