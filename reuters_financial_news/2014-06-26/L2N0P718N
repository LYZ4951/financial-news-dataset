NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon on Thursday said it is investigating whether or not it has received a deposit from the Argentine government intended for creditors, which if sent on to investors would put it in violation of a U.S. judge's orders.

"No immediate comment," a BNY Mellon spokesperson told Reuters in response to Argentina's Economy Minister Axel Kicillof saying on Thursday the government deposited the cash before a regularly scheduled coupon payment was due on June 30. [ID:nL2N0P710U] The bank is the largest custody bank in the world. It acts as a transfer agent for bondholders who participated in two prior restructurings stemming from Argentina's 2001-2002 sovereign default and is specifically barred from delivering the payments by a U.S. court order unless certain conditions are met.
