WELLINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand insurance company Tower Ltd <TWR.NZ> on Friday said it posted a 70 percent fall in half-year profit due to a rise in claims due to severe weather events, while its income has been cut following recent divestments.

In a report re-released to the New Zealand Stock Exchange, the company confirmed that profit after tax was NZ$13.1 million ($11.35 million) in the six months to March 31, compared with NZ$44.2 million in the same period last year. [ID:nW9N0IO00V]
