STOCKHOLM, June 26 (Reuters) - Swedish defense firm Saab <SAABb.ST> on Thursday confirmed a media report it was nearing a deal to buy German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp's <TKAG.DE> submarine shipyard in the south of Sweden.

The Stockholm bourse briefly halted trading in Saab shares on Thursday following a report by business daily Dagens Industri that Saab may soon announce such a deal, with a price tag well below 1 billion crowns ($148.4 million). The paper did not provide sources. [ID:nL6N0P7178] Saab and ThyssenKrupp announced in April they were in talks for ThyssenKrupp to sell the unit to Saab after the German group failed to reach a deal with Sweden for a new generation of submarines.[ID:nL6N0N62P4] "The discussions are at a final stage but still ongoing," Saab said in a statement. "Saab has chosen to clarify the status of these discussions due to information published in the media."
