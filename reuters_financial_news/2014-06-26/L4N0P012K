SYDNEY, June 26 (Reuters) - Australia's benchmark share index will end 2014 at a six-year high as a sustained pick-up in domestic housing, a falling Australian dollar and a return to global growth buoy appetites for local equities, a Reuters poll showed.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> is forecast to be 5,700 points, according to the median in a poll of 13 analysts taken in the past week. Such a level, not seen since mid-2008, would be a 5.5 percent gain on the market's June 25 close and a 6.5 percent rise for the year.  "I think going through to the next year it will be clear the Australian economy is rebalancing and picking up pace on a sustained basis," said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors.  However, the fresh year-end forecast is 100 points lower than given in a March poll. In the new poll, estimates ranged from as low as 5,300 to a high of 6,000. The benchmark hit a near six-year high of 5,554.5 points on April 29 but has since drifted lower as a rout in iron ore prices, geopolitical tension in Ukraine and unrest in Iraq have hit investor sentiment. Some worry that negativity is set to continue. "I think valuations are stretched, so I think it's going to be hard for the market to continue to rally like this," said Matthew Sherwood, head of investments research at Perpetual and the most bearish respondent, forecasting a fall to 5,300 by the end of the year and to 5,200 by mid-2015. "When the Fed (U.S. Federal Reserve) starts tightening rates, you might see an unwinding in some of the valuation premiums," he said. Many analysts, including Credit Suisse, Lonsec and Commonwealth Securities, expect underperformance in the bluechip mining sector, anticipating profit downgrades as a result of the fall in commodity prices.  In the banking space, some analysts said there was value in the banks' high dividend yields, though others were wary. Stocks with offshore exposure, particularly to the United States, were singled out for growth, as repatriated earnings could boost companies' bottom lines if the Aussie dollar moves still lower. "Our focus is very much on global cyclicals, the Australian companies that have key specific offshore businesses - so Amcor <AMC.AX>, James Hardie <JHX.N>, CSL <CSL.AX>, those sorts of companies," said Martin Lakos, private wealth adviser at Macquarie Bank.  Nine analysts gave forecasts for mid-2015, with a median view of 5,900 points. Predictions ranged from 5,200 to 6,300.  "There's going to be hiccups along the way," said Chris Weston, institutional dealer at IG. "I think global growth should resonate into organic earnings growth rather than purely stimulus issues that have helped expand price-earnings ratios."
