FRANKFURT, June 26 (Reuters) - Germany's third-biggest insurer Talanx <TLXGn.DE> expects to make a net profit of about 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) in 2017 thanks to a rapid expansion of its international business, the company said in an investor presentation on Thursday.

This year, the company expects profit to fall from the 762 million euros it earned in 2013 when low taxes and proceeds from a share sale helped it beat analyst forecasts. [ID:nL5N0ML0ZN] It still expects net profit of at least 700 million euros in 2014.
