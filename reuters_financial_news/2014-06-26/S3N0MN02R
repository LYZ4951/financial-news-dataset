STOCKHOLM, June 26 (Reuters) - Swedish investment firm Kinnevik <KINVb.ST> is not actively trying to sell telecom operator Tele2 <TEL2b.ST>, its chief executive was reported as saying on Thursday.

His comments to Swedish news agency Direkt follow media reports this year that Hong Kong's Hutchison <0013.HK>, which in Sweden co-owns telecom operator 3 with Investor AB <INVEb.ST>, might buy it. Asked if Tele2 was on its sell list, Kinnevik CEO Lorenzo Grabau said: "Absolutely not. Tele2 is well positioned and has strong brands in its markets."
