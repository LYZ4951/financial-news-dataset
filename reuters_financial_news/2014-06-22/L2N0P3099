WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - The newly elected No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives said on Sunday he opposed renewing the charter for the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which helps finance exports of U.S. goods and services.

Representative Kevin McCarthy, the incoming House majority leader, told "Fox News Sunday" the bank's role should be taken over by the private sector. Asked if he would allow the bank's charter to expire at the end of September, McCarthy said: "Yes, because it's something that the private sector can be able to do." The Export-Import Bank, which was established 80 years ago, backed $37.4 billion in exports in 2013. Scrapping the bank would be a blow to Boeing <BA.N>, Caterpillar <CAT.N>, General Electric <GE.N> and other U.S. companies that rely on Ex-Im financing to make sales in export markets where commercial lending is scarce. Representative Eric Cantor, who steps down as majority leader on July 31 after losing a primary election this month, was a major supporter of the bank and helped get its charter renewed on 2012 in the face of conservative opposition.  Last month, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, called on fellow Republicans to oppose renewing the charter. He said the bank helps some companies at the expense of others.
