MADRID, July 5 (Reuters) - Spanish wireless network provider Gowex <GOW.MC> said it had hired accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) [PWC.UL] to carry out an audit of the company after a report from a firm called Gotham City Research LLC questioned its revenue reporting.

Trading in Gowex shares was suspended on Thursday after they dropped by about 60 percent in two days, wiping about 870 million euros ($1.2 billion) off the company's stock market value, in the wake of the Gotham report. [ID:nL6N0PC3WJ] Spain's stock market regulator has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to provide information about Gotham in order to analyse whether the publication of its report could constitute market abuse. Gowex, which had said it would present an action plan by Monday in relation to the Gotham report, said PwC would look at the accounting, financial, contractual and management information as of Dec. 31, 2013 and produce a report by Aug. 31.
