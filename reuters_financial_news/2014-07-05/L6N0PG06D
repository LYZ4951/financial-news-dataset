WARSAW, July 5 (Reuters) - Polish retail group Emperia Holding plans to spin off and list its real-estate arm, with the decoupling expected to finish at the turn of 2014 and 2015, the firm's chief executive was quoted as saying on Saturday.

"We are conducting the separation so that the two companies will be listed independently of each other," Dariusz Kalinowski told Parkiet daily. "Shareholders of Emperia will be at the same time shareholders of the development firm."
