FRANKFURT, March 20 (Reuters) - Bilfinger <GBFG.DE> has around 800 million euros ($1.11 billion) left in its war chest for acquisitions, but has no plans to make any 'big bang' deals, the company said on Thursday.

Chief Executive Roland Koch told reporters that the sum is available for acquisitions in the next two years.  Over the past two years, the engineering and services company has spent about 800 million euros to acquire about two dozens companies.
