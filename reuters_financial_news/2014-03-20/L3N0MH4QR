SYDNEY, March 21 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open higher on Friday, rebounding from a 1.1 percent loss posted a day earlier and tracking Wall Street gains after the U.S. posted better-than-expected factory activity and jobless data.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.4 percent to 5,318, an 24-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark fell 1.1 percent on Thursday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was flat at 5,157.9 in early trade. * Wall Street stocks rose on Thursday, after a batch of economic data pointed to an improving economy and investors reassessed Fed Chair Janet Yellen's comments that had fueled speculation of an earlier-than-expected rate hike by the U.S. central bank. * Copper prices slid on Thursday, giving up the previous day's gains, as investors worried about the prospect of U.S. interest rates increasing earlier than expected and about a credit squeeze in top consumer China. * Gold prices were little changed on Thursday, helped by bargain hunting after the metal's sharp drop the previous day on comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that suggested U.S. interest rates could rise sooner than expected. * Roy Hill said on Friday it had secured $7.2 billion in debt for the Roy Hill iron ore mining project, completing all the funding for the giant mine in Western Australia due to start producing in late 2015. [ID:nL3N0MH4KN] The 55-million-tonnes a year mine will make Roy Hill Australia's fifth largest iron ore producer, adding to a slew of new supply from bigger rivals Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> <RIO.L>, BHP Billiton <BHP.AX> <BLT.L> and Fortescue Metals Group <FMG.AX>. * Zimbabwe is considering a proposal for the construction of a platinum refinery from Impala Platinum <IMPJ.J>, the world's No. 2 producer of the precious metal, the country's mines minister said on Thursday. [ID:nL6N0MH22Y] The news may put platinum miner Implats' Zimbabwean unit Zimplats <ZIM.AX> in focus. * The Australian government's efforts to scrap the country's carbon tax were defeated in a Senate vote on Thursday, though the bill is likely to return after July when more Liberal senators take their seats.
