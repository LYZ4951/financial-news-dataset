MUMBAI, March 20 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India will conduct a repurchase of government bonds worth 50 billion rupees ($819.60 million) through a reverse auction on March 24, it said on Thursday.

The central bank will repurchase bonds via reverse auction to prematurely redeem the bonds by utilising the government's surplus cash balances, it said.
