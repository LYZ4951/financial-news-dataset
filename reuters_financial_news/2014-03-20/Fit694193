March 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Proposals announced in yesterday's UK Budget to allow pension savings to be taken as cash are negative for annuity providers, Fitch Ratings says. But they would probably not lead to rating downgrades, as the annuity providers we rate are large groups with a diverse product mix, rather than specialist annuity providers. If implemented, we believe this change would significantly reduce the  GBP15bn-a-year UK annuity market, as many savers would choose to access their  pensions as cash or via drawdown products in preference to an annuity,  particularly while annuity rates remain low. Annuities are a large and  relatively profitable business for many life insurance companies, so any  significant shrinking of the annuity market would be negative for their  operating scale and earnings. Although some insurers would stand to lose future annuity business, companies  offering alternative products for pensioners to manage and access their pensions  would benefit. But we believe these products would typically generate lower  profits than annuities, which can generate relatively high profits as  compensation for the uncertainty about how long pensioners receiving the annuity  will live. The proposed changes would therefore be negative for the  profitability of the UK life sector as a whole, although there would be  individual winners and losers. Some of the main annuity providers are large insurance groups with diverse  businesses, and could therefore absorb the negative effects of the proposed  reforms. Prudential, for example, is a global group with large operations in  Asia and the US, and large with-profits and asset-management businesses in  addition to its UK annuity business. Aviva has a wide range of life and non-life  insurance products in the UK and several European markets, and Legal & General  has a broad range of insurance and investment products in the UK in addition to  its annuity business.
