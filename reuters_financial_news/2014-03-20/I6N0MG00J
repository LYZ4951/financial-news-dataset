MILAN, March 20 (Reuters) - Salini Impregilo <SALI.MI> said it aimed to more than double its  core profit and boost its margin on sales by 2017 as Italy's biggest builder unveiled its targets under a new strategy plan.

In a statement, Salini Impregilo, which was formed in January following a merger, said earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) should rise to around 500 million euros ($696 million) in 2017 from a proforma of 234 million euros in 2013. Over the life of the plan the company expects annual orders of more than 7 billion euros, down from 8.6 billion euros in 2013. Its net financial position should turn positive at around 500 million euros at end-2017 compared to a net debt of 332 million euros at end-2013.
