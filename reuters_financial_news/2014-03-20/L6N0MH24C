MUNICH, March 20 (Reuters) - Munich Re <MUVGn.DE> does not expect a major hit from damage claims linked to a Malaysia Airlines <MASM.KL> jet that went missing 12 days ago with 239 people on board, it said on Thursday.

The world's largest reinsurer also has no forecast as yet for the size of the claim that the insurance industry is likely to pay but the figure of $500 million reported in some media was clearly too high, Munich Re board member Torsten Jeworrek told a news conference. The damage claim for the plane itself is around $100 million, but insurers have been reluctant to speculate about the size of other claims linked to the case.
