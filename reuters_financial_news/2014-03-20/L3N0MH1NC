SEOUL, March 20 (Reuters) - South Korea's inspection of Barclays PLC's <BARC.L> local unit was a routine, scheduled one and has nothing to do with the units of the three Chinese banks also under inspection, a central bank official said on Thursday.

"The inspection of the Barclays unit is being made according to a routine inspection schedule on foreign banks," said Cho Jeong-hwan, director of the Bank of Korea's Office of Bank Examination and Analysis.
