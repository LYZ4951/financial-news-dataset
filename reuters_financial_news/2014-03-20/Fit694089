March 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to rate Financiere Gaillon 8 (FG8) at Long term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'B(EXP)' with Stable Outlook and its EUR370m senior unsecured notes at 'B-(EXP)', with a Recovery Rating of 'RR5'. FG8 is a holding company with its sole asset an 88% stake in KBSA, one of the  largest house builders in France with a solid operating track record. Although  Fitch expects KBSA - at the operating company level - to be moderately leveraged  at around 2.0x funds from operations (FFO) gross leverage the proposed EUR370m  notes that refinance existing acquisition debt at FG8 maintain an aggressive  capital structure.  The ratings reflect a high consolidated FFO gross leverage of around 6.2x with a  modest de-leveraging profile. The proposed transaction combines a five-year  refinancing of KBSA's prior ranking bank facilities, ensuring solid liquidity  and adequate debt service cover for note holders. However, refinancing risk  remains high given its thin equity cushion and the inherently cyclical operating  risk profile of a house builder. However, KBSA is well-positioned among  competitors and has a prudent approach to house building, having efficiently  managed down working capital requirements through cycles.  The expected IDR fully consolidates KBSA based on Fitch's parent-subsidiary  linkage criteria, given their close operational and strategic ties. Control of  KBSA and the structuring of the proposed refinancing indicate a strong intention  to use KBSA cash flow to service the proposed EUR370m notes. The proposed notes  do not benefit from a KBSA guarantee, although note holders benefit from a  pledge on KBSA shares. The notes are contractually and structurally subordinated  to KBSA's EUR150m prior ranking senior credit facilities resulting in weaker  recovery expectations and Fitch assigning a 'B-'/(RR5) instrument rating for the  EUR370m notes. The ratings are pending the completion of the notes issue and refinancing of  KBSA's bank loans. Failure to complete the refinancing according to plan would  result in the withdrawal of the ratings. Final instrument rating will be  contingent upon the receipt of final documentation conforming materially to  information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Modest De-leveraging Profile De-leveraging is expected with FFO gross leverage trending below 6.0x over the  next three years. Fitch's rating case estimates single-digit housing volume  increases with stable operating margins and a mild increase in working capital  requirements, resulting in overall yearly free cash flow.   Lacklustre French Market Recovery Through-the-cycle the French housing market has shown less volatility than other  European markets in both volume and price. Following a recovery in 2010 and 2011  driven by favourable tax regimes and low mortgage rates, 2013 marked a low point  in volumes of new houses and a slow recovery is expected for 2014 onwards.   Low Margin Volatility KBSA has below-average margins than other European house builders, although this  is a function of a lower-risk house building business model. KBSA has a current  policy of maintaining pre-sales rates above 60%, limiting downside price risk  with the addition of improved working capital. Higher pre-sales ensure higher  customer stage payments by the time large cash outflows are required for land  acquisition. In France house builders such as KBSA use land options rather than  outright acquisition of land bank. These options are typically only exercised if  planning permission and a high pre-sales rate are obtained.   Fairly Low Working Capital Land options limit development and volume risk, allowing KBSA to cancel a  project with minimal cash outflows. KBSA has one of the lowest working capital  requirements in the sector with a working capital/turnover ratio averaging 16%  over the last four years. However, during 2007 and 2008 this ratio reached 32%,  primarily driven by a lower pre-sales rate of around 30% meaning lower customer  payments funding working capital requirements.   Maintaining Financial Discipline KBSA management have a track record of maintaining high pre-sale rates. Under a  growth scenario with strong house price inflation the trade-off between  profitability and pre-sales becomes more evident. Increased margins can be  achieved in a rising price environment by lowering pre-sale rates, albeit at the  increased risk of exposing more working capital to a potential downturn. Any  reversal of KBSA risk management's policies would be viewed as a  rating-negative.  Modest Diversification KBSA is primarily focused on apartments across France, albeit skewed towards the  Paris suburbs. Over the last decade it has remained a top five player with a  stable market share of around 6%. The customer base is diversified across three  broad groups, including institutional investors, individual investors (second  home) and owner-occupiers (primary residence), limiting dependence on any one  group. However, KBSA remains a price taker and volumes are inherently linked to  the French housing market although structural under-supply provides long- term  support.  Solid Liquidity; Bullet Risk The proposed transaction provides a refinancing package for both FG8 and KBSA  with no material debt maturities over the next five years. Liquidity is  satisfactory with a high level of cash on balance sheet providing a cushion  against seasonal working capital requirements that can be as high as EUR150m  throughout the year. As a result KBSA has typically had a FFO net leverage  significantly lower than gross leverage. A further working capital facility of  EUR50m provides additional liquidity. The high FFO gross leverage of around 6.2x  and a modest de-leveraging profile, combined with the bullet maturity, leave  refinancing risk at FG8 a key rating weakness with the likely source of  repayment from trade sales or IPO proceeds of KBSA.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating action include: - Decrease in FFO gross adjusted leverage to below 5.0x and FFO interest cover  above 2.5x on a sustained basis - On-going prudent development with pre-sale rates above 50% and working  capital/turnover ratio below 20%. - Dividend cover (KBSA FCF/dividend up-streamed to FG8) above 2.0x on a  sustained basis and sufficient maintenance of distributable legal reserves at  KBSA
