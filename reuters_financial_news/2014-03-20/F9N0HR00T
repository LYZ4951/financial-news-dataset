DUESSELDORF, Germany, March 20 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank welcomes a deal struck by European policymakers to complete a banking union, ECB Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said on Thursday.

European policymakers agreed on Thursday after all-night talks on a compromise for a mechanism to close down failing euro zone banks, the second part of the so-called banking union that also includes centralised banking supervision at the ECB.  "This is major progress," Lautenschlaeger, who is also the vice chair of the new banking watchdog, told reporters. "Decision-making structures have been streamlined somewhat. I'm happy that a compromise has been struck. One can live with that... All in all, this is positive." Banking union, Europe's answer to the financial crisis, aims to make the financial sector more resilient and cut the link between struggling banks and indebted governments to shield taxpayers from having to foot the bill in future.
