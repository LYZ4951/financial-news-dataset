LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine dollar bonds rose between 1 and 2 cents across the maturity curve on Thursday on speculation that the International Monetary Fund was preparing a statement on Ukraine.

"Market rallying, on rumours of an IMF statement in the offing," Tim Ash, emerging markets strategist at Standard Bank, said in a client note. An International Monetary Fund mission has been visiting Kiev which says it needs around $35 billion in aid. The fund mission is due to be completed on Friday. [ID:nL2N0MA0ZD]
