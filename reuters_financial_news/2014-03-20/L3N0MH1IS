COLOMBO, March 20 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's central bank is expected to keep its key policy rates steady on Friday, a Reuters poll showed, after slashing them to multi-year lows to boost the island nation's faltering economic growth.

The central bank has cut the repurchase rate by 125 basis points (bps) and reverse repurchase rate by 175 bps since December 2012 to stimulate economic growth, which picked up to 7.3 percent last year from 6.3 percent in the previous year.  The central bank has estimated the $67 billion economy would grow 7.8 percent this year.  Following are the poll's forecasts for where rates will be after Friday's announcement:   Repo Reverse repoSRR
