WARSAW, March 20 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank may still raise interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 depending on the pace of economic recovery and inflation, policymaker Andrzej Bratkowski was quoted as saying on Thursday.

"I would like the cycle to begin early and proceed at a very slow pace of 0.25 percentage-point increases every two, three months," Andrzej Bratkowski told the online version of the Wall Street Journal.
