March 20 (Reuters) - Gabriel Plotkin, one of SAC Capital Advisors' most successful portfolio managers, is leaving the firm by year's end to start his own hedge fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

SAC founder Steven A. Cohen is likely to put some capital in Plotkin's new venture, said the source who was not permitted to publicly discuss personnel matters at the private fund.
