BUDAPEST, March 20 (Reuters) - Investors in Hungary can expect more unpredictable and, for some, hostile policies if Prime Minister Viktor Orban wins next month's election, according to a Reuters poll and sources with knowledge of his intentions.

Orban has used his strong political mandate since 2010 to nationalise pension funds and hike taxes on banks and sectors such as energy and telecoms where foreigners are dominant. Such policies have stabilised public finances but alienated many investors.  If Orban is re-elected in the parliamentary election on April 6, he will pursue strategies such as increasing state control over energy utilities and cutting personal income taxes further, according to analysts polled by Reuters and sources who did not want to be identified. However, some of those interviewed think that in the later part of Orban's next term, there could be an easing of the measures that have hurt some sectors, especially foreign banks, and a softening of approach towards service sector investments. "The fundamental course of economic policy is not expected to change," a source close to the government told Reuters. "Where we could see a change is that some of those wounds made (in the past four years) could start to be treated more openly," the source added. In a Reuters poll of 21 analysts conducted between Feb. 25 and March 4, most expected increased state intervention in the economy and new measures that could deter foreign direct investment.

It is not yet clear if it will retain the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution. On Wednesday, Orban told businessmen that his government would press on with its past economic policy approach if re-elected for another four-year term.[ID:nB3N0JW01U]  "LESS HECTIC" Gergely Gulyas, a Fidesz MP, told journalists this month that the legislative agenda under a renewed mandate would be "less hectic". Orban is expected to stick to efforts to rebuild public finances that freed Hungary from EU disciplinary measures. But analysts expect new rows with Brussels after four years of conflict over changes to the constitution and to media laws. They see Orban pursuing efforts to reduce foreign stakes in energy utilities, instead putting more of the sector into state hands in the belief that cheap energy will be key to long-term economic success. Under pressure from deep cuts, mandated by the government, in electricity and gas prices for households, some foreign firms have already decided to sell their public utility units in Hungary. More could follow.  Foreign banks, among the biggest losers from Orban's policies, are likely to foot some of the bill for more measures to help Hungarians who borrowed in foreign currencies when exchange rates were more favourable. Nine of 17 analysts who answered poll questions on the forint predicted policies intended to weaken it, and none saw policies to strengthen it. A sharply weaker forint would increase the risk of a sell-off in government bonds too, especially at times of turbulence on emerging markets. <EURHUF=> Central bank governor Gyorgy Matolcsy, a close ally of Orban, said in December that four of eight big foreign banks could leave Hungary in the near term. So far, all the big banks have declared they wanted to stay. But according to a diplomatic source, Orban told ambassadors in December that much would depend on how the banks fared in EU-wide stress tests.   "LESS HECTIC" However, one source close to the government said Orban knows he needs to make growth sustainable. That means banks in particular may get a reprieve. At the December meeting with ambassadors, said one diplomatic source, Orban said something would have to be done to preserve banks' ability to provide finance for investment in the economy. Another diplomatic source cited Orban as telling the same meeting that the future of the sector could be "re-evaluated". Societe Generale suggested in a March 13 note to clients that "some government policies are likely to gradually normalise, including a compromise with the beleaguered banking sector."  On Wednesday, Orban said there was more to do in order to boost the share of domestic players in banking and "change the ownership structure" in the sector. His government looks on foreign manufacturers more favourably, diplomats say, while a recent deal with Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> signals a softening of the approach to the services sector.
