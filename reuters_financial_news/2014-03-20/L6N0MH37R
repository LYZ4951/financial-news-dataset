March 20 (Reuters) - Money supply (M3) in the United Arab Emirates grew 11.6 percent year-on-year at the end of January after a 12.6 percent rise in the previous month, central bank data showed on Thursday.

Bank lending growth in one of the world's top oil exporters decelerated to 6.7 percent year-on-year from 7.1 percent in December, which was the fastest rate since at least February 2010, the data also showed.
