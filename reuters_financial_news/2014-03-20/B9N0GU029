SHANGHAI, March 20 (Reuters) - China's main Shanghai Stock Exchange said it has relaxed restrictions for investment by overseas institutional investors, allowing them to invest in more products and raising the limit for their shareholding in listed firms.

With immediate effect, the exchange raised the shareholding limit by Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) and the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) in a single company to 30 percent from 20 percent, according to new rules by the exchange published on its website late on Wednesday.
