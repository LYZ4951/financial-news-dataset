LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> said on Thursday it was considering the introduction of a new intra-day auction in response to demand from customers to improve flexibility in executing trades.

A consultation process is underway over the proposal, and LSE said that a "broad range of market participants" had given positive feedback over the idea, which would be a "welcomed addition to the options available for executing orders".
