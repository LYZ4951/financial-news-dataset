SEOUL, March 20 (Reuters) - Seoul shares fell to their lowest closing level in six weeks on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen spoke of a possible earlier-than-expected U.S. rate hike.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> ended down 0.9 percent at 1,919.52 points, its weakest close since Feb. 6. Foreign investors offloaded a net 215.6 billion won ($201.4 million) of KOSPI shares, becoming net-sellers for a ninth consecutive session. Large-cap stocks led the broader market's slide, with crude oil refiner SK Innovation Co Ltd <096770.KS> down 6 percent and shipbuilder Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co Ltd off 5.1 percent.
