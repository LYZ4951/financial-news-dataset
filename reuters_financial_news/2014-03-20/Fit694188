March 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Taiwan-based IBT  Securities Co., Ltd.'s (IBTS) National Long-Term Rating at 'BBB+(twn)' and  National Short-Term Rating at 'F2(twn)'. The Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IBTS's ratings reflect its strategic importance to its parent Industrial Bank of  Taiwan <2897.TWO> (IBT), which owns 94.8% of IBTS. As a result, IBT has a high propensity  to support its subsidiary should there be a need. This is underpinned by IBT's  committed liquidity facility, managerial control and operational integration in  strategy and risk governance. From a standalone perspective, IBTS maintains a  sound balance sheet, despite its relatively small franchise and volatile  earnings. Fitch believes IBTS's underwriting capability and capital market services will  continue to have synergies with IBT's corporate banking business, and reinforce  the group franchise. Such alignment should strengthen the likelihood of support  from its parent. Management aims to expand its institutional business and  enhance underwriting by focusing its research on certain sectors, including  biotechnology and IT. Fitch expects IBTS's profitability to remain susceptible to its proprietary  trading activities, given its modest brokerage revenue. However, its fee-based  underwriting business and lowered trading appetite should help improve earnings  stability. IBTS's bond position suffered a sizable loss in 2013 due to the steep  rate increase in the bond market. Management had exercised effective risk  control to stop losses. IBTS significantly reduced its interest-rate risk by  shrinking its bond position and resetting the trading limit to a low level.  Fitch expects IBTS to maintain an adequate capital profile, considering its  reduced exposure limit and strong group support if needed. Its capital adequacy  ratio remained strong at 300%-500% during 2012-1H13, and reached 610% at  end-2013 as market risk shrank. IBTS maintains a sufficient liquidity position  with a healthy net current asset surplus. It moderates its funding risk by  holding high-quality fixed-income securities against repurchase transactions.  Moreover, the parent's contingent funding facility also reinforces its liquidity  profile.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  IBTS's ratings move in tandem with IBT's credit profile and potential support.  Negative rating action could result from any deterioration in IBT's financial  strength, possibly from excessive risk-taking. Any weakening in the links  between IBTS and its parent, including ownership dilution and reduced strategic  importance of IBTS within the group, would pressure its ratings.
