KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Reuters) - Malaysian oilfield service provider SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd <SKPE.KL> said on Thursday it has signed a $5 billion refinancing deal with 13 banks to partly fund two of its most recent acquisitions.

The company bought Seadrill Ltd's <SDRL.OL> tender rig business in 2012 and the entire equity stake of Newfield Exploration Co's <NFX.N> Malaysian oil and gas assets last year. The refinancing was also done to replace and streamline its existing borrowing facilities, SapuraKencana said in a statement. The deal, of which 70 percent is in U.S. dollars, constitutes a senior multi-currency term and revolving facilities with short and long-term tenures of up to seven years, according to the company. Maybank <MBBM.KL> and CIMB <CIMB.KL> were the coordinating banks while Maybank acted as the agent and the security agent, it added.
