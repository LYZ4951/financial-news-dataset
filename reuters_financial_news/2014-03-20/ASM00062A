March 20 (Reuters) - Aberdeen Asset Management Plc <ADN.L> said on Thursday it had received regulatory approval to buy Lloyds Banking Group's <LLOY.L> fund management arm Scottish Widows Investment Partnership.

Aberdeen said approval by the Financial Conduct Authority meant the deal would likely be completed on March 31. Aberdeen struck a deal in November to buy Scottish Widows for about 660 million pounds ($1.10 billion), creating Europe's No. 1 listed stand-alone fund manager. [ID:nL5N0J3199]
