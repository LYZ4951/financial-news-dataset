LONDON, March 20 (Reuters) - UK shopping centre owner Intu Properties <INTUP.L> on Thursday said it aimed to raise 500 million pounds ($831.4 million) through a rights issue to help fund the acquisition of two shopping centres and a retail park.

Intu is issuing two new shares for every seven existing shares, at 180 pence each. That represents a discount of 42.5 percent to the closing price of 313.2 pence on March 19.  The company is buying the retail centres from Westfield <WRT.AX>. One of the shopping centres, Merry Hill, is part-owned by Australian asset manager QIC <QINVES.UL>, which has a 50 percent stake. Merrill Lynch International <BAC.N>, UBS <UBSN.VX> and HSBC <HSBA.L> are acting as joint bookrunners. Intu did not name the underwriter.
