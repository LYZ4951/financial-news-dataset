March 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned SC Germany Auto 2014-1 UG (haftungsbeschraenkt)'s EUR553.5m class A notes a final rating as follows: EUR553.5m class A notes: assigned 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR46.5m class B notes: not rated EUR6m subordinated loan: not rated The transaction is a repeat securitisation of auto loans originated by Santander  Consumer Bank AG [CCKGg.UL] (SCB), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander  Consumer Finance S.A. [SANCN.UL] (SCF, BBB+/Stable/F2). SC Germany Auto 2014-1 UG  (haftungsbeschraenkt) is a special purpose company incorporated with limited  liability under German law.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on Fitch's assessment of SCB's origination and servicing  procedures, the agency's expectations of future asset performance, the available  credit enhancement and the transaction's legal structure.  Fitch applied a default base case of 1.75% for the transaction compared with  1.85% for the previous SC Germany Auto 2013-2. Furthermore, the agency  determined a base case recovery rate of 40%. The lower default base case is due  to continuing strong performance of the latest vintages, the economic  environment and sound performance of existing transactions. Fitch applied a  higher 'AAA' rating default multiple of 7.15x, reflecting the stable economic  outlook applied in deriving the default base case, which does not incorporate  any significant stress. SCB is an experienced auto loan underwriter in Germany, with a sound servicing  track record. Previous SC Germany Auto transactions have continued to perform  within or better than Fitch's initial expectations.  SCB is also the servicer for the transaction. Cash reserves were funded at  closing to cover the potential risks stemming from: (i) commingling; and (ii)  set-off (arising from customer deposits, handling fee claims and  insurance-related set-off claims). Fitch expects the performance of German auto loans to remain stable over the  next two years. The unemployment rate - an important risk factor for German auto  transactions - is at historically low levels and Fitch expects it to remain  stable over the next two years.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Expected impact upon the note rating of increased defaults (class A): Current Rating: 'AAAsf' Increase base case defaults by 10%: 'AA+sf' Increase base case defaults by 25%: 'AAsf' Increase base case defaults by 50%: 'A+sf'  Expected impact upon the note rating of reduced recoveries (class A): Original Rating: 'AAAsf' Reduce base case recovery by 10%: 'AA+sf' Reduce base case recovery by 25%: 'AA+sf' Reduce base case recovery by 50%: 'AA+sf'  Expected impact upon the note rating of increased defaults and reduced  recoveries (class A): Current Rating: 'AAAsf' Increase default base case by 10%; reduce recovery base case by 10%: 'AA+sf' Increase default base case by 25%; reduce recovery base case by 25%: 'AA-sf' Increase default base case by 50%; reduce recovery base case by 50%: 'Asf'  TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS The issuance proceeds were used to purchase a portfolio of auto loan receivables  originated by SCB. The receivables are secured by the financed vehicles and are  granted exclusively to German residents. The transaction is static and has  started amortising from closing.  The portfolio consists of 77,376 loan contracts, with an outstanding aggregate  principal balance of EUR600m and a weighted average remaining term of 43.9  months. The loans have been granted by SCB to buyers of new (40%) and used (60%)  vehicles. The portfolio is highly granular in terms of regional distribution  within Germany and debtor concentration, with the top 25 obligors accounting for  0.23% of the portfolio notional. The notes amortise on a sequential basis. At closing, credit enhancement for the  class A notes was equal to 8.75%, made up of overcollateralisation through  subordination (7.75%) and a fully-funded reserve fund (1%). While the reserve  fund is available from closing, initially it only provides liquidity coverage to  the transaction. Once the notes have amortised by 50%, the reserve will then  also be available to cover any losses in the respective period. Additionally,  the transaction is expected to generate excess spread that provides a first  layer of default protection. The issuer has entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the mismatch between  fixed interest received from the receivables and variable payments on the class  A notes. The swap notional is based on the lower of the outstanding class A  notes' balance and a fixed notional schedule based on a 0% prepayment and  default assumption. This structure could leave the class A notes with partially  unhedged interest rate risk but may be mitigated by the available credit  enhancement.
