MOSCOW, March 20 (Reuters) - The Russian government will not bail out company owners who may face financial difficulties as it did during the 2008-2009 crisis, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Thursday.

Russian business owners have expressed concerns about the impact of western sanctions over Moscow's decision to bring Crimea into its territory.
