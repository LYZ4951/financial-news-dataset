March 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sanlam Life Insurance Limited's [SLMJL.UL] (Sanlam Life) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'AA+(zaf)', National Long-term rating at 'AA(zaf)' and National Short-term rating at 'F1+(zaf)'. Fitch has also affirmed Sanlam Life's  subordinated debt at 'A+(zaf)'.  Fitch has also affirmed Sanlam Life's parent and the ultimate holding company of  the Sanlam group, Sanlam Limited's <SLMJ.J> (Sanlam) National Long-term rating at  'AA-(zaf)'. Concurrently, Fitch has affirmed Sanlam Developing Markets Limited's  (SDM) National IFS rating at 'AA+(zaf)' and National Long-term rating at  'AA(zaf)'.  All the Outlooks are Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of Sanlam's and Sanlam Life's ratings reflects the Sanlam  group's well-established and diversified business position in South Africa, its  sound and resilient capitalisation and its strong operating performance. SDM's  ratings are aligned with those of the primary operating entity within the group,  Sanlam Life, as SDM is assessed as "Core" to the Sanlam group under Fitch's  insurance group rating methodology. Fitch considers SDM as "Core" because its  business, operations and strategy are fully aligned with those of the group.  Fitch considers Sanlam's capital levels as strong. Sanlam Life's statutory  capital adequacy requirement (CAR) cover ratio was 4.5x at 31 December 2013  (2012: 4.3x), the highest level in its peer group. Sanlam reported ZAR4bn of discretionary capital, i.e. capital regarded by the  group as being in excess of economic capital requirements, at end-2013  (end-2012: ZAR4.2bn). The bulk of Sanlam's ZAR1.8bn investments in 2013 was  focused on strategic growth areas in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. Fitch  expects the group to continue using the excess capital to increase business from  high-growth areas.  Sanlam's earnings generation continues to be strong and compares favourably with  that of its leading peers. Normalised headline earnings increased to ZAR8.1bn in  2013 (2012: ZAR5.9bn), supported by strong investment performance and increased  contributions from growth markets.  Total net covered new business margin on a present value of new business premium  (PVNBP) basis was broadly stable at 3.1% in 2013 (2012: 3.2%).   RATING SENSITIVITIES If Sanlam achieves successful entry into new markets while maintaining its  strong operating performance, capitalisation and leading position in South  Africa, this would be positive for ratings. However, an upgrade is unlikely  unless Sanlam gains meaningful market shares in new markets, which Fitch does  not expect in the near- to medium-term.
