WARSAW, March 20 (Reuters) - The Polish treasury expects to receive an offer for its majority stake in real-estate holding company PHN <PHN.WA> next month, as the ministry aims to privatise the company in the first half of this year, the deputy treasury minister said on Thursday.

"Technically it is possible that a bid for PHN will happen in April," Pawel Tamborski told Reuters. The group, with a real-estate portoflio estimated at 2.23 billion zlotys ($738.9 million), swung last year to a net profit of 107 million zlotys from a loss of 186 million in 2012. The treasury controls 73 percent of PHN, a stake that the market values at almost 1 billion zlotys ($331.33 million) or a fourth of what the ministry aims to raise through its  privatisation plan for this year.
