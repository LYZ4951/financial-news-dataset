BRASILIA, March 20 (Reuters) - Liquidity risks to Brazilian banks should remain stable in the first half of 2014 despite a slight increase in the previous six months, central bank director Anthero Meirelles said on Thursday.

Liquidity risks to the system increased slightly in the second half of last year but remain very low, the central bank said in a semiannual financial report released earlier on Thursday.
