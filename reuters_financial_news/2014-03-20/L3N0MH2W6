BANGKOK, March 20 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares posted their biggest loss in almost two months on Thursday as investors sold off large-caps while Thai shares fell for a third day as concerns about a sooner-than-expected rise in U.S. interest rates triggered selling across the region.

Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> ended down 2.5 percent, its worst one-day fall since Jan. 27. The Top 45 large-cap stocks <.JKLQ45> fell 3.3 percent, with the biggest losers including Bank Danamon <BDMN.JK> and developer Summarecon Agung <SMRA.JK>. Optimism over Indonesia's election this year has bolstered sentiment in the share market. The sell-offs trimmed its year-to-date gain in U.S. dollar terms to 18.2 percent, but still retained its position as Asia's second best performer so far this year. The Thai SET index <.SETI> fell 0.2 percent to its lowest close in more than one week, led by a 5 percent drop in shares of Charoen Pokphand Foods <CPF.BK>, partly due to profit-taking. Foreign investors were net sellers of Thai shares for the first time in three sessions. The lifting of the emergency decree in Bangkok has attracted foreign buying over the past two sessions. <TH/TRADING02>[ID:nL3N0MF18I] Malaysia <.KLSE> closed nearly unchanged, reporting a net foreign selling of 143.5 million ringgit ($43.78 million)
