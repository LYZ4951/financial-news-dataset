NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Mar 19 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $1.9 billion to $1.019 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $6.3 billion to $1.046 trillion.
