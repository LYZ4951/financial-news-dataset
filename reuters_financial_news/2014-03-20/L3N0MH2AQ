HONG KONG, March 20 (Reuters) - Global exporter Li & Fung Ltd <0494.HK> reported a 17 percent rise in full-year net profit, boosted by a strengthened foothold in Asia as the company moves to capture increasing consumer spending in the region.

The consumer goods exporter, which supplies retailers such as Kohl's Corp <KSS.N> and Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> with clothing, toys and other products, posted a net profit of $725 million for 2013, beating forecasts of $577.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters' Starmine SmartEstimate. That compared to a net profit of $617 million in 2012.
