MUMBAI, March 20 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended lower on Thursday, retreating further from record highs hit at the start of the week, on worries U.S. interest rates would rise sooner than expected and dent the appeal of higher-yielding emerging markets.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> closed 0.37 percent lower at 21,753.12, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 0.63 percent down at 6,483.10.
