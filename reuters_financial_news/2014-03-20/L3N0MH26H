MUMBAI, March 20 (Reuters) - IDFC Alternatives Ltd, a private equity fund managed by India's IDFC Ltd <IDFC.NS>, raised 7.5 billion rupees ($122.94 million) for a debt fund that will lend to developers of residential real-estate across the country.

The debt fund will be backed by housing projects that are under construction across Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, IDFC said in a statement on Thursday. Sluggish home sales and high interest rates in Asia's third-largest economy are putting pressure on debt-laden developers, that need to raise funds to recapitalise existing bank loans and invest in future projects.
