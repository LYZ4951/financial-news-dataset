HANOI, March 20 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VN Index <.VNI> fell 0.26 percent at Thursday's break, coming down from a high of more than four years scaled a day earlier and led by selling in equities that rose in recent weeks.

Food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> led the fall, dropping 1.85 percent while top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> lost 0.82 percent. "Investors took profit out of penny stocks and some blue chips after recent gains," said deputy manager Nguyen Tuan at An Binh Securities. The VN Index closed at its highest since October 2009 on Wednesday, fuelled by a central bank decision to delay the start of a new debt classification process, giving banks more time to tackle non-performing loans. [ID:nL3N0MG2CB] Trading volume was high, reaching 126.7 million shares at midday on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, compared with the full-day average over the past five days of 171.7 million, according to Reuters data.
