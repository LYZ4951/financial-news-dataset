NAIROBI, March 20 (Reuters) - Kenyan insurer Jubilee Holdings <JUB.NR> posted a 17 percent rise in pretax profit for last year to 3.15 billion shillings ($36.4 million), it said on Thursday.

Insurance is seen as a growth area in the east African nation, with the latest data showing only about 8 percent of the population has any form of coverage. The company attributed the jump in earnings to a 16 percent rise in its gross written premiums to 23.42 billion shillings.
