May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

A slim majority of senior European credit investors favour regulatory intervention to prevent a bubble in the European high-yield bond and loan markets, according to Fitch Ratings' latest quarterly investor survey. The heightened concern comes as monthly European high-yield issuance volumes hit an all-time record. In total, 51% of respondents agreed that European regulators should step in to  calm markets, as the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency are attempting in the US leveraged loan market. Most of those in favour  of intervention said it should be limited to "skin-in-the-game" rules for  underwriters, but 22% of respondents wanted a tougher response, including  explicit limits on leverage and underwriting standards. We believe this result reflects increasing anxiety among investors that too much  money is chasing too few income-producing assets. Investors feel they have  little choice but to invest in whatever comes to market, despite the continuing  fall in yields and coupons. Declining returns are accompanied by weaker credit quality among new issues,  including higher leverage, increased subordination and looser lending terms.  This fall in new-issue credit quality underlines our view that losses from the  next leveraged finance default cycle may be significantly greater than in  previous cycles, as fiscal and monetary support will be more limited and issuers  shift from core bank relationships to capital market funding options. The increasing concern among high yield investors is visible in other survey  responses. Investment-grade financials took over as the most favoured marginal  investment choice after a 15-month run for the high-yield sector, and 51% of  respondents said they now believe that high yield is overvalued. Nearly half of respondents expect high-yield issuance volumes to continue  rising, against 7% that expect a decline. May is on course to be the  highest-volume month ever following Numericable's record bond offering, which  was issued at the start of the month. It will also be close to the record for  the number of deals.
