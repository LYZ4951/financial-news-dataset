LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Nationwide <POB_p.L>, Britain's biggest customer-owned lender,  said it more than doubled its underlying profit last year and  hit a capital target set by Britain's financial regulator a year ahead of schedule.

Nationwide on Wednesday reported a 113 percent rise in underlying profit to 924 million pounds ($1.55 billion) in the year to end March, benefiting from increased lending and a decline in costs. "Our excellent financial performance and the successful achievement of a 3 percent leverage ratio, well ahead of plan, shows Nationwide has emerged from the financial crisis in better shape than ever," said Chief Executive Graham Beale.
