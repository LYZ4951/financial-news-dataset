DUESSELDORF, May 28 (Reuters) - Any deal to combine the power assets of engineering companies Siemens <SIEGn.DE> and Alstom <ALSO.PA> would face regulatory scrutiny from European Union antitrust authorities, Andreas Mundt, president of the German cartel office said.

Siemens told French lawmakers yesterday that it hoped to submit an asset swap offer which would hand the German engineering company most of Alstom's power assets in exchange for giving up control of its trains business.
