May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned CFHL-1 2014's notes the following ratings: EUR428,000,000 Class A1: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR376,000,000 Class A2: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR33,000,000 Class B: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR28,000,000 Class C: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable EUR19,000,000 Class D: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable EUR23,000,000 Class E: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable EUR20,436,498 Subordinated units: not rated  The transaction is a true sale securitisation of French residential loans  originated by Credit Foncier de France [CADEGF.UL] (CFF; A/Stable/F1), a wholly owned  subsidiary of Groupe BPCE [GBPCE.UL] (GBPCE; A/Stable/F1). Credit enhancement (CE) for the  class A1 and A2 notes totals 13.4% of the securitised pool and is provided by  the subordination of junior notes as well as a general reserve funded with the  notes at inception and representing 0.5% of the initial rated note balance.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Low LTVs The pool has a low weighted average (WA) original loan-to-value ratio of 72.9%,  below the levels seen in most French residential pools analysed by Fitch. This  is atypical for a specialised lender such as CFF.   Dual Security Types Pool  Loans are either secured by a first-ranking mortgage or a caution (ie a specific  guarantee offered to borrowers by dedicated financial institutions or insurance  companies) from Credit Logement for 19.2% of the portfolio. Fitch has made  particular assumptions on cautions in its recovery analysis. Due to stricter origination conditions, loans secured by a caution tend to  perform better than loans secured by a mortgage. The foreclosure frequency of  the loans has been adjusted to reflect this positive bias, in light of available  historical data. Fitch recovery analysis of these loans depends on the  probability that the guarantor will honour its payment obligation in a stress  scenario. In the absence of a 100% payment by the guarantor, recoveries are  derived partially from the assumed sale of the financed property and partially  from unsecured recoveries.   Issue of Further A2 Notes  After five years, the issuer may issue up to two new series of class A2 notes,  subject to certain conditions, the issue proceeds of which would be applied to  redeem the existing class A2 notes. The terms and conditions of the new class A2  notes would be substantially the same as those of the original class A2 notes.  Concentrated Counterparty Exposure The transaction relies strongly on CFF's creditworthiness, which fulfils a  number of roles (eg servicer and interest rate swap counterparty) in the  transaction. Several structural features are in place to mitigate, in  particular, commingling and liquidity risks in the transaction.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Material increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted  receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's expectations, which in  turn may result in potential rating actions on the notes. If the agency stressed  its 'AAA' assumptions by 30% for both weighted average foreclosure frequency and  recovery rate, it would possibly result in a downgrade of the class A notes to  'Asf'. More detailed model implied ratings sensitivity can be found in the new issue  report, which will shortly be available at www.fitchratings.com. Fitch was provided with loan-by-loan information on the securitised portfolio as  of February 2014. The data fields included in the pool cut were of good quality.  To analyse CE, Fitch evaluated the collateral using its default model, details  of which can be found in the reports entitled 'EMEA Residential Mortgage Loss  Criteria', dated June 2013, and "EMEA Criteria Addendum - France", dated 13 June  2013, available at www.fitchratings.com. The agency assessed the transaction  cash flows using default and loss severity assumptions under various structural  stresses including prepayment speeds and interest rate scenarios. The cash flow  tests showed that each class of notes could withstand loan losses at a level  corresponding to the related stress scenario without incurring any principal  loss or interest shortfall and can retire principal by the legal final maturity  of April 2058.
