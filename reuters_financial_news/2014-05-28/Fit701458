May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published a performance report on Eternal 6 Special Purpose Vehicle Co., Ltd.  The transaction is a securitisation of credit card receivables originated by  AEON Thana Sinsap (Thailand) Public Company Limited <AEONTS.BK> (BBB+(tha)/Positive/F2(tha)), a consumer finance company in Thailand. The report discusses the key rating drivers for the transaction, which include  asset performance and structural features (for example, credit enhancement and  rapid amortisation triggers). Since closing in May 2013, each key performance  parameter has remained largely within Fitch's base case expectations. Fitch  believes political uncertainty and rising household debt in Thailand are the key  risks for the asset performance of this transaction in the near future. However,  Fitch's base-case assumptions were determined based on historical data covering  more than nine years, including a period of political instability in 2006. In  addition, Fitch set the base-case default rate and monthly payment rate  conservatively compared with the performance observed in recent years,  reflecting the rising household debt. Therefore, Fitch expects the asset  performance to continue to remain broadly within its base-case assumptions and  will continue to monitor it closely. Fitch's most recent rating action on this transaction was on 11 April 2014,  where the ratings of the debentures were affirmed at 'A-sf' with Stable Outlook.
