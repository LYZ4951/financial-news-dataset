May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Thailand's four largest commercial banks and their three subsidiaries. The Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) on Bangkok Bank Public Company Limited <BBL.BK> (BBL), Kasikornbank Public Company Limited <KBANK.BK> (KBANK) and Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited <SCB.BK> (SCB) have been affirmed at 'BBB+' and their National Long-Term Ratings at 'AA(tha)'. Krung Thai Bank Public Company Limited's <KTB.BK> (KTB) Long-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'BBB' and its National Long-Term Rating at  'AA+(tha)'. The Outlooks are Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the National Long-Term Ratings on the banks' three  subsidiaries, Kasikorn Securities Public Company Limited (KS), SCB Securities  Company Limited (SCBS) and KTB Leasing Company Limited (KTBL) at 'AA-(tha)'.  A full list of rating actions is included at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VRs, National Ratings and Senior Debt The IDRs and National Ratings of BBL, KBANK and SCB are driven by their  Viability Ratings (VRs), while the IDR of KTB is driven by its Support Rating  Floor.  The National Ratings of KS, SCBS and KTBL are driven by their strategic  importance to their groups, and as a result, KS is notched once, SCBS once and  KTBL twice from their respective their parent banks' ratings. The senior debt ratings of BBL, KBANK, SCB and KTB are at the same level as the  IDRs (for international ratings) or National Ratings, as the debt represent  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the banks.   The banks' VRs are driven by their strong domestic franchises, sound capital  levels, and acceptable loan loss reserves.  Fitch expects the operating environment to be more challenging in the future,  which may impact the banks' performance. The Thai economy faces significant  downside risks, with some signs already seen in 1Q14 of deteriorating asset  quality in the banking system. However, we believe that the buffers of these  four banks remain acceptable and sufficient for the banks to cope with a normal  cyclical economic downturn.  Fitch expects BBL's credit profile to remain resilient against potential risks  through its maintenance of strong capital and reserve buffers, although its  concentration in corporate loans is relatively high compared with other major  local banks. BBL continues to maintain a high level of high-quality capital,  with Core Tier 1 ratio at 14.3% at end-2013. At the same time, BBL also has the  strongest level of loan loss reserve coverage among Thai banks at 214% at  end-2013. Fitch expects KBANK's well-diversified portfolio and moderate risk appetite,  reflected by its slower loan growth (compared with local peers) over the past  few years, to provide some buffer against future asset quality risks.  SCB's ratings reflect its sound franchise, particularly in retail banking, and  good performance. It has grown relatively quickly in recent years, but at the  same time it has maintained acceptable levels of capital and improved its asset  quality buffers. KTB's VR is two notches lower than the other three banks, reflecting its  relatively weaker operating and financial performance and the quasi-policy  responsibility it bears (although KTB has become more commercial in nature).  While many of KTB's metrics have improved over the past several years, key  financial ratios such as asset quality and leverage are still more comparable to  'bbb-' rated international peers.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs, National Ratings and Senior Debt Protracted economic weakness from a very severe downturn could have a  larger-than-expected impact on the banks' asset quality and performance. The  recent rise in private-sector leverage (particularly in the household sector)  may lead to unanticipated adverse impacts on businesses and consumers in the  event of a sharp economic slowdown. If Fitch deems that this would have a  material negative impact on the banks' capital buffers, it could take negative  rating actions on the VRs of the four banks, and subsequently on the IDRs and  National Ratings of BBL, KBANK and SCB. A further deepening and extension of the  economic downturn that is related to the current political uncertainties could  lead to a bigger impact on bank asset quality and absorption buffers. A downgrade of Thailand's sovereign rating could lead to a similar impact on the  VRs of BBL, KBANK and SCB, as these are currently at the same level as the  sovereign.   KEY RATING DRIVERS - Support Rating and Support Rating Floor The Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors of the four banks reflect their  clear systemic importance to the Thai banking system. The four banks together  account for more than 60% of total commercial bank deposits and loans.  KTB's Support Rating Floor at 'BBB' is one notch higher than the other three  banks. This reflects KTB's strategic importance to the government - it is the  only state-owned commercial bank, with close operational and branding links with  the Finance Ministry.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - Support Rating and Support Rating Floor A reduced propensity of the government to support systemically important banks  could result in a downgrade in the Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors of  the banks, but we view this to be unlikely in the medium term. A change in the  sovereign ratings could also lead to a change in the Support Ratings and Support  Rating Floors.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - Subordinated debt  BBL's US dollar subordinated debt is rated one notch below its IDR. The four  banks' Thai baht subordinated debts are rated one notch below their National  Long-Term Ratings. This is to reflect their subordination in the capital  structure and is in line with Fitch's approach to rating such subordinated debt  instruments of financial institutions. These subordinated debts are legacy  instruments, which are not Basel III-compliant.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - Subordinated debt The banks' subordinated debt ratings would be affected by changes to the banks'  IDR/ National Long-Term Ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - Hybrid Tier 1 KTB's international hybrid Tier 1 rating of 'B' is rated five notches below the  VR, reflecting their going-concern risks that include a non-cumulative coupon  deferral feature that could be triggered upon the bank posting a loss. The  national hybrid Tier 1 rating also reflects this implied notching approach from  the VR.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - Hybrid Tier 1 Any changes in KTB's VR could impact the ratings on KTB's hybrid Tier 1  securities.
