HONG KONG, May 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares climbed on Wednesday led by strength in financial stocks, tracking gains in other Asian markets as upbeat U.S. economic data lifted sentiment.

China shares eked out slim gains in choppy trade, buoyed by gains in property and software companies. By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was up 0.8 percent at 23,133.99 points, reaching a fresh 1-1/2-month high. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong jumped 1.4 percent. If gains hold, this would be the best day in two weeks for the China Enterprises Index. The CSI300 <.CSI300> added 0.2 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was up 0.2 percent at 2,037.78 points. Both swung between negative and positive territory in the morning. Strong gains in the financial sector drove Hong Kong's benchmark index up during the last hour of the morning session, as investors cheered upbeat U.S. economic data and another record close for the S&P 500.[.N] Riskier asset markets were underpinned overnight after the United States reported an unexpected rise in durable goods orders in April and higher home prices for March.
