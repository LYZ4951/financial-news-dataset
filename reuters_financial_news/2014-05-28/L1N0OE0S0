BOSTON, May 28 (Reuters) - Blackrock Inc <BLK.N> Chief Executive Larry Fink, who runs the world's largest asset manager, said on Wednesday he has fielded angry phone calls over a letter he sent in March to S&P 500 executives that warned them about the perils of short-term thinking.

"I've had some really angry phone calls," Fink said at a New York investment conference hosted by Sanford Bernstein. He did not name any of the angry callers.
