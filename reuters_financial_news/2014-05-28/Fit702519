May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Germany-based Volkswagen AG's <VOWG_p.DE> Long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) and senior unsecured notes to 'A'  from 'A-'  and Short-term IDR to 'F1' from 'F2'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR is Stable. Fitch has also upgraded Volkswagen International Finance NV's [VOWGI.UL] guaranteed notes to 'A' from 'A-'. The upgrade reflects the group's resilient performance in a currently highly  adverse and competitive automotive environment and comfortable financial  headroom in its ratings. Earnings declined slightly in 2013 and are likely to  erode further in 2014 but we expect a recovery in 2015 as benefits from the  group's new platform increase and the product portfolio strengthens further. In  addition, profitability and key financial ratios remain strong for the rating  category. The group's business profile is also well in line with the 'A' rating  category. Recent acquisitions have moderately weakened some of Volkswagen's key credit  metrics but the financial profile remains strong, including a substantial cash  position and conservative financial policy, as well as a significant cash  generation ability. We believe that the group's ratings can accommodate some  further moderate ad-hoc cash outflows, but our rating case does not include  numerous and substantial acquisitions or cash expenses.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Declining but Resilient Margins Operating margin declined to 5.9% in 2013 from 6% in 2012 and 7.1% in 2011,  excluding the robust double-digit margins from its Chinese joint ventures.  However, these margins remain solid considering the adverse environment and  significant investments the group has made during the same period. Fitch expects  profitability to erode further in 2014 from weak pricing in Europe and weakening  sales in other regions, but we expect operating margins to rebound to more than  6.5% by 2016.  Modular Toolkit Strategy Fitch expects the new modular transverse toolkit (MQB) platform strategy to  generate substantial time and cost savings in development, purchases and  production. However, it poses the risk of a flaw or quality issue with that  platform, which could have major repercussions. In addition, brand management  will be key to maintain a clear differentiation between the group's various  brands in spite of common parts.  Above-Average Business Profile Volkswagen's ratings are supported by its unparalleled product portfolio in the  auto and heavy-truck segments. They also reflect its broad geographical  diversification, leading market shares and an unrivalled potential for cost  savings and economies of scale.  M&A Risk M&A risk remains present given the group's acquisitive strategy and history. The  recent acquisition of Scania's minorities for EUR6.7bn has been completed while  an offer on MAN's remaining shares is still pending and could cost up to  EUR3.5bn. We believe that other acquisitions are probable to support  Volkswagen's growth strategy, potentially in the truck sector and to purchase  another stake in its JV with FAW in China.  High Cash Outflows Volkswagen has ambitious investment plans of EUR84bn through to 2018 to support  growth. This should materially affect operating margins through increasing  depreciation in coming years. However, higher investments should ultimately  benefit its product offering and industrial footprint.  Robust Liquidity The group maintains a solid net cash position, backed by ample liquidity. At  end-1Q14, it reported gross cash and equivalents of EUR25.7bn at group level,  plus EUR8.6bn of short-term securities (including EUR22.7bn and EUR7bn,  respectively, for the industrial business). This is compared with EUR13.6bn of  financial debt from the group's industrial activities. Recent market  transactions include the hybrid debt issuance of EUR2bn in 2013 and of EUR3bn in  1Q14. We also expect up to EUR2bn of preferred shares to be issued to partly  refinance the Scania deal.  Below-Peers Corporate Governance Fitch considers Volkswagen's corporate governance as weaker than at its main  peers, although this does not have a direct and immediate impact on the ratings.  Key areas of weakness include a 20% blocking minority in voting resolutions,  conflicts of interest between some board members including between Porsche and  Volkswagen, and lack of independence and diversity at the supervisory board  level.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: -Operating margins remaining below 3% (for industrial operations) and 4% (at  group level) (5.6% and 5.9% at end-2013, respectively; 5.4% and 5.7%, expected  at end-2014, respectively) -Significant deterioration in key credit metrics including adjusted gross  leverage above 1.5x (1.3x at end-2013; 1.0x expected at end-2014) -Cash from operations on debt below 60% (89% at end-2013; 80% expected at  end-2014, recovering to more than 100% at end-2015). This could result, in  particular, from aggressive M&A or accelerated capex without a parallel  improvement in earnings.
