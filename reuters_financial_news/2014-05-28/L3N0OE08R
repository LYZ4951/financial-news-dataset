HONG KONG, May 28 (Reuters) - Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <0013.HK> conglomerate said two companies controlled by the tycoon have teamed up to buy a Canadian off-airport car park operator for C$397.5 million ($366 million) as Asia's richest man continues to invest abroad.

The deal sees Hutchison's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd <1038.HK> (CKI) and property group Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd <0001.HK> pair up to extend a strategy of investing in infrastructure opportunities around the world, Hutchison said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse early on Wednesday. CKI will fund the deal by internal resources. The pair are buying the Park'N Fly off-airport parking business, operating in Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, Ottawa and Vancouver, from a group of Canadian investors. These included BRL Realty Ltd, 1250353 Ontario Ltd, RNE Realty Ltd, Park'N Fly Partnership, and 1420291 Alberta Ltd.  The deal came less than a month after CKI joined forces with Cheung Kong and Power Assets <0006.HK> to launch an unsolicited $1.8 billion takeover offer to buy the remaining shares in Australian gas distributor Envestra Ltd <ENV.AX>.
