May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its three core EMEA RMBS rating criteria: the EMEA RMBS Master Rating Criteria, EMEA Residential Mortgage Loss Criteria and EMEA RMBS Cash Flow Analysis Criteria. The updated criteria do not contain any changes to the rating framework and will therefore not have a rating impact on existing transactions.  The Master Rating Criteria report summarises Fitch's methodology for assessing  credit risk in RMBS transactions in EMEA, including asset performance,  operational risk, cash flow analysis, legal analysis, and counterparty risk. The  criteria apply to both new and existing transactions. The report has been  amended to outline how Fitch monitors the validity of its criteria assumptions  on a quarterly basis.  The agency has also updated its EMEA Residential Mortgage Loss Criteria and its  EMEA RMBS Cash Flow Analysis criteria to include further details on the  underlying rating approach.   In the Mortgage Loss Criteria report, Fitch has added a section explaining how  it analyses representations and warranties provided by entities rated below  investment grade. In addition, the loss criteria have been amended to outline  the main factors taken into account when deriving foreclosure frequency  assumptions of employee loans. Finally, the loss criteria now clarify that for  debt-to-income ratio (DTI) calculation of floating-rate loans, where deemed more  appropriate, the agency may use a long-term equilibrium rate that corresponds to  a country-specific mortgage rate rather than the currency's standard reference  interbank offer rates.  Fitch is in the process of updating the separate country-specific criteria  addenda containing residential mortgage loss and cash flow related assumptions  for Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,  Spain, South Africa and the UK."EMEA RMBS Master Rating Criteria", "EMEA Residential Mortgage Loss Criteria",  and EMEA RMBS Cash Flow Analysis Criteria" are available at  www.fitchratings.com.
