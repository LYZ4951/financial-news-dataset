HANOI, May 28 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> was up 0.33 percent at Wednesday's break, on track for its third consecutive session of gains, as retailers extended buying after a strong rally in the previous day, an analyst said.

Equities closed near their three-week highs on Tuesday as retailers thought current prices reflected an ongoing conflict between Vietnam and China after Beijing's deployment of an oil rig in the disputed South China Sea. [ID:nL3N0OD1RO] Food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> led gains with a 1.62 percent rise, followed by Ho Chi Minh City-based Sacombank <STB.HM> with a 4.26 percent advance. Gains were strong in early trade, but an increase in selling towards the midday break boosted volume to 70.1 million shares, near the five full-day average level of 99.5 million shares, Reuters data showed. "Money inflow from retailers is usually short-term, so the index may dip soon on profit-taking," said analyst Nguyen The Minh from Viet Capital Securities.
