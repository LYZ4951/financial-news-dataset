HONG KONG, May 28 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc <HSBA.L> has hired former Barclays banker Jason Rynbeck as its head of mergers and acquisitions for Asia-Pacific, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

Rynbeck left Barclays on May 8, Reuters previously reported [ID:nL3N0O02O8], amid a global shrinking of the lender's investment banking division. He will join HSBC later this year after a period of leave following his departure from Barclays, one of the people said.
