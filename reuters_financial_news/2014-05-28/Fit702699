May 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The European Parliament election results have strengthened the mandates of the ruling parties in Italy and Spain, and even the results in Greece and Portugal show considerable support for economic reform. The sustainable economic and fiscal policies being pursued in these countries are key factors underpinning ratings in the region.  In Italy, Matteo Renzi's centre-left PD polled exceptionally strongly (41% vote  share), following a campaign fought primarily on the issues of reform and the  suitability of eurozone membership for Italy's economy. The PD's clear electoral  victory over M5S and Forza Italia gives Renzi a re-enforced mandate. We view  this as credit positive as it should provide further momentum to Renzi's  previously stated economic reform agenda.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's centre-right PP also topped the polls,  securing 26% of the vote, against the opposition Socialists' 23%.  This result  is striking because the PP has been at the helm since late 2011, overseeing  drastic fiscal tightening and politically challenging reform. The relatively  strong economic improvement in recent quarters is also likely to have  contributed.  In both Greece and Portugal the ruling party lost by aabout four percentage  points to the main opposition. Considering the scale of the austerity measures  imposed under the bailout programmes, this shows there has not been a large  electoral backlash against fiscal and economic reform.  In Greece, the ruling centre-right ND polled 23% against left-wing opposition  SYRIZA's 27%, although the (purely illustrative) combined vote share of the  ruling ND/PASOK coalition exceeded this figure. The better-than-expected 8% vote  for the PASOK-led centre-left grouping should provide some stability to the  Greek coalition in the near term. In Portugal, the PSD/CDS-PP coalition that has  been in power for the past three years of the bailout programme received 28% of  the vote, behind the centre-left opposition Socialist Party's 31% but not out of  contention.  The easing of the eurozone crisis and the recovery of some individual sovereigns  has been reflected in a number of positive rating actions for sovereigns in the  periphery this year, most recently in Greece, which we upgraded to 'B' from 'B-'  last week.
