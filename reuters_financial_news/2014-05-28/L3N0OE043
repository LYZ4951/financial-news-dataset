May 27 (Reuters) - Britain's major cinema chains have banned all adverts on the Scottish independence referendum after customers inundated them with complaints, the Guardian reported late Tuesday.

The Odeon and Vue [TERA.UL] cinema chains told the Guardian that all the major chains, including the Cineworld Group <CINE.L> and United Cinemas International, had taken a collective decision to ban all referendum advertising from June 5, a week into the four-month-long official campaign. The newspaper said the campaigns for and against Scottish independence were notified of the ban last week.

Along with the other leading cinema exhibitors, we will not be continuing with any additional campaigns beyond 5 June," a Vue spokeswoman told the Guardian.
