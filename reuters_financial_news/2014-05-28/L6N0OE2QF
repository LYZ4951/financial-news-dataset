STOCKHOLM, May 28 (Reuters) - Sweden should introduce rules to require mortgage borrowers to pay down their loans instead of just paying interest, central bank governor Stefan Ingves said on Wednesday.

Authorities in Sweden are concerned about growing household debt levels - among the highest in Europe - and have introduced a number of measures aimed at cooling the housing market in recent years. Ingves said more needed to be done. "The natural step would be to require amortisation of loans," Ingves said in the text of a speech published on the central bank's website. "The stock of existing mortgages would then decline. This would, moreover, give households stronger incentives to borrow less." Currently, many Swedes only pay interest on their mortgages. The Riksbank recently published a study that said that Swedish low- and middle-income wage earners are deeper in debt than previously thought, adding to concerns among several central bankers.

Ingves said there was no time to delay taking more measures to deal with the problem, saying that if indebtedness and housing prices kept on increasing they would gradually reach levels that involved even greater risks and left the economy more sensitive to shocks.
