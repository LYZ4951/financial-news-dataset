ROME, May 28 (Reuters) - Italy said on Wednesday it was seeking billion euro pay-outs from multinational drug companies following a ruling by the country's anti-trust authority that their unfair policies had been detrimental to Italy's national health service.

The health ministry said in a statement it was requesting damages totalling 1.2 billion euros from Novartis <NOVN.VX> and Roche <ROGPHF.UL> for the damages incurred in 2012-2014, and was requesting 14 million euros from Pfizer. It cited several recent anti-trust rulings that the companies' repeated anti-competition policies had caused the national health service "considerable damage."
