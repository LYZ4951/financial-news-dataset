MOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM> <SBNCyq.L>, Russia's biggest bank by assets, is expected to post an 11.6 percent fall in first-quarter earnings due to increased provisions for loan losses following the Ukraine crisis and as Russia's economy deteriorates, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.

State-controlled Sberbank - widely viewed as a proxy for the broader Russian economy - is expected on Thursday to post a first quarter net profit of 78.2 billion roubles ($2.3 billion), the poll showed. A year ago it posted a profit of 88.5 billion roubles.  Provisions are expected to more than double to 74.5 billion roubles.  Russia's No.2 lender VTB <VTBR.MM> on Tuesday reported a plunge in its net profit and a rise in bad loan provisions, showing the economic pain being inflicted by the Ukraine crisis. It also said it was working with the government on a plan to boost banks' capital and lending. [ID nL6N0OD1LG]   Below are forecasts for Sberbank's first-quarter results, in billions of roubles:
