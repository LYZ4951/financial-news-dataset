BANGKOK, May 28 (Reuters) - Thai shares traded near a one-week high on Wednesday as investors picked up stocks on hopes of a recovery in the domestic economy while other Southeast Asian indexes followed regional stocks higher after strong economic data from the United States.

The SET index <.SETI> was up 1.1 percent at 1,407.44 points at midday, its highest since May 22. Airports of Thailand <AOT.BK>, retailer CP All <CPALL.BK> and Ch Karnchang <CK.BK> were among the actively-traded stocks. "There are signs the market is beginning to factor in the new political post-coup era under Army Chief Prayuth Chan-ocha and his plans to revive the economy. However, it will take some time before confidence is completely restored," broker Krungsri Securities said in a report. A new round of speculative buying was likely to drive the index up to the 1,425 level in coming days, it added. Thailand's trade shrank in April and factory output fell for a 13th straight month, underscoring the damage political unrest has caused and the tough job the new military government faces in reviving an economy that contracted in the first quarter. [ID:nL3N0OC0YT] Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI>, Malaysia <.KLSE> and Indonesia all gained while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.6 percent. The Philippines <.PSI> inched up 0.1 percent ahead of GDP data for the first quarter, due on Thursday.  The Philippine economy probably grew the most among regional peers in the first three months of the year, driven by private consumption and post-typhoon rebuilding that could continue to bolster expansion ahead. [ID:nL3N0OC1AV] Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> was up 0.4 percent as retailers extended buying after a strong rally in the previous day, an analyst said. [ID:nL3N0OE13I]
