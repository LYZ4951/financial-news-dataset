STOCKHOLM, May 28 (Reuters) - Sweden needs to focus more on reducing high household debt levels and unpopular measures like cutting tax breaks on mortgage interest payments should be considered, the Green Party's economic policy spokesman told Reuters in an interview.

The Green party is expected to be part of a Social Democratic-led government after Sweden goes to the polls in September and possible problems related to household debt should be high on the agenda, Per Bolund said this week. "I believe we will take this issue more seriously than the current government has," Bolund said. "When looking at the (Alliance) government's eight years in power, it has taken decisions that have fuelled indebtedness in a very obvious way," he said, pointing to a real estate tax which was replaced by a much lower, capped fee, as an example. Reinstating real estate tax is not on the table, however.  Bolund said tax breaks on interest payments were another measure fuelling household debt, although the Greens had no definite proposals for cutting them and did not want to "pull the economic rug" from under households' feet. "But it is something that we are also interested in talking about: are there any possibilities to make changes in that system?" he said. The Green Party is also open for discussions about making it mandatory to pay off the principal on debt as many Swedes pay only interest on their mortgages and pay down their mortgages very slowly or not at all. But he said Sweden needed to tread carefully with regulation to let the steam out of the housing market rather than causing a rapid readjustment. The central bank has said for years that more regulation is needed in order to stop household debt - now at over 170 percent of disposable income - from continuing to rise. It has adopted a policy of "leaning against the wind" and keeping rates up to avoid further build-up of debt, drawing criticism for undershooting its primary goal of 2 percent inflation. Bolund said the central bank was right in considering indebtedness when setting rates. "I believe the Riksbank has done a good job when trying to perform that difficult balancing act." However, Bolund was open for discussing such a Federal Reserve-style dual target for the Riksbank, with inflation and employment side by side, though this should not hamper the central bank's ability to address debt when setting rates. The idea for an employment target was floated by the Social Democratic leader Stefan Lofven in a Reuters interview earlier in May. [ID:nL6N0NT5QO] The Green Party is part of the centre-left opposition led by the Social Democrats. With general elections looming in September, the opposition is in a solid lead, with recent opinion polls showing the opposition roughly 10-15 percent ahead of the current centre-right government.
