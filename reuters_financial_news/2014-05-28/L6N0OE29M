MOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Lukoil <LKOH.MM>, Russia's second largest oil producer, is expected to post $2.15 billion in first-quarter net profit, down 17 percent year-on-year largely due to foreign exchange losses, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Wednesday.

In the first quarter of last year, Lukoil, where the largest shareholders are executives Vagit Alekperov and Leonid Fedun, posted $2.58 billion in net profit. "We anticipate weaker net income mostly because of pressure from the FX loss and a higher effective income tax rate," Alfa Bank said in a research note. The rouble has been under pressure this year mostly due to the Ukraine crisis, with the West imposing sanctions on some Russian firms and individuals following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in March.  Lukoil, which has the largest foreign exposure among Russian energy companies, or its executives are not on the sanctions list but analysts will focus on the company's operations abroad during a conference call on Thursday. "Investors will also likely have questions on the prospects of Lukoil's operations abroad (upstream in Iraq, Egypt, CIS, etc., as well as a number of refineries in Europe) in the event of more severe sanctions against Russia," Alfa Bank said. Below are forecasts for Lukoil's first-quarter results, in billions of U.S. dollars.
