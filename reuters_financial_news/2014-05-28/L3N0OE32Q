May 28 (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc <MA.N>, the world's second largest debit and credit card company, said it was extending its zero liability policy in the United States to include all PIN-based and ATM transactions.

Zero liability protection means the account holder will not be held responsible for unauthorized transactions.
