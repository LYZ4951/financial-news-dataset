MADRID, May 28 (Reuters) - Testa <TST.MC>, the real estate holding company of Spanish builder Sacyr <SCYR.MC>, said on Wednesday that it was looking to increase its free-float and would seek shareholder approval at a meeting in June to raise capital.

The company, which is currently 99.5 percent owned by Sacyr, said it had hired JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> to advise it on a potential capital raising.  Testa had previously disclosed it was studying a capital hike of up to 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) to bring in new investors, in an operation that would also involve a special dividend, the bulk of which would go to its main investor.
