DUBLIN, May 28 (Reuters) - Irish house prices rose by 1.4 percent month-on-month in April and were 8.5 percent higher than a year ago as another uptick in Dublin pushed the national figures up, the central statistics office said on Wednesday.

Prices have halved since 2008 in a property crash that devastated the economy and forced the government to pour billions of euros into the country's banks but have begun to recover over the past two years, particularly in Dublin.
