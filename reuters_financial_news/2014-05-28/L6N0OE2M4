LJUBLJANA, May 28 (Reuters) - Bad loans in Slovenian banks, which were rescued by a government financial injection last year, rose to almost 6 billion euros in March from 5.8 billion in February, the central bank said in a report on Wednesday.

Slovenia, a member of the euro zone, narrowly avoided an international bailout last year by pumping some 3.3 billion euros of its own funds in local banks in December, to save them from collapsing under bad loans.
