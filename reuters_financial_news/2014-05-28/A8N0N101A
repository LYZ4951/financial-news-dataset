ATHENS, May 28 (Reuters) - National Bank (NBG) <NBGr.AT>, Greece's largest lender by assets, reported its sixth consecutive quarterly profit in January-March, helped by lower funding costs, its Turkish unit Finansbank and reduced bad-loan provisions as the pace of new credit impairments slowed.

NBG posted net profit of 181 million euros ($246 million), above market expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters were forecasting net earnings of 24 million euros on average.
