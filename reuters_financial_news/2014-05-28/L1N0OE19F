NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - Former hedge fund analyst Matthew Teeple pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a criminal conspiracy charge in connection with the 2008 takeover of a technology company.

The former Artis Capital Management analyst told U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in Manhattan that he received tips from David Riley, a former chief information officer at Foundry Networks Inc, including one about the company's pending $3 billion takeover in 2008 by Brocade Communications Systems Inc <BRCD.O>. Federal prosecutors announced criminal charges against Riley and Teeple in March 2013, saying that subsequent trades on the information led to more than $27 million of improper gains. Teeple, 42, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. "I deeply regret the role that I played in this illegal conduct," he told the judge.
