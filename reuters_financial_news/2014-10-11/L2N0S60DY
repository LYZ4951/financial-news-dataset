WASHINGTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on Saturday in Washington, where finance ministers and central bankers from around the globe are gathered.

Many of the comments come from texts that were prepared for delivery to the IMF's steering committee, the International Monetary and Financial Committee, on Saturday.  MA JUN, CHIEF ECONOMIST OF PEOPLE'S BANK OF CHINA ON PROSPECTS FOR CHINESE ECONOMY  "I think the chance of a hard landing is very low, although we worry about some downside risk like the real estate slowing down and so on. There are also growth engines, including the service sector in general, the Internet in particular ... and healthcare is rising very rapidly." ON CHINESE REAL ESTATE SECTOR "The main concern in terms of downside risk to the economy is the real estate sector ... Real estate investment accounts for 20 percent of total investment in China. This part is slowing down and obviously putting downward pressure on the economy. This trend has been pretty evident starting from early this year and now it's running about 14 percent year-on-year growth on a year -to-date basis. Some further deceleration may be possible because the public sales were pretty weak." "The leverage in the real-estate sector, in the SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and among a lot of LGFVs (local government financing vehicles) ... are too high. The leveraging is actually rising in the past few years, while the non-SEO leveraging is falling. These problems require effort for rebalancing." ON STIMULUS "At the macro level, I think we need to avoid excessive stimulus, which could increase leveraging significantly in the longer term, even though GDP growth is slowing a bit."  FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR DANIEL TARULLO ON GLOBAL ECONOMY "I am worried about growth around the world, there are more downside risks than upside risks ... Other major economies are tilting or at least showing risks that are a little bit more to the downside than to the upside and this is obviously something we have to think about in our own policies." ON STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OF U.S. ECONOMY "An aggregate demand problem is not unrelated to income distribution ... Right now the physical capital stock (of the country) is about as old as it has been in the post World War Two era ... That suggests an underinvestment." "This is not a quick turnaround."
