BERLIN, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A consortium of infrastructure investors, including the alternative investment arm of German insurance group Allianz <ALVG.DE>, has taken over British rolling stock leasing company Porterbrook Rail Finance [PTKRL.UL].

The group, which includes Australian asset manager Hastings, Canada's Alberta Investment Management Corporation and EDF Invest <EDF.PA> of France, announced the deal late on Friday without indicating the price paid. Porterbrook owns and manages about 5,900 passenger and freight vehicles, which it says represent around a third of Britain's passenger trains, and analysts have estimated its value at about 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion).  Allianz Capital Partners manages about 10 billion euros of alternative assets and is focusing on long-term stable returns from investments in infrastructure and renewable energy. The transaction is expected to close by the end of October, the consortium said in a statement.
