WARSAW, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Poland's Bank BGZ <BGZ.WA> will issue shares worth 2.24 billion zlotys ($676 million) to merge with BNP Paribas' <BNPP.PA> Polish unit following BNP's acquisition of BGZ, the lenders said.

BGZ will issue almost 28.1 million shares to BNP Paribas Polska <BNP.WA> owners, who are to receive 5 new shares for every 6 shares in BNP Paribas Polska, which has a market value of 2.13 billion zlotys.  BNP, France's biggest listed bank, last month completed the purchase of BGZ from Dutch Rabobank [RABO.UL] for 4.5 billion zlotys as it seeks to expand in faster-growing markets.
