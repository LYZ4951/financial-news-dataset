DUBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU> (ENBD) will price a bond offering denominated in New Zealand dollars later on Monday after releasing price guidance for the transaction, a document from lead managers said.

Dubai's largest lender has set initial price thoughts for the 100 million New Zealand dollar ($77.6 million) issue of five years duration at 165 basis points over New Zealand midswaps, the document showed. ANZ <ANZ.AX> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> have been picked to arrange the bond sale, which will price during London business hours.
