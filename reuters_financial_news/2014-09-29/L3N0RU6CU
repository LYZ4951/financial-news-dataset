SYDNEY, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen dipping on Tuesday as Wall Street fell overnight and iron ore continued to be pressured. Investors will also eye a manufacturing survey from China due later in the day, as well as pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> dipped 0.2 percent to 5,252, a 12.2-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark fell 0.9 percent on Monday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was flat at 5,260.7 in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended lower on Monday following protests in Hong Kong that added to worries about Chinese growth, but the market ended well off its lows. * Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters blocked Hong Kong streets in the early hours on Tuesday, maintaining pressure on China as it faces one of its biggest political challenges since the Tiananmen Square crackdown 25 years ago. [ID:nL3N0RU5EJ] * Steel and iron ore futures in China fell to their lowest ever overnight, extending steep losses this month caused by abundant supply and slow demand ahead of the week-long National Day holiday that kicks off on Wednesday.
