DUBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Egypt's stock market rebounded from a profit-taking bout on Monday after the Cairo government announced ambitious plans to develop the refining and petrochemicals sectors and awarded fresh licences to foreign energy companies.

The Cairo index <.EGX30> rose 1.8 percent after oil minister Sherif Ismail told Reuters on Sunday that Egypt would spend $14.5 billion over the next five years to overcome an energy crisis that has led to near-daily power cuts and hit company profits. [ID:nL6N0RT0QP] He also said the government was considering floating stakes in some state-owned oil companies on the stock exchange. Separately, United Arab Emirates energy firm Dana Gas <DANA.AD> said it had been awarded concessions for two onshore gas blocks in Egypt, and a source in the state-run Egyptian Natural Gas Holding company (EGAS) told Reuters that French oil major Total <TOTF.PA> had been awarded a licence to explore for natural gas in the Nile Delta. [ID:nL6N0RU18E] [ID:nL6N0RU0GR] Shares in steelmaker Ezz Steel <ESRS.CA> rose 2.0 percent to 18.70 Egyptian pounds after Ci Capital raised its price target for the stock to 23.50 pounds from 21.50 pounds with an "overweight" rating. Developer SODIC <OCDI.CA> surged its daily limit of 10 percent ahead of the listing of its rights issue. Saudi Arabia's bourse <.TASI> also started recovering after several days of profit-taking and added 0.8 percent. Banks were the main drivers of the rise as Bank Albilad <1140.SE> jumped 5.2 percent and Banque Saudi Fransi <1050.SE> added 2.8 percent. Trading volume, however, was relatively low, reflecting the pre-holiday mood. Bourses in Saudi Arabia and Oman be will closed next week for Eid al-Adha and, although other markets may take shorter breaks - Egypt will close on Oct. 5-8 - some individual investors in them may stay away from the market for a few extra days.  UAE, KUWAIT Dubai's bourse <.DFMGI> see-sawed in low-volume trading and eventually edged up 0.1 percent amid a mixed performance by major stocks. Lenders Emirates NBD and Dubai Islamic Bank <DISB.DU> were the main support, adding 0.7 and 0.5 percent respectively. Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU>, the emirate's largest listed developer, fell 0.9 percent after its malls unit announced the final price of its initial public offer. [ID:nL6N0RU0BV] As expected, the IPO priced at the top of the proposed range amid massive demand from investors, giving an overall sale value of 5.8 billion dirhams ($1.58 billion) and making it the largest stock offer in a Gulf Arab economy since 2008. "People are just getting ready for the Eid vacation," said Harshjit Oza, property and banking analyst at Naeem Brokerage in Cairo. Abu Dhabi's bourse <.ADI> edged up 0.5 percent. Dana Gas jumped 3.0 percent after announcing the Egyptian deal. Profit-taking, in the meantime, appeared to be shifting to previously resilient Kuwait, where the main index <.KWSE> fell 0.7 percent, ending a three-week uptrend. Markets in Qatar <.QSI> and Oman <.MSI> were nearly flat.  MONDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS  DUBAI * The index <.DFMGI> inched up 0.1 percent to 4,998 points.
