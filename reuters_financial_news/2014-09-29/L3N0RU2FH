SEOUL, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> fell nearly 1 percent on Monday to its lowest close since April 7, as the dollar resumed its broad rally on robust U.S. data and reached a four-year high against a basket of major currencies.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,053.8 to the dollar at the conclusion of onshore trade compared to Friday's close of 1,044.4, breaching a key psychological resistance level of 1,050. South Korean shares edged lower on Monday, as a tepid industrial profit report over the weekend continued a string of lacklustre data from China, South Korea's largest export destination. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> edged 0.25 percent lower to close at 2,026.60 points.
