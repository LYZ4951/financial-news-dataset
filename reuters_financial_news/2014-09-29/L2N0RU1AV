WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators charged two former Wells Fargo <WFC.N> employees with insider trading on Monday, saying they traded ahead using unpublished research analyst reports that discussed upcoming credit-ratings changes.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said former Wells Fargo analyst Gregory Bolan Jr tipped former trader Joseph Ruggieri about the upcoming upgrades and downgrades in various ratings. Ruggieri in turn was able to make more than $117,000 in profits, the agency said. The two ex-employees are expected to contest the charges in the SEC's administrative court.
