HONG KONG, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's de facto central bank said that 44 branches, offices or ATMs of 23 banks had temporarily shut as of 3 p.m. on Monday amid growing civil unrest in the city.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the figures were higher than the morning due to additional suspensions in the Mong Kok and Causeway Bay areas beyond the main financial district.
