FRANKFURT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Pimco is bracing for investors to pull out money following the sudden departure of its co-founder Bill Gross but expects the vast majority of clients to stick with the firm and is confident it can handle any outflows, the California-based investment group's chief executive said.

"Should our revenues fall, and frankly we anticipate heightened redemptions here in the early stages - that's to be expected with any transition of a senior person - we're ready for that," Pimco CEO Doug Hodge told analysts on a conference call on Monday, adding that the firm had "ample liquidity".
