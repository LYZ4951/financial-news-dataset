RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Loan disbursements at Brazil state development bank BNDES slipped 5 percent in the first eight months of the year, although a slight recovery took place in the third quarter, the chief of the bank said on Monday.

The bank, Brazil's main source of long-term credit for corporations, witnessed requests recover "a little" between August and September, president Luciano Coutinho said at an event in Rio de Janeiro.
