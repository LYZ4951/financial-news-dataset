NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures are pointing to a solidly lower open on Monday, but if recent trends hold, investors may use the decline as an opportunity to add to positions.

The S&P 500 hasn't had a correction - defined as a 10 percent pullback from a peak - since 2012. While the benchmark index has had multiple pullbacks of much smaller magnitudes, profit hunting has prevented steeper losses, a strategy Oppenheimer endorsed in a note to clients on Monday. "Our tactical recommendation is to buy pullbacks in the S&P 500 because the longer term evidence remains bullish, in our view," the firm wrote. Though positive on stocks in the long term, Oppenheimer said near-term conditions were unfavorable because investor expectations were overly high, and because fewer stocks were making new highs. The firm expects a pullback of 5 to 7 percent. "We view the [S&P] index's trend as positive as long as 1,900 support is upheld, and expect higher highs once near-term conditions strengthen," it wrote. The S&P closed Friday at 1,982.85. Futures snapshot at 8:22: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> were falling 12.5 points, or 0.63 percent, with 198,619 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> were down 26 points, or 0.64 percent, in volume of 35,340 contracts.
