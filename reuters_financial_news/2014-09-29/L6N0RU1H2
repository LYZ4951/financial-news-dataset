COPENHAGEN, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Torm <TORM.CO> has received a proposal for a "specific restructuring agreement" from a group of its lenders and private equity fund Oaktree Capital Management [OAKCP.UL], the Danish shipping company said on Monday.

Shares in Torm are traded 9.5 percent higher at 0850 GMT, outperforming a flat Danish stock market. Investor relations chief Christian Soegaard-Christensen told Reuters the following:  ON DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT "It's a transaction in which Oaktree as a large private equity investor with experiences within shipping has said it wishes to recapitalise the company, and the banks have said they believe it's a good plan. They have agreed on a basis for a contract that the company is now evaluating together with the remaining creditors. "We've now received the proposal and we are evaluating it with the other parties at the negotiating table. Once we have done that we will say more about why we are doing A or B."  ON WHETHER THE PROPOSAL SECURES TORM AS INDEPENDENT COMPANY "Yes. You can say that. It is a restructuring solution for the company, which means it would become a company with a normalised capital structure."  ON OAKTREE'S ROLE "Oaktree is a large and significant investor, which already cooperates with Torm, as we manage more than 20 ships for them commercially and/or technically. "Oaktree will be a cornerstone investor in this proposal." ON WHEN MORE NEWS WILL BE ANNOUNCED
