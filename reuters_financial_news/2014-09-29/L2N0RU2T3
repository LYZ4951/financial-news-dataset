LIMA, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Peru's central bank on Monday said it will lower the reserve requirement for deposits held in soles to 10.5 percent from 11 percent starting in October.

The central bank has loosened reserve rules several times over the past year to boost liquidity in the local currency and to encourage sluggish economic growth.
