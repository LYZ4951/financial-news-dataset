BANGKOK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Thai stocks snapped eight sessions of gains on Monday as disappointing August exports data fuelled late selling in an overbought market, while most others in Southeast Asia were flat-to-weaker amid weakness in regional currencies.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> closed down 0.9 percent after rallying 2.2 percent in the previous eight trading sessions. Large-caps fell on strong volume, including Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK>, Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> and PTT <PTT.BK>. The index closed at 1,585.79, down from Friday's close of 1,600.16, which sent its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) to 71.9. A reading above 70 indicates an overbought market. "The trade data added to an already weak market sentiment as we also had a technical-led selling around the 1,600 level," said Viwat Techapoonphol, a senior strategist at Tisco Securities. Thai exports in August suffered the biggest percentage drop since bad flooding in late 2011, confirming that a key engine of the country's economy was not firing. [ID:nL3N0RR479] Indonesian shares <.JKSE> edged higher, rebounding from a more than seven-week low hit earlier, while Philippine shares <.PSI> were flat amid foreign-led selling in telecoms stocks such as Globe Telecom <GLO.PS>.
