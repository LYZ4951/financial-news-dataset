LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Aberdeen Asset Management <ADN.L> said assets under management rose 3 percent to 331.2 billion pounds ($537.60 billion) at end-August, boosted by performance and favourable foreign exchange moves, and a slowdown in the pace of outflows.

That compared with AuM of 322.5 billion at end-June. Net outflows during the two months to Aug. 31 moderated to 1.7 billion from the 8.8 billion pound seen in the three months to end-June, it said in a statement on Monday. Market movements added 7.9 billion pounds in assets between June and August, with foreign exchange effects adding a further 2.5 billion pounds. Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen, said: "Our equity capabilities are recovering, both in terms of performance and flows following a tough 2013. It's also encouraging that our marketing focus on non-equity products is gaining traction, particularly in terms of property and emerging market debt." Emerging market debt and property products each contributed net inflows of over 1 billion pounds in the first 11 months of the financial year, it said.
