HONG KONG, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Charles Li, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) <0388.HK>, on Monday urged pro-democracy protesters to use peaceful means within the boundaries of the law to voice their concerns.

Hong Kong democracy protesters defied volleys of tear gas and police baton-charges to stand firm in the centre of the global financial hub in one of the biggest political challenges for Beijing since the Tiananmen Square crackdown 25 years ago.
