LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> said on Monday it had dismissed eight staff following an investigation into the submission of benchmark interest rates after it was fined in July by American and British regulators.

Lloyds, which is 25 percent owned by the British government, said around 3 million pounds ($4.9 million) in unpaid bonuses had been forfeited as a result of the action.
