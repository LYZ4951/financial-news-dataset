ZURICH, Sept 29 (Reuters) - UBS said on Monday some authorities have started talks about a possible resolution of a probe into alleged collusion and price-manipulation in the global currency market.

The talks looked at whether UBS had inadequate controls and could involve material monetary penalties, the bank said in a prospectus for a share-swap published on Monday.
