SAO PAULO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's main economic policy body eased on Monday some rules governing foreign investment on local depositary receipts, in a move aimed at kick starting a largely dormant market.

The Monetary Policy Council decided that non-resident investors' purchases of Brazilian depositary receipts, known as BDRs, could also be made from a local Brazilian account and not only from a foreign account. In a statement, the council, known as CMN, will allow BDRs to be linked to financial assets other than stocks exclusively.
