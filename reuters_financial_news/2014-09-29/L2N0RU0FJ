NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - DreamWorks Animation SKG <DWA.O> and Athlon Energy <ATHL.N> were among the biggest movers in the premarket session on Monday, with both names rallying on deal news.

Shares of DreamWorks soared after a person with knowledge of the situation said Japan's SoftBank Corp <9984.T> was in talks to buy the company. The talks were first reported by the Hollywood Reporter, which quoted an unidentified source as saying a buyout would value DreamWorks at $3.4 billion. [ID:nL2N0RT05R] The film studio's share price surged 23 percent to $27.50 and was one of the Nasdaq's most active premarket names. If the scale of the rally holds, it will be the biggest one-day advance for the stock since April 2009. Despite that, the rally will not be enough to push the stock into positive territory for the year; it is down 37 percent in 2014. On the New York Stock Exchange, Athlon jumped 24.5 percent to $58.18 after Encana Corp <ECA.TO> agreed to buy the company for $5.93 billion in cash. [ID:nL3N0RU3XZ] Athlon is on track to have its biggest one-day advance in its history, and the stock has been a strong performer this year, up almost 55 percent.  Futures snapshot at 7:47 a.m. EDT: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> were falling 12 points, or 0.61 percent, with 178,153 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> were down 25.5 points, or 0.63 percent, in volume of 31,737 contracts.
