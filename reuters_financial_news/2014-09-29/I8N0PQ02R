MUMBAI, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Monday as rate-sensitive firms such as ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> fell a day ahead of the central bank's policy review, although exporters gained after the rupee weakened.

[MKTS/GLOB]   ICICI Bank provisionally closed 1.3 percent lower, while HDFC Bank Ltd <HDBK.NS> fell 0.6 percent. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd <SUN.NS> rose 3.6 percent, while Tata Consultancy Services Ltd <TCS.NS> ended higher 3.3 percent.
