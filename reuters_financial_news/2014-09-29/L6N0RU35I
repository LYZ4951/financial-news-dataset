MILAN, Sept 29 (Reuters) - French financier Vincent Bollore has increased his stake in Italy's Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> to 7.5 percent from 7 percent, the investment bank said on Monday.

Bollore, who holds the stake through holding company Financiere Du Perguet, has been allowed to increase his stake to up to 8 percent after French insurer Groupama [GRPMHA.UL]  withdrew from a shareholder pact last year. Members of the pact - which has a combined stake of around 31.5 percent in the bank - on Monday unanimously approved a list of candidates for the bank's new board of directors, which will be voted on at a shareholder meeting on Oct. 28.  The pact put forward Maurizia Angelo Comneno as one of two deputy chairs, making it the first time a woman could hold such a position at the investment bank. Renato Pagliaro was confirmed in the candidate list as chairman, Alberto Nagel as chief executive and Marco Tronchetti Provera - head of tyre maker Pirelli <PECI.MI> - as the other deputy chair.
