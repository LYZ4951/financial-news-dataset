FRANKFURT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Swedish activist investor Cevian has increased its stake in German industrial services and building firm Bilfinger <GBFG.DE> to 25.6 percent, Bilfinger said on Monday.

Bilfinger earlier this month issued its third profit warning since the end of June, after ousting Roland Koch, a former premier of the German regional state of Hesse, as chief executive. [ID:nL5N0R527Y]
