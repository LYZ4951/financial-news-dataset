LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Santander UK has appointed Nathan Bostock as chief executive, handing the former Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> finance director the task of overseeing a planned listing on the London Stock Exchange.

Bostock, 53, succeeds Ana Botin, who was appointed chairwoman of the bank's Spanish parent Santander Group <SAN.MC> following the death of her father Emilio Botin earlier this month. Bostock takes up the role with immediate effect. Ana Botin will stay on the board of Santander UK as a non-executive director.
