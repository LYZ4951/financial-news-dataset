JOHANNESBURG, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Capitec Bank Holdings' <CPIJ.J> first-half earnings rose by an expected 21 percent after the South African mass-market lender attracted more customers and booked higher transaction income.

Diluted headline earnings totalled 1,015 cents in the six-months to end-August, from 838 cents a year earlier. Capitec, which offers high-interest loans to low-income South Africans, said income from lending rose 13 percent to 5.2 billion rand ($462 million). However, write offs increased to 2.1 billion rand, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. The bank said it increased provisions by 199 million rand to cover potential weakness in its book. Another unsecured lender, African Bank <ABLJ.J>, was rescued earlier this year after mounting bad debt sunk it. Capitec said net transaction fee income jumped 34 percent to 1.2 billion rand following its push to enlist higher-income customers. Active users increased by more than 400,000 to 5.8 million.
