Sept 29 (Reuters) - Short-seller Citron Research accused software maker Textura Corp <TXTR.N> of making fraudulent claims about gross margins for its flagship product, its total addressable market, and of keeping a lawsuit under wraps, sending its shares down sharply.

Textura, which makes on-demand project management software to help commercial construction businesses, did not immediately answer calls or reply to email requests for comment. Textura' shares fell as much as 16 percent to $23.65 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday after the release of the Citron report. (http://bit.ly/1sL1rDA) Citron previously targeted Textura in December, accusing it of lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission about the involvement of Chief Executive Patrick Allin in a "pump-and-dump" stock market scheme.
