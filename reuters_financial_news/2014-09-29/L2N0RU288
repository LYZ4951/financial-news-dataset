NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Monday following protests in Hong Kong that added to worries about Chinese growth and after a disappointing forecast from Ford Motor Co<F.N>.

The S&P consumer discretionary sector<.SPLRCD>, down 0.6 percent, had the most losses. Ford shares fell 7.5 percent and the stock was the S&P's biggest percentage decliner after it lowered its outlook late during the session, saying North American margins will be at the low end of its previous guidance.[ID:nL2N0RU1VA] But the market ended well off its lows as worries about tensions in Hong Kong started the day off with losses of nearly 1 percent. "The market continues to get hit with a lot of negative news, and the latest was the problems in Hong Kong," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. But investors might take a more upbeat view of the market heading into the fourth quarter and ahead of third-quarter earnings, he said. "Seasonally, we're entering perhaps a favorable period for the equity market," Hellwig added. The Dow Jones Industrial average <.DJI> fell 41.93 points, or 0.25 percent, to 17,071.22; the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 5.05 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,977.8; and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 6.34 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,505.85. The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Athlon Energy Inc<ATHL.N>, which rose 24.80 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was Civeo Corp<CVEO.N>, down 49.59 percent. Besides Ford, the most active shares on the NYSE included Brazil's Petrobras <PBR.N>, down 10.69 percent to $14.70. On the Nasdaq, Tibco Software Inc <TIBX.O>, up 21.2 percent at $23.65; Apple Inc<AAPL.O>, down 0.6 percent at $100.11, and Zynga Inc<ZNGA.O>, down 1.4 percent at $2.79, were among the most actively traded.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,801 to 1,271, for a 1.42-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,502 issues fell and 1,183 advanced for a 1.27-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
