SOFIA, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The results of Bulgaria's general election point to a heavy defeat for the Socialists, a party spokesman told reporters on Sunday evening.

Exit polls suggested the Socialists had won about 16 percent of the vote, around half the tally of the centre right GERB party, their main opponents. A Socialist-led coalition governed Bulgaria until its collapse in July.
