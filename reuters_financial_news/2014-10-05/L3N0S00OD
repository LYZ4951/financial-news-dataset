MELBOURNE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to drift lower on Monday, with miners under pressure from weak iron ore and coal prices and trading likely to be thinned by a public holiday in half the country.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> inched up 0.1 percent to 5,322.0, settling at a 3.8-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>. The benchmark rose 0.4 percent on Friday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.2 percent to 5,247.6 in early trade. * On Wall Street, the S&P 500 <.SPX> posted its best day since August on Friday following a stronger-than-expected September U.S. jobs report that bolstered the outlook for the U.S. economy. * Copper and aluminium bounced on Friday, a day after touching multi-month lows, but traders said the move may not last as investors remained worried about a strong dollar and weaker demand in top metals consumer China. * Top global miner BHP Billiton <BHP.AX> will be in the frame on Monday as it updates investors on its iron ore expansion and cost-cutting progress.  * National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> said it expects to raise between $336 million and $384 million through an initial public offering of a 27.6 percent stake in its U.S. subsidiary Great Western Bank.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2138 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1967.9   1.12%21.730 USD/JPY <JPY=>   109.71  0% 0.000 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.4358  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1190.6   0.00% 0.000 US CRUDE<CLc1>   89.74   -1.40%-1.270 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   17009.69 1.24%208.64 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  144.62   0.79%  1.14 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St rallies; S&P 500 posts best day since August[.N]   * Oil shaves $1, retreats on dollar spike[O/R]   * Gold falls 1.8 pct after payrolls [GOL/]   * Copper, aluminium bounce, but remain vulnerable  [MET/L]  DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
