DUBAI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Bahraini sovereign fund Mumtalakat [BHMUT.UL] has set price guidance for its planned up-to-$600 million sukuk issue, which is due to be sold later on Tuesday, a document from lead managers said.

The seven-year deal is set to price at 220 basis points over midswaps, the document said, well inside the 237.5 bps area over the same benchmark which was earmarked on Monday. [ID:nL6N0T72ZY] Order books are in excess of $1.5 billion, the document added.
