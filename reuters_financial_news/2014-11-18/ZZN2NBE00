SHANGHAI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares fell again on Tuesday, as investors took profits from the landmark Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect scheme.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> unofficially closed down 1.1 percent, at 23,529.17 points. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> fell 1.2 percent, to 10,426.11 points. Analysts said the market was focusing on fundamentals again after the excitement the previous day for the launch of the cross-border scheme. On Monday, though, the Hang Seng fell 1.2 percent.
