HONG KONG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Foreign buyers took up only 37 percent or 4.8 billion yuan($784.4 million) of their 13 billion yuan daily quota of Shanghai stocks on Tuesday, a day after fully utilising the available daily quotas as investors gave a relatively cautious response to the second day of a landmark scheme connecting the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets.

Trading was more orderly on Tuesday compared with the brisk trading on Monday where a daily investment quota of 13 billion yuan for Shanghai stocks was quickly exhausted as international investors made a beeline for mainland markets.
