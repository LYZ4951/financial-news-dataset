NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Bank of America's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch said Tuesday it hired two financial advisers away from rival firms Raymond James Financial <RJF.N> and JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>.

In San Antonio, Texas, broker Ricardo Guerrero joined Merrill Lynch from Chase Private Client, JPMorgan Chase's investing channel located at its bank branches. With JPMorgan Chase Private Client, he managed $100 million in client assets and generated about $900,000 in annual revenue.  A Raymond James spokeswoman confirmed Higgenbotham left the firm but declined to comment further. A J.P. Morgan spokesman declined to comment on Guerrero's departure.
