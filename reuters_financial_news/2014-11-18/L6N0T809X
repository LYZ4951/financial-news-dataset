DUBAI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Middle East bourses may stabilise on Tuesday after U.S. and European markets edged up and Japan rebounded.

Most Middle East exchanges were gloomy on Monday as a renewed slump in oil prices weighed on regional sentiment.  Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, was hit hardest and its main index <.TASI> dropped 2.8 percent to an eight-month low of 9,290 points in a broad sell-off. Investors' main concern is that Gulf governments may start to cut spending because of falling oil prices, which would affect corporate earnings across the board. However, Monday's sell-off appeared to be a knee-jerk reaction because analysts so far remain bullish on key stocks such as Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) <2010.SE> which has a median target price of 131.50 riyals and closed at 98.82 riyals on Monday. The median target for large lender Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, which closed at 62.24 riyals, is 76.00 riyals. Other markets in the region could also stabilise or rebound. "Here in Egypt, we also saw some profit-booking," said Harshjit Oza, assistant director of research at Naeem brokerage in Cairo. "The correction was quite expected and overall the earnings season is going quite well."
