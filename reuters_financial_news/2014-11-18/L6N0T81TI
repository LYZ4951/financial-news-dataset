BRDO PRI KRANJU, Slovenia, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The privatisation of state companies, foreign investment and reducing companies' debt burden are important in stabilising Slovenia's banks, the head of the country's central bank said on Tuesday.

"If we boost credit demand ... without addressing the large sectoral and aggregate imbalances of the economy ... we may end up sowing the seeds of another financial crisis," said European Central Bank Governing Council member Bostjan Jazbec. "Privatisation and entry of private investors should be the key vehicles for the required non-debt capital infusion," he told an audience of bankers.
