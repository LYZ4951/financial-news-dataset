BAKU, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's central bank wants to buy $1 billion worth of Asian government bonds, the bank's deputy head, Aftandil Babayev, said on Tuesday.

"$500 million will be invested in the Chinese market on the basis of a mutual agreement, while another $500 million will be invested in other markets in Asia with the help of foreign managers," Babayev told reporters.  Babayev named Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea as countries of interest, adding that Amundi, Eastspring Investments and Western Asset Management would manage the process. He did not give any other details on the plan, which would be the first such purchases for the Azeri central bank.
