Nov 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N>, which was not part of last week's international settlement over allegations of manipulation in the foreign exchange market, dismissed a former HSBC trader for his alleged involvement in the manipulation, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Frank Cahill, who was asked to leave Goldman Sachs' London offices on Tuesday, worked as a currencies trader at HSBC Holdings PLC <HSBA.L> before joining Goldman Sachs in 2012, the report said, citing a person familiar with the matter. (http://on.wsj.com/1F0rDwm) "This relates to a period before he joined Goldman Sachs and he has now left the firm," a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said. The dismissal came a week after regulators imposed fines totaling $4.3 billion on HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc <RBS.L>, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, Citigroup Inc <C.N>, UBS AG <UBSN.VX> and Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate the forex market, following a year-long global investigation.
