STOCKHOLM, Nov 18 (Reuters) - A long period of low repo rate will contribute to higher inflation but also increase risks in the economy, Swedish central bank Governor Stefan Ingves said on Tuesday in presentation material for testimony at the parliament's finance committee.

At its latest meeting in late October, Sweden's central bank cut its key rate to a record low of zero to ward off the risk of deflation also pushing back its forecast for when it would start to tighten policy to the middle of 2016. [ID:nL5N0SN1OB]
