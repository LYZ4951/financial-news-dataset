DUBAI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Bahrain sovereign fund Mumtalakat <BHMUT.UL> has narrowed guidance for an up-to-$600 million seven-year Islamic bond offering, which is expected to price later on Tuesday, a document from lead managers said.

Orders in excess of $2.5 billion helped reduce the potential cost of the sukuk to 210 basis points, plus or minus 5 bps, over midswaps, the document showed. This was inside the 220 bps over the same benchmark guidance given earlier in the day. BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T> and Standard Chartered <STAN.L> are arrangers to the deal.
