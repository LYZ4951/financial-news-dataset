Nov 18 (Reuters) - British Land Company Plc <BLND.L>, Britain's second-largest listed property developer, reported on Tuesday a 11.8 percent rise in half-year net asset value, enjoying the benefits of London's commercial property boom.

The developer of London's "Cheesegrater" skyscraper said it expected demand for office spaces in London to remain strong, as the pipeline of new space remains constrained. [ID:nRSR2687Xa]
