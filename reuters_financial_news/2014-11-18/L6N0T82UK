MOSCOW, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Tuesday it would continue to limit rouble liquidity through its repurchase agreements and foreign currency swaps.

"We do not propose to introduce legal restrictions on speculators, as we believe that does not make sense," the central bank said in e-mailed comments.
