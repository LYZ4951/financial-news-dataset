LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Major Hellenic Bank <HBNK.CY> shareholders Third Point and Wargaming are each to take a 20 percent stake in its 220 million-euro ($274.9 million) rights issue, the Cypriot lender's Chief Financial Officer told Reuters on Tuesday.

Hedge fund Third Point and Cyprus-based online game developer Wargaming will each take up the stakes as the lender seeks to wrap up its rights issue by the end of the year following the European Central Bank's stress tests, CFO Antonis Rouvas said in an interview. Both firms each held a 20.3 percent stake in the lender as of Nov. 14.  Another major existing investor, the Archbishopric of Cyprus, has not yet told the bank of its plans regarding the rights issue, he added.  Rouvas also said that Cyprus-listed Hellenic was seeking a secondary listing on a European exchange in the next two to three years, and that the board would decide more precise details on location and timing in 2016.
