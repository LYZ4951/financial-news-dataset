DUBAI, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Bahrain sovereign fund Mumtalakat [BHMUT.UL] has launched a $600 million seven-year sukuk at the tight end of its previously-marketed price range, with the sale set to complete later on Tuesday, a document from lead managers said.

The sukuk pricing was last revised to 210 basis points, plus or minus 5 bps, over midswaps, after being marketed initially at 220 bps over the same benchmark guidance. BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T> and Standard Chartered <STAN.L> are arrangers to the deal.
