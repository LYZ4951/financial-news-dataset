NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday paid investors an interest rate of 0.035 percent on the $40 billion of U.S. four-week Treasury bills it sold, which was lower than the interest rate set at an auction the prior week.

The Treasury auctioned last week's $40 billion worth of four-week or one-month T-bill supply at an interest rate of 0.045 percent which was the highest since March 25.
