PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - French prosecutors have opened a preliminary inquiry into suspected insider trading by officials at French bank BNP Paribas, a source with knowledge of inquiry said on Tuesday.

Spokespeople at the bank were not immediately available for comment. Under French law, a preliminary probe does not necessarily lead to charges or imply wrongdoing.
