NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> and the U.S. Department of Justice are "no longer as optimistic" about settling a lawsuit accusing the country's largest mortgage lender of fraud, a lawyer for the bank said on Tuesday.

Douglas Baruch, a lawyer for Wells Fargo, told a U.S. federal court judge in Manhattan that while the parties would not rule out a settlement, both sides were prepared to resume litigating after putting the case on hold since July.
