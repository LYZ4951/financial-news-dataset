PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - European stocks rose adding to the previous session's rally on Tuesday after comments from ECB President Mario Draghi that were seen as raising the prospect of further stimulus steps.

Shares in European cable and telecoms company Altice <ATCE.AS> bucked the trend, falling 3.8 percent after private equity firms Carlyle <CG.O> and Cinven <CINV.UL> sold 7.5 million shares via an accelerated bookbuild.

"Overall, sentiment has improved after Draghi's comments yesterday, which were quite dovish even though he didn't unveil anything new. The European market is clearly driven by the ECB, and the fact that Draghi reaffirms the bank's determination to support the economy is positive," said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG France. Draghi said on Monday the ECB stimulus is gaining traction but reiterated the central bank's readiness to do more if necessary.[ID:nL6N0T73XD] Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> was up 0.3 percent, France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> up 0.3 percent, Italy's MIB <.FTMIB> up 0.5 percent, and the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> index up 0.5 percent.
