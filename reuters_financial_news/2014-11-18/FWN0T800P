LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - British insurer Prudential <PRU.L> said group new business profit was up 17 percent in the year to date on a constant exchange rate basis, with UK new business profit helped by the sale of annuities to company pension schemes.

Group new business profit rose to 1.5 billion pounds ($2.35 billion) compared with 1.4 billion pounds a year earlier, Prudential said in a third quarter trading statement on Tuesday.
