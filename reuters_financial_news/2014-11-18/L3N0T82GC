SEOUL, Nov 18 (Reuters) - South Korean shares snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday to close up more than 1 percent on anticipation of more stimulus from the European Central Bank.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 1.2 percent at 1,967.01 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> fell against the dollar as expectations of more easing from Europe and Japan pushed the greenback to a fresh 4-year high against a basket of currencies.
