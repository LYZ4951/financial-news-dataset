LAGOS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> currency closed at a new low of 173.35 on Tuesday despite further central bank intervention to prop it up, dealers said.

The central bank auctioned $3 million each to commercial banks, removing a cap on the margins the lenders can make when  selling the dollars on to customers, dealers said.
