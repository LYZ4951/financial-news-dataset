LAGOS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market on Tuesday, selling dollars to lenders in a bid to boost the naira currency, dealers said.

The bank sold $3 million each to commercial lenders via bids to prop up the naira, which had lost 1.76 percent to trade at a new intraday low of 176.30 against the dollar before the intervention.
