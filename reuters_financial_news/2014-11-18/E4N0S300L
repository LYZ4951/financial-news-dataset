FLORIANOPOLIS, Brazil, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank could raise interest rates again if high inflation makes it necessary, director Carlos Hamilton Araujo said on Tuesday.

Araujo, the central bank's director of economic policy, said policymakers will not be complacent about inflation although he admitted that the economy has been growing below potential.
