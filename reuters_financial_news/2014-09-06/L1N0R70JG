AMELIA ISLAND, Fla., Sept 6 (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser said on Saturday he has doubts about proposed legislation on Capitol Hill that would force the U.S. central bank to adopt a rule-based policy in setting interest rates.

Plosser is a prominent interest-rate hawk who favors such a rule, but said he would prefer the Fed come to that decision on its own. "Whether the legislation is a good way to do that, I have my doubts. I would prefer to do it on my own," Plosser said. Legislation proposed by conservatives in Congress would require the Fed to adopt a rule to guide its interest rate decisions, and also impose stricter congressional oversight of the central bank. Plosser also said he expects U.S. job growth will rebound after a soft August reading, affirming his view that the economy is making good progress. "I prefer to look at long-term trends," he said. "Data suggest continued improvement in U.S. labor market conditions."
