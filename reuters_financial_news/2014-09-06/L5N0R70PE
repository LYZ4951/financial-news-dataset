VENICE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Swedish director Roy Andersson's offbeat, surrealist comedy "A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence" won the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday.

The award for best director went to 77-year-old Andrei Konchalovsky for his film "The Postman's White Nights". American director Joshua Oppenheimer's "The Look of Silence", a documentary about massacres in Indonesia in the 1960s following a failed communist coup, got the Jury Prize for best film.
