CERNOBBIO, Italy, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not be able to lift the stagnant euro zone economy on its own unless governments also act decisively on reforms, chairman of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Saturday.

Dijsselbloem said he backed the unexpected moves to lift growth unveiled by ECB President Mario Draghi on Thursday despite risks that an excessively loose monetary policy could soften governments' resolve to take the necessary steps. "But I think that in the present situation just these monetary measures simply won't be enough," he told reporters on the sidelines of a business conference in Italy. "The pressure is on national politicians to do the reforms we have been waiting for a long time. We can't rely just on the measures of monetary policies as they have been stretched already very far." Data published this week showed the euro zone economy stagnated in the three months to the end of June, with Italy, the bloc's third-biggest economy, back in recession for the third time since 2008. In an effort to fight too low inflation in the euro zone and promote economic growth, the ECB on Thursday cut interest rates almost to zero and pledged to buy parcels of repackaged debt in a bid to bolster lending. Dijsselbloem said governments should improve public finances in a "growth-friendly" way, promote investment spending and adopt reforms boosting competitiveness. He expressed confidence that such policies, combined with the ECB's monetary support, could bring the euro zone's economic recovery back on track. Growth in the currency bloc ground to a halt in the second quarter of 2014. Asked if Italy would be given leeway in meeting European Union budget targets, Dijsselbloem said EU rules allowed for some flexibility in the case of unexpected adverse economic conditions, but that it would be up to the Commission to decide if these applied. "I hope the draft budget will be ambitious, both in meeting fiscal targets but certainly also in terms of structural reforms, really getting them done," Dijsselbloem said.  "Then it's up to the Commission to assess those draft budgetary plans ... (though) if I understand the Italian prime minister correctly, Italy won't need flexibility because he will remain inside the targets," Dijsselbloem said.
