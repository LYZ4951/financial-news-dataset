LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Britain's prime minister pledged on Saturday to help younger people buy their first house by offering them a 20 percent discount on some properties if his party wins a national election in May.

Conservative leader David Cameron said in a tweet that first-time buyers aged under 40 would get the discount on 100,000 new homes.
