LONDON/PARIS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - French energy services firm Spie [IPO-SPIE.PA] is struggling to attract investors for its Paris listing amid tough market conditions, with books still not covered the day before the deal is due to price and start trading, two sources familiar with the matter said.

The company is planning to sell up to 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of new and existing shares on the Euronext Paris exchange, valuing it at up to 2.75 billion euros. [ID:nL6N0RU2AY]
