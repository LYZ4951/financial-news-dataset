MUMBAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Indian central bank is working on allowing settlements of government bonds in the Euroclear system, the world's biggest securities settlement system, Deputy Governor H. R. Khan said at a capital markets conference in Mumbai on Wednesday.

The move is likely to make foreign investor access to the local debt market easier and help bring in larger debt inflows.
