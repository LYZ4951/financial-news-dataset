HONG KONG, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China's Tianhe Chemicals Group <1619.HK> said trading in its shares will resume after a month-long halt following allegations from a stock researcher, as it reported a 44.3 percent rise in quarterly profit.

The company reiterated late on Wednesday accusations made by research house Anonymous Analytics that it had overstated profits in its initial public offering prospectus were wrong. "We do not have two sets of books as alleged by the reports. We regret the prolonged lack of trading liquidity in our shares that has resulted from this process," it said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Tianhe is expected to hold a press conference on Thursday morning, its first since the allegations that it falsified statements to auditors and investors ahead of its Hong Kong listing, sent its shares down 5 percent on Sept. 2 before trading was suspended at the company's request.
