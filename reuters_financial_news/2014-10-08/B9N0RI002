SHANGHAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - China's main share index hit a 20-month high in intraday trade on Wednesday, underpinned by strength in property developers after the central bank rolled out policies to boost the struggling sector.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> unofficially finished up 0.8 percent at 2,382.15 points, after hitting its highest level since February 2013 as the market resumed trade following the National Day holiday. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings gained 1.1 percent. Before the week-long break, the People's Bank of China cut mortgage rates and downpayment levels for some home buyers for the first time since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, making one of its biggest moves this year to boost an economy increasingly threatened by a sagging housing market.
