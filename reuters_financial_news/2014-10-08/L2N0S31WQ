Oct 8 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System said on Wednesday it would employ GCM Grosvenor to run its new $200 million private equity emerging manager commitment.

Calpers said the new program would launch by the end of the year via a fund-of-funds vehicle. The pension fund would also invest $100 million in AGI Resmark Housing Fund, LLC, a San Francisco Bay Area-focused multi-family residential apartment development fund. Calpers considers itself a leader in developing and implementing newly formed firms or firms raising first- or second-time funds, called emerging manager programs. Since 2010, the pension fund has committed $900 million to these types of funds. Grosvenor, a large independent alternative asset management firm, manages approximately $47 billion in assets and multiple emerging manager programs for large institutional investors, including public pension plans and corporate plans. San Francisco-based AGI Capital is an emerging manager-led real estate investment company that focuses on enhancing communities while delivering strong market returns for investors and partners. Calpers has invested nearly $12 billion with 395 emerging managers, and since 2010, the pension fund has made more than $1 billion in new commitments to emerging manager strategies.
