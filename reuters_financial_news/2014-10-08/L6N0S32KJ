COPENHAGEN, Oct 8 (Reuters) - A lobby group for the Danish banking industry has appealed directly to members of the country's parliament to postpone a decision on whether to join the EU banking union, the group said on Wednesday.

"It is the Danish Bankers Association's assessment that despite the stated advantages, there are several elements of uncertainty," the association said in a statement. The European Banking Union is expected to launch in November, with the European Central Bank taking charge of bank supervision from Helsinki to Lisbon. The aim is to restore confidence in the euro zone's banks, battered by the 2007-9 global financial crisis and the currency area's own debt crisis, and help revive lending to businesses and households, especially in stricken southern Europe. Denmark is an EU member but a euro-outsider and can make its own decision about joining the banking union. The principles and framework behind the new union are generally reasonable, but contain elements of uncertainty such as how the practical supervision and the collaboration with national supervisory authorities will function, the lobby group said. "It can be administratively heavy with a risk of double supervision and a complication of the appeals process," it said.
