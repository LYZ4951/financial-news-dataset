SEOUL, Oct 8 (Reuters) - South Korean shares fell 0.4 percent on Wednesday, echoing global market weakness, after hitting a five-month intraday low at the opening bell.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> ended down 7.6 points at 1,965.25, but slightly off the early low of 1,957.90. The South Korean won <KRW=> fell as offshore investors continued to repatriate profits into dollars, having sold over a net 1 trillion won ($931.01 million) worth of KOSPI shares over five sessions.
