SYDNEY, Oct 9 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> said on Thursday it would  post lower-than-expected cash earnings of A$5.1 billion-A$5.2 billion ($4.5 billion-$4.6 billion) for the recently ended financial year due to higher charges from its troubled UK business.

NAB, the country's fourth largest bank by market value, said the "disappointing" higher provisions related to payment protection insurance and interest rate hedging costs totalling almost A$1 billion.
