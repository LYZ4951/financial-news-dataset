SYDNEY, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to rebound from February lows on Thursday as Wall Street soared after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it would not raise rates for a "considerable time", while investors eye key local employment data due later in the day.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> climbed 1.1 percent to 5,282, a 40.7-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark fell 0.8 percent on Wednesday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.1 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks soared on Wednesday, with major indexes posting their biggest one-day jumps of 2014 after the Federal Reserve reassured investors that its next interest rate hike would not come until it deemed the economy could withstand it. * The Fed has said that it would not raise rates for a "considerable time," and in the minutes from its Sept. 16-17 meeting the U.S. central bank expressed concern that this could be interpreted "as a commitment," rather than being based on data that pointed to an economy that could grow without Fed stimulus. [ID:nL2N0S31Z8] * Iron ore for immediate delivery to China <.IO62-CNI=SI> rose 1.4 percent to $80 a tonne on Tuesday, the highest since Sept. 19, according to data complied by The Steel Index.  * Gold rose about 1 percent after the Fed minutes while copper fell, pressured by concerns about economic growth in China and Europe.  * National Australia Bank <NAB.AX. says it expects cash earnings for the year ended September 30 to be in the range of A$5.1 billion to A$5.2 billion. It describes its larger UK conduct charges and impairments in the announcements as "disappointing".  [ID:nWNBS00R9I] * Bank of Queensland Ltd <BOQ.AX> says its full-year revenues from ordinary activities was A$938.6 million compared with A$855.9 million last year. Its full-year net profit from ordinary activities after tax is up 40 percent to A$260.5 million. [ID:nWNBS00R9J] * Mirvac Group <MGR.AX> has acquired Birkenhead Point shopping centre in Sydney in a deal for consideration of A$310 million. [ID:nWNBS00R9K] * Monthly employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics is due later in the day. Australia's official statistician is making changes to employment figures for the past three months, accounting for an absence of the usual seasonal patterns.
