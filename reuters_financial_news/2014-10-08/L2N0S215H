SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - OpenView Venture Partners said it had raised a $250 million fund, its fourth, amid a strong environment for venture fundraising.

The firm focuses on enterprise software, and has backed businesses such as AtTask, a Utah-based work-management company; and Mashery, a San Francisco-based company bought by Intel Corp <INTC.O> last year that helps build applications.  Founded in Boston in 2006, OpenView last raised $200 million in 2012.
