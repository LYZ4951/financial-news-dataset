ZURICH, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Swiss biotech company Molecular Partners has priced its shares at between 28 and 35 Swiss francs in its planned flotation and expects to make its debut on the Swiss bourse on Oct. 22, the company said on Wednesday.

The price range would give Molecular Partners a stock market value of between 543 million Swiss francs ($566 million) and 679 million before an overallotment option is fully exercised.
