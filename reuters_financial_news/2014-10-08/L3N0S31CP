BANGKOK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets edged down on Wednesday amid worries about weaker global economic outlook and a fall in regional currencies but shares of Thai Airways International <THAI.BK> rallied on expectation of a fourth-quarter profit.

The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for the third time this year on Tuesday, warning of weaker growth in core euro zone countries, Japan and big emerging markets like Brazil.

Singapore's stock index <.FTSTI> fell for a second day with the local currency <SGD=D3> easing on selling from hedge funds.
