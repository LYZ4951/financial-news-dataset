WASHINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The following are highlights of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on Wednesday in Washington, where finance ministers, central bankers and other top officials are gathering.

U.S. TREASURY DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY MARK SOBEL "The U.S. economy continues to be a source of strength for the world, the IMF marked up the U.S. forecast. Real GDP rebounded in the second quarter and most forecasters are anticipating continued healthy growth in the U.S. through the end of this year and into 2015." "In contrast the global picture is far less bright. With few exceptions, growth has slowed over the course of the year and deflation has become a key risk in some parts of the world. Global growth forecasts are being marked down, and risks are to the downside. In the euro area, the protracted recovery from the Great Recession has failed to gain solid and durable momentum and inflation remains dramatically low."
