MUMBAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a third straight session on Wednesday to their lowest closing level in nearly two months as exporters slumped after weak macroeconomic data stoked worries about global economic growth.

Losses, however, were limited as cyclical stocks gained after the International Monetary Fund raised its FY15 GDP growth estimate for India to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent, raising hopes of a much-talked-about cyclical recovery in the domestic economy. The IMF on Tuesday cut its world growth forecast to 3.3 percent this year from 3.4 percent.  [ID:nL3N0S312F] Falls in software stocks were accentuated after Citigroup downgraded certain companies including Infosys <INFY.NS> ahead of its results on Friday. The downgrades, pinned to recent outperformance and valuations in the export-driven sector, sparked concerns that the July-September earnings may fail to impress heightened  expectations of investors. "A large part of today's fall is due to underperformance in the IT sector," said Vinod Nair, head of fundamental research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. Performance in the near term will depend on second-quarter earnings, which are likely to improve by 15 percent year-on-year compared with a high growth of 26 percent in the first quarter, as the rupee is weaker, Nair added.Investors were cautious ahead of the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meet due later in the day.

Both the indexes marked their second consecutive close below the 50-day moving average and lowest close since Aug. 14. Exporters led losses.
