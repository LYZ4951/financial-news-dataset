WARSAW, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Following are comments from Polish central bank governor Marek Belka on Wednesday after the bank cut the key interest rate to 2.00 percent.

The central bank statement after the decision is available at http://nbp.pl/homen.aspx?f=/en/aktualnosci/2014/mpc_2014_10_08.html  ON FURTHER RATE CUTS The decision to cut rates by 50, not 25 basis points, was not unanimous, but those who have voted in favour thought that the adjustment of the interest rates should be concentrated in time. I think that if we are to correct the level of interest rates (further), then this should be concentrated in time. We should take the decision relatively fast. We do not exclude rate cuts in following months. The aim is to remove pressure from the debt market, where as we know excessive rate cuts expectations trigger some behaviour which is not necessarily positive.
