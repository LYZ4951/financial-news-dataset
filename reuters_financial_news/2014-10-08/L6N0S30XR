NICOSIA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Cyprus' economy will shrink in 2014 by less than first thought, the island's public debt management agency said on Wednesday, revising its forecast to a 3 percent contraction in output from an earlier estimate of 3.5 percent.

It is the third such revision this year, after better than expected quarterly output figures showed the recession tapering off. But the business climate remained constrained, the agency, a division of Cyprus's finance ministry, said. "We maintain our view that growth in 2014 will remain negative, not exceeding 3 percent, and we assume a rebound in 2015 with a gradual restoration of lending at affordable rates," it said. Cyprus required a 10 billion euro international bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in 2013, contingent on it shutting down one troubled bank and forcing depositors in a second to pay to recapitalise it.  In its latest review in July, international lenders said the island nation would experience a 4.2 percent drop in output this year.
