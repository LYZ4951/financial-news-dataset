DUBAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Emerging market-focused private equity firm Abraaj Group has bought a majority stake in Liberty Star Consumer Holdings (Libstar), a South African food and personal care product manufacturer, it said on Wednesday.

Dubai-headquartered Abraaj bought shares in unlisted Libstar from its existing shareholders including Metier, Old Mutual Private Equity, Development Partners International and Lereko, it said in a statement. Abraaj said it would continue to support Libstar's pan-African growth strategy, including in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. It did not disclose the size of the deal. The fund, which has around $7.5 billion of assets under management, has targeted a number of acquisitions in recent months in consumer businesses in large emerging markets across Africa, the Middle East and Turkey. It is jointly bidding with TPG Capital to buy a majority holding in Saudi fast-food chain Kudu, while its investment management affiliate approached Egyptian snack maker Bisco Misr in July for a 51 percent stake. [ID:nL6N0N23BW] [ID:nL6N0PO0CT] In June, it said it intended to complete a take-over of Egyptian healthcare company Cairo Medical Center, and finalised an 80 percent stake buy of Turkish dairy products maker Yorsan in December.
