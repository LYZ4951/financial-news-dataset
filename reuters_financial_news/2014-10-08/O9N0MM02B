OSLO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Norwegian government is appointing two commissions that will examine whether to change the country's fiscal spending rule and whether to introduce multi-year budgets, Finance Minister Siv Jensen told broadcaster NRK on Wednesday.

Successive cabinets have capped their drawings from the country's sovereign wealth fund to four percent of its value, under a fiscal rule designed to avoid overheating of the economy. The high oil prices of recent years have resulted in a sharp growth in the fund's size however, leaving governments to spend less than three percent of it per year.
