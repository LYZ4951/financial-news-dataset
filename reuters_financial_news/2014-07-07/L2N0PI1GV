July 7 (Reuters) - Lion Capital has ordered American Apparel <APP.A> to immediately repay a $10 million loan, after the retailer failed to do so by a July 4 deadline, a source close to the matter said on Monday.

The ousting of American Apparel Chief Executive Officer Dov Charney more than two weeks ago prompted Lion Capital to demand repayment of a loan that was originally due in 2018. Charney allegedly misused company funds and helped spread nude photos of a former employee.
