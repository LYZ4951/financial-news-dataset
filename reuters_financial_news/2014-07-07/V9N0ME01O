VIENNA, July 7 (Reuters) - Austrian banks should keep bolstering their balance sheets because they are uncercapitalised compared with their international rivals, the central bank said on Monday.

"Banks should continue strengthening their capital levels - by retaining earnings and/or tapping capital markets - to close the gap between them and their international peers," it said in its semi-annual financial stability report.
