TEL AVIV, July 7 (Reuters) - Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug criticised a government plan to make homes more affordable for some first-time buyers by eliminating value added tax (VAT), saying it could actually lead to higher prices.

"I believe this proposal could fuel home price rises in the short term in light of the fact that what is needed in the housing market is to increase supply," Flug told parliament's finance committee. The government has promised to let some groups of young buyers forgo the 18 percent VAT, part of a package of moves meant to address public anger over spiralling living costs. Flug said the plan requires close supervision of prices, which will be difficult to carry out, and that there was a chance the weakest sectors would not benefit from the plan. "I fear this benefit will end up going mostly to the building contractors and not to the households," she said. Housing prices have soared about 80 percent since 2007, underpinned by low interest rates and limited supply allocations from the government, which owns 93 percent of Israel's land. In the 12 months ending in April, home prices increased by 8.3 percent while in recent months, a moderation in building starts has become apparent, according to the Bank of Israel. In the 12 months to March, there were 43,400 building starts and 42,400 building completions, but first quarter data were lower than in preceding quarters.
