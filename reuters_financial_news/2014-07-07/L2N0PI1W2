July 7 (Reuters) - A pair of big bond insurers with more than $10 billion of exposure to Puerto Rican debt have hired restructuring advisers as the commonwealth continues on a path toward a reckoning with creditors.

MBIA Inc. <MBI.N> is working with financial advisers from The Blackstone Group, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. Assured Guaranty Ltd. <AGO.N> has hired professionals from investment bank Houlihan Lokey, Assured's spokeswoman, Ashweeta Durani, confirmed.  The hirings are the latest sign that Puerto Rico's debt crisis appears to be moving toward a restructuring, even as some bondholders have challenged the constitutionality of a law that would allow certain of the commonwealth's public agencies to refinance their debt.  Puerto Rico is being advised by well-known New York-based restructuring lawyers, who helped write the law, and distressed debt investors have begun snapping up the commonwealth's high-yield debt. The move by MBIA and Assured to hire advisers comes as concerns grow about the exposure the bond insurers have to long-struggling Puerto Rico and its public corporations, the island's electric authority in particular. A spokesperson for MBIA did not immediately return a call. Earlier on Monday, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, struck a deal with bank lenders providing it revolving lines to allow it to delay until July 31 certain payments that are currently due. [ID:nL2N0PI1A2]  In addition to at least $671 million in bank loans, PREPA has some $8.8 billion of bonds oustanding. In all, Puerto Rico and its agencies are around $73 billion in debt. The catalyst for the latest worry among Puerto Rico creditors was enactment of a law last month setting up a path for PREPA and its sister agencies - the water and sewer and highway transportation authorities - to restructure their debts. The law "raises questions about Puerto Rico's credit conditions and willingness to pay its debt," Moody's Investors Service analyst Stanislas Rouyer wrote in a note. Given the sizeable exposure MBIA, Assured Guaranty and a third insurer, Radian Group Inc. <RDN.N>, have to the U.S. territory and its agencies, the new law is a "credit negative," Rouyer wrote. MBIA's National Public Finance Guarantee unit has $4.8 billion of total net exposure to Puerto Rico debt, according to Moody's. That is 145 percent of NPFG's statutory capital of $3.3 billion. Exposure to PREPA alone, at $1.5 billion, is equal to 46 percent of statutory capital. Assured Guaranty insures $5.4 billion of Puerto Rico bonds through three different operating units. Comparable to MBIA's NPFG, Assured's reinsurance unit has exposure that exceeds its statutory capital. Radian's exposure is smallest, at $452 million, equal to 31 percent of its statutory capital, and it has just $22 million of insurance written on PREPA bonds.
