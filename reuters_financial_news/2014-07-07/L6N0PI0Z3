DUBAI, July 7 (Reuters) - Most markets in the region look positive on Monday after Dubai and Abu Dhabi closed on Sunday near their intra-day peaks, early quarterly earnings reports lifted the Saudi index, and shareholders of Egypt's EFG Hermes indicated they valued the stock above its market price.

Dubai's bourse <.DFMGI> jumped 4.4 percent on Sunday as construction firm Arabtec, the emirate's most heavily traded stock, surged its 15 percent daily limit. The index closed at 4,594 points, just one point below the day's peak. Abu Dhabi's bourse <.ADI>, which has mostly followed the direction set by Dubai in the last few weeks, gained 1.7 percent. However, trading volumes on both markets have been declining for the last two days, suggesting rises will slow. Saudi Arabia's bourse <.TASI> may gain further after the first few corporate quarterly earnings reports published by local companies either met or beat analysts' estimates. Saudi Hollandi Bank <1040.SE> rose 2.3 percent in the last session after posting a 28.1 percent increase in second-quarter net profit. At 480.3 million riyals, its profit was 6.9 percent above analysts' average forecast. In Egypt, shareholders of investment bank EFG Hermes agreed to sell less than a half of the 20 percent stake which billionaire Naguib Sawiris and Beltone Financial Holding <BTFH.CA> had offered to buy at a price of 16.00 pounds. It is now not clear whether the purchase will go ahead; Beltone had previously said the offer would be withdrawn unless it got the full 20 percent. But Beltone can still ask the financial regulator to approve its buying a smaller stake, and the fact that so many shareholders rejected the offer can be seen as a vote of confidence in further rises of EFG shares.
