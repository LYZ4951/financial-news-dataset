July 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The rating of Goldman Sachs' latest secured funding product, Fixed Income Global Structured Covered Obligation (FIGSCO), would most likely be equalised with that of the total return swap provider, says Fitch Ratings.  In principle, this style of transaction could receive a rating uplift above the  rating of the swap provider if the structural protections led to stressed  recoveries from the portfolio that were above average unsecured recovery levels,  since the FIGSCO structure provides investors with recourse to both the swap  counterparty and a segregated pool of assets. However, in this case, the  structural protections and collateralisation levels are too low compared with  our market value rating criteria. The transaction is secured by a wide range of fixed income assets including  securitised debt, sovereign bonds, and financial and non-financial unsecured  debt with overcollateralisation (OC) levels that are marked to market daily.   Our market value criteria also analyse the level of OC based on frequent mark to  market valuations of various types of assets to arrive at the stressed, or  discounted, value of assets  available to repay rated liabilities and could be  used to assess FIGSCO's portfolio. By contrast, Fitch's covered bond rating  criteria do not offer a suitable framework for FIGSCO as the diversity of  assets, daily marking to market and potentially high debtor concentrations are  not typical features of covered bond programmes.  The collateralisation  thresholds commensurate with 'AAA' and 'AA' ratings in  our market value rating criteria are materially higher than the percentages  contained in FIGSCO's portfolio guidelines. For example, the Goldman Sachs  FIGSCO prescribes 105% collateralisation for 'AA+' to 'A-' rated bonds and 107%  for bonds in the 'BBB' category.  In comparison, in Fitch's criteria, the  equivalent standalone 'AAA' collateralisation level for a structure backed by  investment grade corporate bonds would range from 130% to 165%. For an 'AA'  rating backed by corporate bonds, the collateralisation would range from 120% to  150%. The differences are higher for high yield debt. In order for FIGSCO to  achieve a ratings uplift, OC levels would need to be materially higher, although  not necessarily at the standalone levels cited above. In addition, the selling agent has six months to sell the collateral in the  event that a trigger is breached, compared with 45-60 business days (or shorter)  typically seen in most market value structures. Triggers that result in prompt  deleveraging in times of market stress are essential protections for senior  creditors in market value structures. The longer deleveraging period could lead  to further market value erosion, reducing recoveries for bondholders. We would  also need to assess the selling agent's ability to liquidate the range of  security types and conduct on-going surveillance of marked-to-market prices.  Goldman Sachs recently roadshowed a potential issue of a secured funding product  that it has designated as FIGSCO. The issuer would be a special purpose vehicle  backed by Goldman Sachs Mitsui Marine Derivatives Products (GSMMDP), a joint  venture guaranteed by Goldman Sachs ('A') and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance [MITSID.UL] ('A+').  Fitch does not rate GSMMDP and believes 'AAA' ratings are not attainable for  derivative product companies.
