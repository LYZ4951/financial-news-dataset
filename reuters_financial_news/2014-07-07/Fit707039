July 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a newly-published report that its  outlook for Australian transportation infrastructure is stable, supported  primarily by continued traffic growth. However, exposure to medium-term bullet  debt could leave issuers vulnerable to refinancing risk in the event of a  significant downturn in the Australian economy or banking sector. Underlying traffic levels have remained generally robust in 2014 continuing the  trend of recent years.  Sydney Airport's <SYD.AX> May year-to-date traffic grew 2.5% over  the prior year, somewhat lower than growth over the same period in 2013.  Fitch  expects strong overall traffic growth in its rated Australian road portfolio to  continue through 2H 2014 following the completion of expansion works.  The performance of the road and airport assets in Fitch's Australian portfolio  are underpinned by their important economic roles: Sydney Airport is the  principal origin and destination airport in Australia; the Eastern Distributor,  Hills M2, M5 and Westlink M7 roads along with the Cross City Tunnel and the Lane  Cove Tunnel form the bulk of Sydney's orbital road network; and the Citylink  road in Melbourne is an important connection into the city's central business  district. Robust traffic performance, combined with supportive pricing  arrangements, has provided these companies with strong cash flow coverage. Nonetheless, Australian transportation issuers have unusually high exposure to  medium-term (three to five-year) domestic bullet bank debt compared with global  peers. While cash flows should be able to support potentially higher debt costs  in the future, the need for regular refinancing of these long life assets is a  weakness relative to global peers and exposes these companies to the liquidity  of the Australian banking sector.  Furthermore, the Australian economy has a high dependence on the commodities  sector and its banking sector is heavily reliant on external debt funding.  Should either of these sectors deteriorate substantially, this could leave the  Australian transportation issuers exposed to reduced traffic levels or to  difficulties refinancing maturing debt.
