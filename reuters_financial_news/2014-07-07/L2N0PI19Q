July 7 (Reuters) - Omega Pharma NV [COUCKO.UL], a Belgian healthcare products distributor, is considering selling itself nearly three years after it was taken private by its founder, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources.

A sale of the Nazareth, Belgium-based company could earn its owners more than $4 billion, the news agency quoted a person familiar with the matter as saying. (http://bloom.bg/1qccu2V) Omega Pharma could not immediately be reached for a comment. The company, which sells prescription-free medicines, healthcare products and over-the-counter (OTC) items such as wart treatments and sun tan lotions, was working with investment bank Morgan Stanley <MS.N> on the sale, and the process could start as early as this month, sources told Bloomberg.
