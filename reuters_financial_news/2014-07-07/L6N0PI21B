LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - European shares slipped on Monday after weak German economic data took the wind out of a rally that had pushed a leading regional index back near 6-1/2 year highs.

Some analysts said that while Europe's stock market rally could flatline in the near term, the longer-term outlook remained positive given steps taken by the European Central Bank to boost the region's economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which hit a 6-1/2 year high of 1,399.62 points in June, was down by 0.3 percent at 1,389.56 points by the middle of the trading day. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> fell 0.4 percent to 3,2158.30 points, while Germany's DAX <GDAXI> - which hit a record high in June - weakened by 0.2 percent. European stock markets fell after German industrial output declined by 1.8 percent on the month in May, its biggest drop in more than two years, confounding expectations of unchanged industrial output in Europe's powerhouse.

TOTAL AND SANOFI SLIP A fall in the shares of heavyweight stocks Total <TOTF.PA> and Sanofi <SASY.PA> also pegged back European markets. French oil major Total fell 0.6 percent after it said its margins would be affected by a weak performance of its refining business. French pharmaceuticals group Sanofi slipped 0.4 percent after it said adverse foreign exchange movements would affect its earnings.

"The near-term still looks positive. Mario Draghi's speech last week is still keeping a risk-on scenario," said Carlo Alberto de Casa, senior market analyst at online brokerage ActivTrades.
