HONG KONG, July 7 (Reuters) - HSBC cut its rating for Hong Kong equities to underweight from neutral on Monday, saying a campaign for greater democracy in the Asian financial centre could sour relations with China and hurt the city's economy.

Occupy Central with Love and Peace, the organisers of a recent referendum on electoral reforms, have threatened to lock down the Central area of Hong Kong, home to some of Asia's biggest companies and banks, as part of its campaign to demand greater democracy in elections for the city's leader in 2017.
