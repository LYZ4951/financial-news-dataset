LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - British housebuilder Taylor Wimpey <TW.L> said on Monday it performed strongly in the first half, with sales rates and pricing at the upper end of its expectations.

The company said it expected its operating profit margin to improve to about 16 percent, from 13.1 percent in the same period a year ago, and remained on track to deliver an increase of at least 300 basis points for the year.
