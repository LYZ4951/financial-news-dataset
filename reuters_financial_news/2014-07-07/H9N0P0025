HONG KONG, July 7 (Reuters) - China shares finished barely changed on Monday, as weakness in the energy and pharmaceutical sectors offset solid gains from property counters.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended flat at 2,059.93 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was down 0.1 percent. Property developers extended gains, with the CSI China Mainland Real Estate index <.CSICMREI> up 1.6 percent to its highest since April 14. China Vanke <000002.SZ>, which rose 3.9 percent on Friday, climbed another 3.4 percent. Poly Real Estate <600048.SS> added 2.4 percent. Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical <002422.SZ> plunged 8.1 percent after the drugmaker said it faces a probe from the securities regulator for possible disclosure violations.
