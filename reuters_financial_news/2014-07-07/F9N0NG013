HAMBURG, July 7 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should only embark on an asset-buying programme in the event of an emergency such as the immediate prospect of deflation, ECB Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said on Monday.

The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, told his monthly news conference last Thursday that the bank's Governing Council was "unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary". Lautenschlaeger said an asset-purchase programme was, in principle, part of the ECB's arsenal but that the requirements for using such a plan should be "particularly high". "Only in a real emergency, for example in the case of the immediate prospect of deflation, could, in my view, such an instrument come into consideration," Lautenschlaeger said in the text of a speech for delivery in Hamburg.
