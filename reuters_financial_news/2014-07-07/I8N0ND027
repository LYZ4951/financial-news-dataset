MUMBAI, July 7 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose to a third consecutive record high, while the benchmark BSE surpassed 26,000 points, riding on gains in technology stocks ahead of Infosys Ltd's <INFY.NS> earnings and hopes of a fiscally prudent budget later this week.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> closed 0.53 percent higher at 26,100.08 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended  0.46 percent higher at 7,787.15.
