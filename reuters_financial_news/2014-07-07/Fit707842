July 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Quadrivio SME 2012  S.r.l.'s class A notes (IT0004844673) at 'AA+sf' with Stable Outlook.  The transaction is a static cash flow securitisation of an initial EUR2.77bn  pool of commercial loans originated by Credito Valtellinese (CreVal;  BB+/Negative/B), Credito Siciliano and Cassa di Risparmio di Fano, three banks  of the Credito Valtellinese banking group.  The collateral portfolio comprises secured loans to Italian SMEs backed by  first-lien mortgages on residential and/or commercial properties (65.5% of the  total pool balance in March 2014) and second-lien (or higher) mortgages and  unsecured loans. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the class A notes' available credit enhancement (CE),  which has increased over the past nine months to March 2014 to 58.9% (vs. 50.8%  in June 2013). This was attributed to the amortisation of the underlying  portfolio, the sequential amortisation of the class A and B notes and the full  excess spread trapping mechanism envisaged by the transaction structure. As of  end-March 2014, the total pool's outstanding principal balance was equal to EUR  2,056m, representing 74.2% of its original level at closing. Fitch believes that  the high and increasing CE offsets current as well as potential further  deterioration of the transaction's performance. The performance of the transaction has been worsening and default rates have  been volatile over the past 12 months. In March 2014, the annualised quarterly  default rate peaked at 10.2% and cumulative defaults reached EUR188.1m (6.8% of  the pool balance at closing), up from EUR88.9m (3.2%) in June 2013. To reflect  the deterioration, Fitch has increased its five-year annual average probability  of default (PD) expectations to 6.2% (based on a 90 + days past due (dpd)  default definition) from 4.2% (based on a 180 + dpd default definition). New PD  expectations have been based on, among others, the new observed annual default  rates (from 2007 to 2013) for obligors with internal ratings, gathered by the  originators as part of the back-testing exercise of their new internal rating  systems, which are now based on a 90+ dpd default definition. Loans in arrears for more than 30 days have ranged between 5.4% and 6.1% of the  performing and delinquent pool balance over the last three quarters (up from  2.9% as at end-June 2013). Loans in arrears for more than 90 days were equal to  1.9% in March 2014, down from 3% in December 2013. However, this decrease is  mostly explained by the migration of late delinquencies to defaults during the  last quarter. Given the early stage of the transaction's life, cumulative recoveries are still  mostly composed of recoveries on unsecured loans and reached 7.3% of cumulative  defaults in March 2014 (down from 9.5% in June 2013). Such a reduction is mostly  due to the increase in defaults over the last year. The collateral pool features fairly low levels of obligor concentration risk  compared with other Italian SME CLO transactions, with the largest and the top  20 obligor groups accounting for, respectively, 0.6% and 8.8% of the total pool  balance at end-March 2014 (0.6% and 9.3% of the performing and delinquent  portfolio, respectively).  Industry concentration is fairly high (real estate) but still broadly in line  with other Italian SMEs CLO transactions. The largest and the top five  industries accounted for, respectively, 43.6% and 66.8% of the total pool  balance at end-March 2014.  The servicer of the portfolio is CreVal. Servicer continuity risk is adequately  mitigated by the presence of a back-up servicer (Banca Popolare di Vicenza [BPVIC.UL],  BB+/Negative/B), appointed following the downgrade of CreVal to below 'BBB-' in  August 2012. In addition, payment interruption risk is mitigated by a EUR33.9m  amortising cash reserve, held at BNP Paribas Securities Services [BNPPSS.UL] (A+/Stable/F1),  which is available to cover class A notes interest shortfalls as well as other  payments senior thereto.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The class A notes' rating is capped by the highest achievable ratings for  structured finance transactions in Italy at 'AA+sf'.  A downgrade of the Italian sovereign (BBB+/Stable/F2) could result in a revision  of the highest achievable SF ratings, depending on the specific circumstances  that have led to the rating action on the sovereign.
