July 7 (Reuters) - Banque Saudi Fransi <1050.SE>, the lender part-owned by Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA>, posted a 16 percent rise in its second-quarter net profit, it said in a bourse statement on Monday, beating analyst forecasts.

The kingdom's fourth-largest bank by assets said it made 884 million riyals ($235.7 million) in the three months ending June 30, compared with 763 million riyals in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expected the bank to post an average net profit of 839.4 million riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0PI1ED] The bank, which sold a 2 billion riyal capital-boosting sukuk last month, attributed its rise in net profit to an increase in operating income - which rose 15.2 percent to 1.48 billion riyals - without elaborating. Saudi companies issue brief earnings statements early in the reporting period before publishing more detailed results later.
