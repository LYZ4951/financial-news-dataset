EDINBURGH, July 7 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday after weak data out of Germany took the wind out of a rally that saw a top index post its best week in over three months.

German industrial output fell 1.8 percent on the month in May, its biggest drop in more than 2 years, confounding expectations of unchanged industrial output in Europe's powerhouse. [ID:nB4N0PE02X] "It's just more evidence that overall economic growth has slowed down in the second quarter from the strong first quarter," Ioan Smith, director at KCG, said. The German DAX <.GDAXI> fell 0.3 percent in early deals, a top faller in Europe along with the French CAC <.FCHI> down 0.4 percent after pharmaceutical heavyweight Sanofi <SASY.PA> warned that currency effects would impact earnings, shaving over 4 points off the index.
