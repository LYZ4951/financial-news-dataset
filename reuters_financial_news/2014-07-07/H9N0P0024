HONG KONG, July 7 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished flat on Monday, as strength in the property sector was undercut by losses for Macau casino stocks that recently rallied.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed little changed at 23,540.92 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also ended flat. Sands China <1928.HK> was the top percentage loser on the Hang Seng, off 2.0 percent in its worst day in a month. Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK>, which jumped 11 percent last week, sank 1.2 percent. China Resources Land <1109.HK> and China Overseas Land & Investment <0688.HK> advanced 1.6 and 1.7 percent, respectively, on the loosening of housing policies in some cities.   Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing <0388.HK> climbed 3.1 percent to HK$154.10, its highest since August 2011, after Jefferies initiated coverage of it with a "buy" rating and price target of HK$179.
