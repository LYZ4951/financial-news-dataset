WARSAW, July 7 (Reuters) - Poland's zloty currency <EURPLN=D2> is unlikely to be significantly affected by the European Central Bank's fresh long-term refinancing operations known as TLTRO, the head of the Polish central bank's research department said on Monday.

"If you look at the scale of new phases of LTRO, it is smaller than earlier phases, and the earlier phases did not have much impact on the zloty," Andrzej Slawinski told a news conference.
