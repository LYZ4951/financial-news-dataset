PARIS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - It is up to each euro zone government to take the right steps internally for growth while monetary policy should not aim at weakening the euro to improve competitiveness, ECB policymaker Jens Weidmann said on Tuesday, rebuffing French calls for more efforts from Germany and the currency area's central bank.
