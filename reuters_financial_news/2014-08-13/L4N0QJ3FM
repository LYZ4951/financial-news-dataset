Aug 13 (Reuters) - Thai and Indonesian stockmarkets rose to more than one-year closing highs on Wednesday, while most other Southeast Asian markets were slightly firmer amid caution among investors due to worries about global growth.

Thailand's main SET index <.SETI> ended 1.6 percent higher, its highest close since June 4 last year, while the Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> rose 0.7 percent to its highest close since May 29, 2013.  Other markets were mostly sluggish as investors mostly stayed on the sidelines, with the crisis in Ukraine threatening a fragile economic recovery in Europe.  Brighter corporate results offset gloomy economic news from Asia with weak loans data on Chinese banks adding to worries about the health of the global economy. [ID:nENNE880RX] [ID:nL6N0QJ1PK]  The Malaysian index <.KLSE> ended 0.4 percent firmer, with foreign investors buying a net $58.5 million in stocks. Jakarta saw inflows of $34.4 million on Wednesday.  "Foreign inflows were still strong in the second half, which halted the profit-taking in the morning session," said William Suryawijaya, an analyst with Indosurya Securities.  The current account deficit is still a concern, but with Indonesia's foreign reserves actually showing some increases, it indicates the macroeconomic condition is pretty stable, he said. Investors in Jakarta's stock market have been expecting the index to fall on an expected worsening of the current account deficit in the second quarter and talks about cuts in fuel subsidy. Bank Indonesia is expected to announce later this week that the country's current account deficit in April-June roughly doubled from the first quarter, but the central bank is not seen tightening policy any time soon.

[ID:nL4N0QE45L]  Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rebounded to end 0.2 percent firmer.
