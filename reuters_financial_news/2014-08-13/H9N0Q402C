HONG KONG, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark share index finished at its highest in more than 3-1/2 years on Wednesday, rebounding from midday losses rooted in weak data that sparked worry about the sustainability of China's economic recovery.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.8 percent at 24,890.34 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 1.2 percent. A third straight winning session pushed the H-index to an 8-month high.  Instant noodle maker Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding <0322.HK> led gains on the Hang Seng with a rise of 3.4 percent. Sector rival Uni-President China Holdings <0220.HK> rose 2.9 percent to a near 5-month high.
