BEIJING, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Chinese banks made 385.2 billion yuan ($62.53 billion) worth of new yuan loans in July, slowing sharply from the previous month and well below market forecasts, central bank data showed on Wednesday.

Analysts said the decline may be due to not only the cooling economy and property market, but caution on the part of the central bank about the risks of rapid credit growth, even as the government tries to stimulate the economy. [ID:nL4N0QH1O4]Some also said June's numbers may have been exaggerated by seasonal factors typically seen in financial markets at the end of a quarter and the first half of the year. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ KEY POINTS July M2 money supply +13.5 pct y/y (f'cast +14.4 pct) July new loans 385.2 bln yuan (f'cast 727.5 bln) July outstanding loan growth +13.4 pct y/y (f'cast +14 pct) July social financing aggregate 273.1 billion yuan  COMMENTARY STEPHEN GREEN, ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK: "There's a lot of seasonality in the numbers. It looks like interbank regulations are beginning to have an effect, and risk awareness is also having an effect.  "But June was a very strong for total social financing so this is a pull-back. We are expecting August to bounce back. They are not tightening monetary policy but they are focused on cleaning up the interbank market and forcing banks to hold more capital against their interbank assets."  XIAO SHIJUN, ANALYST, GUODU SECURITIES, BEIJING: "Many investors have been waiting for July's economic data to decide their investment strategy after the market's recent gains.  "Now the credit data has lagged market expectations. That is really a hit for the market sentiment. However, the market is still waiting for the rest of the data, such as retail sales and investment figures that will be announced soon (later on Wednesday).  "Institutions will take all these data into considerations, so we cannot immediately say whether the market's recent rally is over or not."   LOUIS KUIJS, ECONOMIST, RBS, HONG KONG: "Wow. That's remarkably low. It's surprising. On the face of it, we've not observed any tightening of monetary conditions by policymakers. Interbank lending rates have not gone up. Compared to 819 billion yuan a year ago for total social financing, this is very, very low by any measure.  "I don't know if this has anything to do with disagreements between policymakers. In its recent monetary policy report, the central bank warned of continued risks in fast credit lending."  MARKET REACTION - China's main stock index, the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, reversed earlier gains and fell after the credit data was released.
