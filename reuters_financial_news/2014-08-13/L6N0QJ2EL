REYKJAVIK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Iceland's finance minister said on Wednesday the government is exploring the possibility of appointing more than one central bank governor to handle the job's increased workload as the country tries to find its feet after the financial crisis.

The government is due to name a central bank governor by Aug. 20. Mar Gudmundsson, who is completing a five-year term as central bank governor, has re-applied for the job. "I am leaning more and more towards there being good reason to have more than one governor at the central bank," Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson was quoted as saying in an interview with media group Visir. "Among other things, this is because the tasks of the central bank governor have greatly increased in the last few years. Today we, for instance, have a currency reserve that is many times the size of what it used to be," he added. Exactly how the job would be split and who would resolve any disagreement between two governors were still being worked out. No one at the finance ministry was available who could provide more information. A spokeswoman at the ministry did confirm the comments to Reuters and said the government would have to ask parliament to amend the current law in order to have more than one governor. The central bank governor will play a key role in removing capital controls put in place after the country's top banks collapsed under a mountain of debt in 2008. The new head will also be involved in deciding how to handle the estates of the old banks.
