CAIRO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> remained stable at a central bank dollar sale on Wednesday but weakened, fractionally, on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $38.8 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Monday. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Wednesday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.40 pounds, one trader said, slightly weaker than Monday's rate of 7.39.
