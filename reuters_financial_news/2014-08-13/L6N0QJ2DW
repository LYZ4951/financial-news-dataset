KAMPALA, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The yield on Uganda's two-year Treasury bond edged up as the yield on the 10-year bond slipped down in a sale worth a combined total of 160 billion shillings ($61.37 million), the central bank said on Wednesday.

The ten-year bond returned a yield of 13.953 percent, barely changed from the 13.964 percent realised at the previous sale.
