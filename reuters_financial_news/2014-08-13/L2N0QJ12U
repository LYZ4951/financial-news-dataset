SANTIAGO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Chilean bank Corpbanca <COB.SN> expects its merger with Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco <ITUB4.SA> to be completed by the first quarter of 2015, it said on Wednesday.

The deal, which would be Latin America's largest banking combination since 2008, has faced stiff opposition from minority shareholder Cartica and is being probed by the World Bank's private investment arm International Finance Corp.
