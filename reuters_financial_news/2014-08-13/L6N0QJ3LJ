LAGOS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira currency gained 0.19 percent on the interbank market on Wednesday, driven by dollar sales by major energy companies, including state-owned NNPC.

The currency closed at 161.80 to the dollar, from 162.12  the previous day. Chevron's <CVX.N> unit sold $60.7 million, Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) sold an unspecified amount and NNPC asked lenders to bid for its usual dollar sale, prompting gains in the naira's value. Nigeria's currency touched a five-week low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, on renewed dollar demand, but the currency recovered some lost ground this week after a unit of Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L> came twice into the market. "We probably stay on sub-162 to the dollar for some time till any major demand for the dollar hits the market," one dealer said.
