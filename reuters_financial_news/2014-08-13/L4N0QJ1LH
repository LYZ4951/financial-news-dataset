KEY POINTS July M2 money supply +13.5 pct y/y (f'cast +14.4 pct) July new loans 385.2 bln yuan (f'cast 727.5 bln) July outstanding loan growth +13.4 pct y/y (f'cast +14 pct) July social financing aggregate 273.1 billion yuan  COMMENTARY LOUIS KUIJS, ECONOMIST, RBS, HONG KONG: "Wow. That's remarkably low. It's surprising. On the face of it, we've not observed any tightening of monetary conditions by policymakers. Interbank lending rates have not gone up. Compared to 819 billion yuan a year ago for total social financing, this is very, very low by any measure.  "I don't know if this has anything to do with disagreements between policymakers. In its recent monetary policy report, the central bank warned of continued risks in fast credit lending."  MARKET REACTION - China's main stock index, the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, reversed earlier gains and fell after the credit data was released.
