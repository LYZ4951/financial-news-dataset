PARIS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - European shares gained ground in early trade on Wednesday, helped by forecast-beating results from bellwethers such as Swiss Life <SLHN.VX>, although gains could be capped by weak macro figures from Asia and worries over the Ukrainian crisis.

At 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,323.88 points. Swiss Life <SLHN.VX> rose 3.5 percent after Switzerland's largest dedicated life insurer beat expectations with a slight rise in first-half net income, buoyed by a strong performance in its home market.
