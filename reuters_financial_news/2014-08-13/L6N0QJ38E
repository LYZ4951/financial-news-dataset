JERUSALEM, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The Psagot brokerage on Wednesday raised its recommendation for shares of Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank <MZTF.TA> to "outperform" from "hold" after Israel's fourth-largest bank reported better than expected second-quarter results.

Psagot maintained a target price of 50 shekels for the bank, which were up 2.4 percent at 45 shekels in afternoon trading in Tel Aviv.
