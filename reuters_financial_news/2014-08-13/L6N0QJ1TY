LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - European stock markets were steady on Wednesday, supported by gains in utility E.ON <EONGn.DE> and reinsurer Swiss Life <SLHN.VX> shares after forecast-beating results.

However, nagging worries about tensions over Ukraine, where Kiev forces have been fighting pro-Russian separatists, limited the market's rebound from a recent sharp slide. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which had hit a 6-1/2 year high in late June but then fell back by some 5 percent due to the uncertainty over Ukraine, edged up by 0.3 percent to 1,324.15 points in midsession trading. A 4.1-percent rise at E.ON gave one of the biggest lifts to the FTSEurofirst 300. Even though E.ON posted a drop in interim profits, with a warning over the impact of the Ukraine crisis on its Russian business, its shares rose as the results beat analysts' forecasts.

[ID:nL6N0QJ0E9] Even though the situation between Russia and Ukraine remained tense, traders for now were still betting on the situation not escalating too seriously. [ID:nL6N0QI07K] [ID:nL6N0QJ25I]"I think the market went down too far, too fast. I'm a buyer at these levels," Zurich-based ACIES Asset Management hedge fund trader and principal, Andreas Clenow, said. "I think neither side has an interest in a prolonged fight," he said. Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss bank Reyl, also did not expect a major conflict to develop between Western powers and Russia over Ukraine. "We are watching the situation very carefully. You never know, suddenly the situation may change, but I do not think Putin will go for a full military intervention."
