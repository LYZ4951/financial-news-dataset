BERLIN, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Germany has urged its nationals to leave Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone due to concern over the Ebola virus, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.

"The government's crisis management group met this morning to discuss West Africa and the Ebola virus. It decided to request all German citizens in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia  to leave," he said. The request did not apply to medical workers or German diplomatic staff and embassies will remain open, he added.
