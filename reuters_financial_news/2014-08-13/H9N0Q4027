HONG KONG, Aug 13 (Reuters) - China shares surrendered most early gains and ended flat on Wednesday after disappointing economic data sparked worry a recovery may be at risk despite government efforts to shore up growth.

The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings ended the day up 0.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was also up 0.1 percent, at 2,222.88 points. The benchmark index rose 0.4 percent to an 8-month high in early trade, but then fell to be down as much as 0.9 percent after central bank data showed the amount of money flowing into China's economy slowed to the lowest level in nearly six years in July.
