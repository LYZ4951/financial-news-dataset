Aug 13 (Reuters) - The Thai index rose to a two-week high on Wednesday while most other Southeast Asian markets were slightly firmer as cautious investors awaited cues on the global economy.

Thailand's main stock index <.SETI> jumped 1.3 percent to its highest intra-day level since July 19.  Stockbrokers and strategists attributed the strong gain to hopes of better earnings and as the market had resumed after two days of holidays since closing on Friday. Other markets were mostly sluggish as cautious investors stayed on the sidelines on worries over global growth and as the crisis in Ukraine threatened a fragile economic recovery in Europe.  Weak loan data on Chinese banks also added to worries over the global economy as markets braced for more Chinese economic reports later in the day, including industrial production and retail sales for July. [ID:nENNE880RX]  The Malaysian index <.KLSE> was up 0.2 percent at 0637 GMT, while Philippines <.PSI> traded 0.1 percent firmer after recovering from early losses.  The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> edged up 0.2 percent with the market expecting the index to fall on an expected worsening of the current account deficit in the second quarter and talks over cutting the fuel subsidy. On Friday, Bank Indonesia is expected to announce that the country's current account deficit in April-June roughly doubled from the first quarter, but the central bank is not seen tightening policy any time soon.
