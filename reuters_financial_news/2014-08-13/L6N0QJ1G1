DUBAI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Kuwait Finance House <KFIN.KW> (KFH) is awaiting regulatory approval to hire the former head of consumer banking at National Bank of Kuwait <NBKK.KW> as its new chief executive, the country's biggest Islamic lender said on Wednesday.

KFH made the disclosure in a bourse statement in response to a story published in Kuwaiti newspaper Al Qabas on July 25 that named Mazen al-Nahedh as the bank's new chief executive.  Earlier this month, National Bank of Kuwait said al-Nahedh had submitted his resignation and would leave the bank on Oct. 21. [ID:nL6N0QA2KG]
