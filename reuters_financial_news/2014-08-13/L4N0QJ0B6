SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Australian shares slipped 0.2 percent on Wednesday after Wall Street edged down and investors again became wary about developments in Ukraine, though an uptick in earnings helped buoy the market.

Investors kept an eye on Russia, which sent a convoy of 280 trucks carrying humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraine. Western officials had been wary of the gesture, fearing Russia would use the mission as a cover for invading Ukraine.

A measure of Australian consumer sentiment rose strongly in August as households grew more optimistic on the near-term economic outlook and fretted less about their finances, even as wage growth stayed stuck at 16-year lows.
