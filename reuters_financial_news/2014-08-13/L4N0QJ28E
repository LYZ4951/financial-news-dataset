BANGKOK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Thai telecoms group, Intouch Holdings Pcl <INTUCH.BK>, said on Wednesday its second-quarter net profit dropped 5 percent from a year earlier due to lower contributions from its mobile affiliate, Advanced Info Service (AIS) <ADVANC.BK>.

Intouch, 41.62 percent owned by Aspen Holdings, a wholly owned unit of Singapore's Temesek Holdings [TEM.UL], posted an April-June net profit of 3.5 billion baht ($109.58 million) versus 3.68 billion a year earlier, it said in a statement. The company expects revenue from sales and services to rise 5-7 percent in 2014.  Intouch, formerly known as Shin Corp, owns 40.5 percent of AIS and 41.1 percent of satellite operator Thaicom Pcl <THCOM.BK>.
