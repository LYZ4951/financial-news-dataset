ZURICH, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Switzerland's largest dedicated life insurer beat expectations with a slight rise in first-half net income, buoyed by a strong performance in its home market, and said it is buying a real estate service provider in Germany.

The Zurich-based insurer reported a net profit of 487 million Swiss francs (536.46 million US dollar), compared to a forecast for a fall to 454 million, according to the average of eight estimates in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages. [ID:nL6N0QI1VG] Swiss Life said it is expanding its real estate asset management operations with the acquisition of German-based Corpus Sireo for 210 million euros (280.62 million US dollar).
