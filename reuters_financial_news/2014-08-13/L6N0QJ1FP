LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro on Wednesday after data showed British workers earned less in the second quarter than they did in the same period last year, despite an improvement in jobs numbers.

Sterling hit a day's low of $1.6794 after the data from $1.6821 beforehand <GBP=D4>. The euro trimmed some of its earlier losses to trade at 79.54 pence, up from 79.35 pence before the data <EURGBP=D4>.  The numbers underscore the challenge facing the Bank of England which is due to explain later on Wednesday what the mixed signals from the labour market mean for its thinking on when to raise interest rates.
