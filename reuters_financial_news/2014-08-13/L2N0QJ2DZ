NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Argentine holdout creditor Aurelius Capital Management said on Wednesday that after talks with many financial institutions, the prospects for finding a private-settlement solution to the sovereign debt dispute had garnered no realistic proposals.

"That engagement has convinced us that there is no realistic prospect of a private solution," Aurelius said in a statement. "No proposal we received was remotely acceptable. The entities making such proposals were not prepared to fund more than a small part, if any, of the payments they wanted us to accept. One proposal was withdrawn before we could even respond. And no proposal made by us received a productive response," the statement said. Aurelius is run by Mark Brodsky, who, along with his former firm Elliott Management Corp, have waged a decade-long battle in the U.S. courts to collect on defaulted Argentine debt from 2002.
