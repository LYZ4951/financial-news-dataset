BRUSSELS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved the restructuring plan of Slovenian lender Abanka Vipa, adding that it will return the bank to long-term viability without continued state support.

The euro zone country narrowly avoided an international bailout in December last year by pumping 3.3 billion euros ($4.41 billion) into its mostly state-owned banks and has since continued to clean up its financial sector. The restructuring of Slovenia's third-largest bank covers a first state recapitalisation of 348 million euros, temporarily authorised by the Commission in December, and a second payment of 243 million euros. The Commission had already approved restructuring plans for Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB) and Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM), as well as aid for the orderly winding down of Factor Banka and Probanka.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For more details, see: http://bit.ly/ViC38F   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> CONFIDENCE BOOST "Abanka's restructuring plan is designed to ensure that the bank becomes viable again. After our decisions on NLB and NKBM, today's decision will further strengthen the confidence in the Slovenian banking system," European Competition Commissioner  Joaquín Almunia said on Wednesday. In addition to the two recapitalisation payments, Abanka will transfer 1.087 billion euros of assets to BAMC, the bad bank set up to take on Slovenian banks' non-performing loans. To strengthen burden-sharing requirements, private creditors such as shareholders and junior bond holders will contribute to the costs of the restructuring, while senior debt holders and insured deposits remain shielded.
