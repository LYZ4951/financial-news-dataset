DUBAI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Bahrain's Gulf Finance House reported a 252 percent increase in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday.

The firm, which suffered heavily in the wake of the global financial crisis and required multiple debt restructurings, made a net profit of $9.5 million in the three months to June 30, according to an emailed statement.  This compares with a profit of $2.7 million in the year-earlier period.
