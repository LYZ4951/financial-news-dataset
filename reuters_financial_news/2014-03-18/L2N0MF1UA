TORONTO, March 18 (Reuters) - Canada's Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced on Tuesday that he is resigning from politics, effective immediately, and will be returning to the private sector.

AVERY SHENFELD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS  "It's an opportunity for him to make a graceful exit, he's apparently got some opportunities in private sector. I don't see this as indicating any significant change in Canadian fiscal policy." "The only issue is that there was obviously some division within cabinet over whether income splitting would be the best tax cut to offer pre-election, and he was on the side of looking at other options. So we'll see if that tilts the balance one way or the other."
