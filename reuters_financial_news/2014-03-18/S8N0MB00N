LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday the central bank will not rush into using its tools to deal with risks related to a strengthening housing market.

"We shouldn't be trigger happy. We have the tools, we're well armed to address those risks," said Carney. "We're not going to use (those tools) just to prove that we can - we're going to use them in a proportionate, graduated way."
