LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that he welcomed the decision by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to double the currency's trading band as part of its commitment to let markets play a greater role in the economy.

"We welcome the move by the PBOC. We welcome all measures that have been taken, will be taken, to further the internationalisation of the renminbi," Carney told a news conference after a speech outlining a major reorganisation at the BoE.
