BRUSSELS, March 18 (Reuters) - International lenders and Greece are likely to reach a deal later on Tuesday that will pave the way for the release of the next tranche of emergency loans to Athens, the European Commission said.

Talks between the Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the Greek government on reforms that Greece must implement to get the next tranche of money have dragged on since September.
