March 18 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <IPO-ALIB.N> is leaning toward listing its shares on IntercontinentalExchange Group's <ICE.N> New York Stock Exchange instead of Nasdaq OMX Group's exchange <NDAQ.O>, according to the Wall Street Journal.

No deal has been signed, but Alibaba has indicated to people involved in the precess that it prefers NYSE, the Journal said, citing an unspecified number of unnamed sources.
