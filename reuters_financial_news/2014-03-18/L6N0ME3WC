COPENHAGEN, March 18(Reuters) - Danish banks and mortgage institutions will have to hold more capital and liquidity reserves from 2015 after the country's parliament on Tuesday adopted a bill implementing the EU's new rules on financial buffers.

The bill will mean Denmark's six biggest credit institutions will be designated Systemic Important Financial Institutions (SIFI) and will have to increase their capital buffers by between 1.0 and 3.0 percentage points of their risk weighed assets. Lenders will also face counter-cyclical requirements where,  if a bank runs a bigger risk than an average bank during a business-cycle upturn, it will be asked by the supervisory authority to hold more capital to meet losses in times of recession. The new legislation will force Denmark's biggest financial institution, Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>, to hold a capital buffer of at least 15.0 percent of its risk weighed assets from 2019, when the rules come fully into force, according to a paper from the government.  Each financial institution will also have to employ a group of people who can deal in confidence with information from a whistleblower about possible unlawful or improper behaviour inside the organisation.
