HONG KONG, March 18 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares ended firmer on Tuesday, led by index heavyweight Tencent <0700.HK>, but investors remained cautious on concern over how fast China's economy will grow this year.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.5 percent at 21,583.5 on the day, its first gain after four days of losses. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong edged up 0.1 percent. Internet giant Tencent rose 5.8 percent in its biggest daily gain since January 29.
