March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed asset-backed commercial paper (CP) issued by Thames Asset Global Securitisation No.1 Inc.'s [THAGS.UL] (TAGS), Churchill Loan Asset Securitisation Programme LLC (Churchill) and Orchid Funding Corporation (Orchid) at 'F1sf', following a review of three programmes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating affirmations are driven by the liquidity support provided by Royal  Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> (RBS, A/Stable/F1) to the transactions funded in TAGS,  Churchill and Orchid. The rating action follows a discussion with the management of RBS and takes into  consideration the conduits' performance, commercial paper (CP) issuance,  portfolio composition, IT administration systems, administrative procedures and  credit policies over the previous 12 months. TAGS held 13 assets as of end-February 2014, seven of which are classified as  fully supported transactions. The remaining six assets are partially supported,  exposing the CP to the underlying assets' risk. As all transactions in TAGS are  currently funded by the fully drawn liquidity facilities, this prevents further  issuance of the CP to fund these assets. Fitch considered this feature as  supportive of the 'F1sf' rating on TAGS's CP. In Churchill all transactions benefit from the full liquidity support provided  by RBS, thus eliminating the exposure to the underlying asset performance risk.  At the same time, the remaining six transactions in Orchid are fully wrapped by  the drawn liquidity facilities from RBS.RATING SENSITIVITIES If RBS's Short-term IDR is downgraded, the rating of the CP of TAGS, Churchill  and Orchid would also be downgraded.   Transaction Characteristics TAGS is a partially supported, multi-seller ABCP programme structured to issue  euro, GBP and USD CP to fund the purchase of diverse asset types up to a maximum  programme limit of USD40bn.  During 2013, 19 transactions have been terminated or removed from TAGS and 13  transactions remained, with one being newly added to the conduit. As of  end-February 2014, TAGS had a total CP outstanding of USD250,000.
