DUBLIN, March 18 (Reuters) - Ireland's central bank on Tuesday fined a subsidiary of Italian lender UniCredit <CRDI.MI> 315,000 euros ($439,000) for breaching risk controls by holding more Italian and Spanish bonds than permitted and for excessive exposure to a single client.

The central bank said in a statement it had agreed a settlement with UniCredit Bank Ireland Plc after it was found to have held more non-euro denominated sovereign Italian and Spanish bonds than permitted under EU rules, on dates in 2011 and 2012. In late 2012 UniCredit Bank Ireland had exposure to a single client in excess of permitted limits under EU rules, the statement said.  Unicredit immediately informed the central bank of the breaches and had introduced enhanced procedures to avoid a repeat, the statement said.
