BUCHAREST, March 18 (Reuters) - Volksbank Romania will offload non-performing loans with a total nominal value of 490 million euros ($682.42 million), the bank's President Benoit Catel said in an email to Reuters, selling at an undisclosed discount.

"This transaction further de-risks the business, and results in a cumulative 93 percent reduction of our real estate non-performing loan portfolio," Catel said. "We continue in parallel to focus on growing the profitable core of our business. Currently, we are in advanced negotiations with a group of investors. Their name will be communicated after signing, although closing may take few months."
