March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the rating of SCF Rahoituspalvelut Limited as follows: EUR39.5m Class A notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable The transaction is a securitisation of auto loan receivables originated to  Finnish individuals and companies by Santander Consumer Finance Oy, a 100%  subsidiary of the Norway-based Santander Consumer Bank AS [SANCNB.UL], which is a 100%  subsidiary of Santander Consumer Finance, S.A. [SANCN.UL] (BBB+/Stable/F2).  Key Rating Drivers The rating action reflects the transaction's solid performance as well as  significant credit enhancement due to amortisation. Cumulative defaults and losses amounted to 0.59% and 0.23% as of end-January  2014 and are below Fitch's expectations. While  early stage (30 to 60 days)  delinquencies have been increasing since closing in April 2012, later stage  delinquencies have remained stable and low with 90+ arrears at 0.25% as of  end-January 2014. The transaction's reserve fund started amortising in line with its target level  after the asset balance reached 50% of its initial amount in June 2013. It  currently stands at EUR3.6m and, if unused, will amortise to a floor of EUR  2.4m. Excess spread has remained at healthy levels to date and comfortably  covered all losses so far without any requirement to draw upon the reserve fund.  Fitch's lifetime default and loss expectations have been revised to 1.5% and  0.45% respectively in light of the solid performance.
