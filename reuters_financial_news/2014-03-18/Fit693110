March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Credit Management and Investor Solutions B.V.'s (CMIS, specifically Adaxio, the servicing entity) Dutch Residential Mortgage Special and Master Servicer Ratings to 'RSS2' and 'RMS2' from 'RSS2-' and 'RMS2-' respectively. At the same time, Fitch has assigned it a Dutch Residential Mortgage Primary Servicer Rating of 'RPS2-'.   Over the last 18 months, CMIS has acquired Welke Beheer B.V, providing it, among  other things, with improved call centre capabilities and enabling it to offer  origination services. CMIS has also acquired De HypotheekShop, giving it access  to additional distribution channels.  CMIS now covers the full end-to end  mortgage value chain. In October 2012, the majority of primary servicing activities, for some  portfolios were brought in-house to CMIS from the previous servicer. The  assignment of the primary servicer rating is reflective of CMIS now offering a  full suite of primary servicing capabilities. However, as the company has been  completing some of these tasks for less than 18 months, its primary servicing  experience lags behind some Dutch peers. The upgrades reflect enhancements to CMIS's mature risk management framework  over the last 12 months, with the additions to the risk assurance platform  providing improved regular risk and control reporting. The framework consists of  a combined compliance, risk management and internal audit function. It is  further supported by external audits, such as the extended scope of an ISAE Type  II report. However, the framework is yet to be fully rolled out to the newly  acquired entities. CMIS's servicing technology platform remains strong, with a data warehouse  providing state-of-the-art technology and sound reporting. Enhancements have  been made that are deemed to be particularly beneficial to the master servicing  function. Furthermore, recent developments include multi-channel customer  contact technology comprising a dialler to support campaign management. CMIS continues to address a difficult market environment in the Netherlands with  innovative servicing strategies, such as portfolio segmentation and a real  estate management team that Fitch considers as market-leading among its rated  peers. This is demonstrated by stable arrears performance and a high percentage  of private sales compared with peers. Furthermore, CMIS is one of few to have  developed an arrears prevention methodology, which is still fairly new to the  Dutch RMBS market.  CMIS continues to provide high-quality training, as demonstrated by staff  rotations across functions, an increased emphasis on soft skills and client  focus.  This is supported by the hiring of an additional internal trainer. Fitch  considers this particularly important for CMIS's extended call centre activities  and the integration of staff from acquired entities and servicing rights.  Fitch used its global servicer rating criteria to analyse the servicer's  operations and financial condition, including a comparison against similar Dutch  servicers as part of the review process. The analysis is based on information  provided to Fitch by CMIS and other Dutch servicers.
