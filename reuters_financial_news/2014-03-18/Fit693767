March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed Ukraine-based Ukrsotsbanks's (Ukrsots) 'B-' Long-term local currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and 'AAA(ukr)' National Long-term Rating on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating action reflects the potential sale of Ukrsots, as recently announced  by its ultimate parent UniCredit S.p.A. <CRDI.MI> (UniCredit, BBB+/Negative). Unicredit  currently owns 98.64% of Ukrsots through its Vienna subsidiary UniCredit Bank  Austria AG [UCUBA.UL] (A/Stable).  UniCredit has put Ukrsots in the category 'held for sale' in its group reporting  for 2013 and simultaneously created an impairment provision following the  reclassification of this investment. UniCredit had indicated that a sale within  the next 12 months was possible prior to the recent escalation of the political  crisis in Ukraine. The RWN reflects Fitch's view that shareholder support will  probably become less reliable if the bank is sold, in particular if the sale is  to local shareholders.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Fitch expects to resolve the RWN once the sale, should it take place, is  completed. If, in Fitch's view, support from new shareholders cannot be factored  into the ratings, then the Long-term local currency IDR is likely to be  downgraded to the level of the bank's Viability Rating (currently 'ccc'). Fitch believes that UniCredit will likely have a high propensity to provide  support to Ukrsots prior to any sale. However, the ability of the bank to  utilise this support to service its obligations could be constrained by the  introduction of transfer and convertibility or other capital restrictions in  Ukraine if the crisis in the country intensifies.  The rating actions are as follows:  Long-term foreign currency IDR: affirmed at 'CCC'  Long-term local currency IDR: 'B-'; placed on Rating Watch Negative  Senior unsecured local currency debt: 'B-'/Recovery Rating 'RR4'/'AAA(ukr)'  placed on Rating Watch Negative  Upcoming senior unsecured local currency debt: 'B-(EXP)'/Recovery Rating  'RR4'/'AAA(EXP)(ukr)', placed on Rating Watch Negative Short-term foreign currency IDR: affirmed at 'C' Support Rating: affirmed at '5' Viability Rating: unaffected at 'ccc'
