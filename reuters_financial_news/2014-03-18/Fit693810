March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed Vodafone Group Plc's <VOD.L> 'A-'  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN), following  the announcement of its intentions to acquire 100% of the share capital of Grupo  Corporativo Ono, S.A. (Ono) in an offer representing an enterprise value of  EUR7.2bn for Ono. A full list of rating actions is below. We will likely downgrade Vodafone's rating by one notch if it acquires Ono  without taking other measures to reduce debt. Vodafone's leverage is currently  low for a 'A-' rating with funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage  expected to be 1.2x at the end of March 2014. However, the planned acquisition  of Ono, and expenditure on Project Spring over the next few years, could push  this metric to above 2.5x within 18 months, which is the upper end of the  leverage range for a 'A-' rating. The acquisition of Ono should significantly  improve Vodafone's competitive position in Spain, which accounted for 6% of  Vodafone's consolidated EBITDA in 1HFY14.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Crystallisation of Acquisition Risk The announced acquisition of Ono crystallises part of the acquisition risk for  Vodafone's credit profile, which was part of the rationale for Fitch revising  the Outlook on Vodafone's IDR to Negative on 4 March. Vodafone says it takes  decisions on European fixed-line infrastructure on a country-by-country basis  and that it could obtain this infrastructure by buying an existing operator,  building its own or agreeing a wholesale deal with an incumbent. The Ono  acquisition comes when Vodafone's headroom at the 'A-' level is likely to be  significantly reduced over the next few years as a result of Project Spring. In  addition to potential European fixed line acquisitions, there is also possible  consolidation in the Indian market as well as other additional emerging market  opportunities.  Project Spring Payoff Vodafone's plan to spend an additional GBP7bn in capex over the next two years  could allow it to build a network quality advantage over its competitors, which  could increase market share and over time, improve cash flow generation.  Visibility of a return on this investment remains limited. However, Vodafone  will need to be able to demonstrate to subscribers that a quality differential  exists and the subscriber might have to be willing to pay a price premium for  this network advantage, depending on Vodafone's competitors' reactions.   Increasing Emerging Market Exposure  Post-Verizon Wireless disposal, Europe's contribution to overall group cash flow  is continuing to decline, while the importance of Vodafone's emerging market  business continues to grow. This exposes the group to higher degrees of emerging  market risk compared with historical levels. The two Indian tax cases and the  uncertainty surrounding the 2013 Indian spectrum auctions highlight the  unpredictability of these markets. The increasing exposure also exposes Vodafone  to the threat of increased FX variability, although Fitch acknowledges the  presence of offsetting local currency debt to help mitigate this risk.  Deteriorating Trends Vodafone has experienced deterioration in organic service revenue growth in  almost all of the company's main markets. While macro conditions and regulatory  headwinds should begin to improve, there is still likely to be a continued drag  on EBITDA over the coming few years and there is limited visibility over an  inflection point in this trend.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: - Expectation of FFO adjusted net leverage being sustained above 2.5x would lead  to a downgrade.  - Sustained pressure on free cash flow (FCF) driven by weak EBITDA growth,  higher capex and shareholder remuneration, or significant underperformance in  key markets. Positive (removal of RWN and affirmation at 'A-' with a Stable Outlook): - FFO adjusted net leverage below 2.5x on a sustained basis together with  healthy FCF generation. - High single-digit pre-dividend FCF to sales is expected for a 'A-' rating. - Evidence of successful monetisation of the Project Spring investments, leading  to an improved competitive position for Vodafone in its European operations  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS: Long-term IDR: 'A-' placed on RWN Senior unsecured: 'A-' placed on RWN Short-term IDR: affirmed at 'F2' Commercial Paper Programme: affirmed at 'F2'
