ATHENS, March 18 (Reuters) - Greece sold 1.3 billion euros ($1.81 billion) of three-month treasury bills on Tuesday to roll over a maturing issue, the country's debt agency PDMA said.

The T-bills were priced to yield 3.10 percent, down from 3.60 percent in a February auction. The sale's bid-cover ratio was 2.38, unchanged from the previous sale. The amount raised included 300 million euros in non-competitive bids. The settlement date for Tuesday's auction will be March 21. Greece lost access to bond markets three years ago, when its debt crisis erupted and monthly T-bill sales are its sole remaining source of market funding.
