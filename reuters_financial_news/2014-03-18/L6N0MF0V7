COPENHAGEN, March 18 (Reuters) - NNIT, the information technology unit of Danish pharmaceuticals company Novo Nordisk <NOVOb.CO>, said on Tuesday it had appointed Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> to advise on the possibility of a separate listing.

Novo Nordisk announced in January it was looking into the possibility of spinning off NNIT, saying it wanted to concentrate on its core activity. [ID:nL5N0KP1GF] NNIT published an operating profit (EBIT) of 246.5 million Danish crowns ($46.00 million) on Tuesday, up 13.7 percent from 2012. It said it expected EBIT to grow by 10 percent in 2014. That put it in a strong position, said its Chief Financial Officer, Krogsgaard Thomsen. "So this means the evaluation of a potential listing on the stock exchange continues as planned," he added.
