March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed Cableuropa S.A.'s [ONOCA.UL] (Cableuropa) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B' on Rating Watch Positive (RWP)  following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Grupo Corporativo Ono,  S.A. (Cableuropa's ultimate holding company) by Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone;  A-/RWN). A list of debt securities/instruments affected by the RWP is provided  at the end of this commentary.  The rating watch recognises the potential for Cableuropa to be owned and become  part of a materially stronger and higher-rated parent, with the company likely  to benefit from increased financial flexibility, alongside revenue and operating  cost synergies.  Key to any eventual upgrade of Cableuropa will be a review of management's  medium-term intentions with respect to Cableuropa's current outstanding debt and  future funding. The transaction is subject to antitrust approval and is expected  by Fitch to close in 2014. Fitch expects to resolve the rating watch shortly  after the transaction's close.  For Fitch's views on the implications for Vodafone see separate commentary on  "Fitch Puts Vodafone on Rating Watch Negative" dated 18 March 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com  KEY RATING DRIVERS Parent-subsidiary Linkage The linkage between Cableuropa and its new parent will be considered according  to Fitch's parent-subsidiary methodology. Strong linkage can, in certain  circumstances, lead to an equalisation of the companies' respective ratings. A  final outcome will depend on an assessment of legal, operational and strategic  ties between the two companies.  In the absence of a parent company guarantee of Cableuropa's existing debt, some  notching down from the stronger rated parent can, however, be expected (Fitch  notes that in the case of Vodafone's acquisition of German cable operator, KDG,  the latter was rated at BBB+ following transaction close in December 2013, one  notch below the parent). Quad-Play and Operational Benefits Cableuropa is Spain's largest cable operator. The company has approximately 1.9  million retail customers (residential and small business) and has a fibre  network built-out past 7.2 million homes (approx. 40% of Spain's primary homes).  The company has established a solid presence in the country's telecoms market  with telephony and high-speed broadband its most strongly penetrated services. A  rapidly growing mobile business - currently offered through a virtual mobile  network operator agreement with Telefonica - has seen the company increase  mobile customers to 1.1 million by FY13. Spain is one of the most advanced  quad-play markets in Europe, with the potential for Cableuropa to integrate and  cross-sell its fixed- line services with Vodafone, the country's second-largest  mobile operator (by subscribers and revenues), offering the potential for  material revenue and cost synergies.   Future Funding Strategy The post-acquisition funding strategy at Cableuropa will be key to identifying  the potential notching between the company and its parent when resolving the  rating watch. Cableuropa has approximately EUR3.5n of debt outstanding composed  of a mix of secured bank debt, secured notes and unsecured notes - all of which  benefit from change of control language in documentation. Second call dates for  most of the bonds fall between 4Q14 and 1Q15, in Fitch's view providing the most  obvious opportunity for management to consider any potential near-term  refinancing plans given the sizeable cost savings that could be achieved from a  more centralised funding strategy.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: -Completion of the announced acquisition by Vodafone, which is likely to lead to  an upgrade of Cableuropa and its related debt. In the event the transaction does  not proceed the RWP will be removed and the ratings would be expected to be  affirmed at current levels, reflecting the company's standalone credit profile.  On a stand-alone basis Cableuropa exhibits a solid operating profile in the  context of a difficult operating environment; where the economy, intensifying  competition and austerity-driven fiscal policies have had an impact on the  company's revenues, operating margins and cash flow.  - Funds from operations (FFO) net leverage below 5.0x (correlating to around  4.5x net debt EBITDA) and the generation of a high-single digit free cash flow  margin could lead to an upgrade. Fitch will also monitor Cableuropa's ability to  manage any increase in competitive dynamics over the coming years.   Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - An increase in FFO-adjusted net leverage above 5.5x, together with a  substantial weakening of the company's cash flow generation ability  The following instruments have been placed on RWPCableuropa senior secured bank: 'BB-'/'RR2' Nara Cable Funding [NCBFN.UL] senior secured bonds: 'BB-'/'RR2' Nara Cable Funding II senior secured bonds: 'BB-'/'RR2' ONO Finance II plc [ONOFNB.UL] unsecured notes: 'CCC+'/'RR6'
