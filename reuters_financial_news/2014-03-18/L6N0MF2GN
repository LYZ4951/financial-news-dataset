JERUSALEM, March 18 (Reuters) - Israeli developer of stem cell therapies Gamida Cell has received a buyout offer worth hundreds of millions dollars from an unnamed global pharmaceutical company, two shareholders in the company said on Tuesday.

Elbit Medical Technologies <EMTC.TA>, which has a 30.8 percent share in Gamida, said the offer includes a "significant immediate payment and additional future payments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars". Israel's Globes financial daily reported that the interested buyer was Swiss drugmaker Novartis <NOVN.VX>, though a spokeswoman for Elbit said they were not commenting on the report. The offer was received on March 7, said Clal Biotechnology Industries <CBI.TA>, which has about 22 percent of Gamida, in its own statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Gamida said it is developing a pipeline of products to treat a wide range of conditions, including blood cancers and solid tumors. Its StemEx treatment is being tested as part of a transplant regimen for patients with high risk leukaemia and lymphoma [ID:nL5N0CY1CL] The future payments would be conditioned upon meeting milestones in development, registration and sales, Elbit and Clal said. Other Gamida shareholders include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries <TEVA.TA>, Amgen, Denali Ventures, Auriga Ventures and Israel Healthcare Venture.
