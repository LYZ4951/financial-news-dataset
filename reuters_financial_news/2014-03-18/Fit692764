March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Paratus AMC Limited's  (Paratus) UK Residential Mortgage Primary Servicer Ratings to 'RPS2 (Prime)' and  'RPS2 (Subprime)' from 'RPS2-(Prime)' and 'RPS2-(Subprime)'. The agency has also  affirmed the UK Residential Mortgage Special Servicer Rating at 'RSS2'. The rating actions reflect the significant technology enhancements that have  taken place over the last 18 months, increasing the level of automation and  control across the business.   Efficiencies have been made across key primary servicing processes, such as  payment allocations, insurance monitoring and borrower contact.  A newly  implemented interactive voice recognition (IVR) system provides automated call  routing and data protection screening, and its integration with the servicing  system creates an audit trail of call movements and screening results.  New  tools implemented by the company such as a web payment portal and SMS alerts  provide borrowers with a variety of contact and payment methods.  The company continues to strengthen an already robust governance framework  through the implementation of an internally developed quality control system,  providing greater standardisation of the quality assurance review process and  improving oversight and root cause analysis capabilities.   A new outsourcing agreement with an experienced third party supplier provides  the company with an internal audit programme, further enhancing an already  strong risk management framework which includes regular risk assessments. At the  time of review the initial audit cycle was in its infancy and as a result Fitch  is unable yet to make an assessment of its suitability; however, the agency  takes a positive view of the independent review of the company's processes.   The ratings also reflect Paratus's continued use of a mixture of resolution  methods, with a focus on individual borrower's financial position and  affordability, to positive effect.  Fitch continues to take a positive view of  the company's third-party management processes, with tight controls over  decision-making and regular benchmarking activities. Shortfall collection has  been largely insourced since September 2012, with encouraging results.  As of 30 September 2013, the primary servicing portfolio totalled just over  GBP3bn and comprised 30,280 loans.  The securitised portfolio consists of 21  transactions, representing 99% of the total primary servicing portfolio by  value.  This compares with 20 transactions in 2012, following the securitisation  of a number of re-performing loans.  The Virgil Mortgages No.1 transaction was  completed during 1H13, with Paratus retaining all servicing duties.
