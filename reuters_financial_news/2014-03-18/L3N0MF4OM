SYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - Singapore's CapitaLand Ltd <CATL.SI> said on Wednesday it has sold its remaining 39.1 percent stake in Australia's Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX> for around $849 million.

Australian property developer Stockland Corp <SGP.AX> said it bought a strategic 19.9 percent stake in Australand at an average price of A$3.78 per stapled security, a 3 percent discount to Australand's closing price of A$3.89 price on Tuesday. Last year CapitaLand cut its stake in Australand to 39.1 percent from 59.1 percent at a loss to pursue "new opportunities", despite an earlier strategic review that concluded Australand was a key investment.
