WELLINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - New Zealand's annual current account deficit narrowed to the lowest in nearly two years as an increase in exports boosted the trade surplus, according to data released by Statistics New Zealand on Wednesday.

The annual deficit to Dec. 31 fell to NZ$7.55 billion ($6.52 billion), equalling 3.4 percent of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters forecast an actual deficit for the quarter of NZ$1.4 billion and for the year of NZ$7.41 billion, equating to 3.3 percent of GDP. The balance on goods and surpluses was NZ$1.82 billion, driven by a strong lift in dairy exports, while imports fell. The seasonally-adjusted deficit for the quarter of NZ$837 million was the lowest in more than three years, and the seasonally adjusted goods and services surplus was a record high. The country's net foreign liabilities, measured by international investment positions, was 66.6 percent of GDP, the lowest in 11 years, from a revised 69.2 percent in the previous quarter, as the value of New Zealand owned assets overseas outstripped the rise in liabilities. The government agency said there were NZ$1.07 billion in reinsurance settlements relating to the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010/11, with an estimated NZ$5.92 billion of claims still outstanding.
