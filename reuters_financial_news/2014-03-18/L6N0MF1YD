LAGOS, March 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria plans to raise 972.51 billion Nigerian naira ($5.91 billion) via Treasury bills ranging between 3-month and 1-year maturities in the second quarter of the year, the central bank said on Tuesday.

Nigeria's central bank holds treasury bill auctions twice a month on behalf of the Debt Management Office (DMO) to raise funds via short-tenor paper to finance the government's budget deficit. In March, the central bank plans to raise 221.91 billion naira in 91-day, 182-day and 1-year treasury bills, while in April, the regulator will auction 334.25 billion naira worth of treasury bills of the same maturities.
