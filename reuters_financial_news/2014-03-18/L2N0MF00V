BRASILIA, March 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's finance ministry on Monday changed the way borrowing costs are calculated on 13.9 billion reais ($5.9) of loans to the state development bank BNDES, reducing the bank's interest payments.

The loans, which include eight different debt contracts, will be calculated according to the country's TJLP long-term interest rate that BNDES uses as a benchmark on its loans, the ministry said in a statement. The TJLP has been set at 5 percent since early 2013. The move will allow BNDES to pay the government the same amount of interest it receives from the private companies it issues loans to, according to the finance ministry. The bank, Brazil's main source for long-term corporate loans, lends to companies at borrowing costs below the benchmark overnight SELIC lending rate.  Currently the eight contracts are pegged to yields linked to the inflation-indexed rates as calculated by the IPCA consumer price rates and the so-called TR savings rate. The lower interest payments could cost the government and taxpayers cash at a time when public finances are expanding public debt, a trend that has spurred concerns over a possible credit downgrade. The ministry did not say how it would make up for eventual revenue losses.
