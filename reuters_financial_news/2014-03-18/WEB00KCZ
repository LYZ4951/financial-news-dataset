PARIS, March 18 (Reuters) - Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, France's No. 2 listed bank, said it would offer to buy out minority holders of its online bank brand Boursorama <FMTX.PA> representing approximately 23 percent of the unit's ownership.

SocGen said on Tuesday it would file an offer of 12 euros ($16.71) per Boursorama share with the French AMF regulator, or a premium of 22 percent versus Boursorama's Monday closing price of 9.83 euros.  If more than 95 percent of minority investors successfully tender their shares, SocGen will proceed with a mandatory delisting.
