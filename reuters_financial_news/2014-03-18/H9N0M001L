HONG KONG, March 18 (Reuters) - Early modest gains for China shares were largely erased on Tuesday afternoon on declines by property stocks following home-price data and concern that a local developer could default.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended the day up 0.1 percent at 2,025.19 points.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings shed 0.2 percent. Early in the day, both indexes were up, helped by gains for Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS> on a report that the distiller would spin off some assets. Property stocks were hurt by pricing data indicating the sector is losing some steam. A mainland media report that a local developer could default on a large loan added pressure on the already soft business. [ID:nENNE3H0RV]
