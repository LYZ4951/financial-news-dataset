WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - A unit of Citigroup Inc <C.N> will pay $1.1 million to settle civil charges it violated certain short-selling rules designed to reduce market manipulation risks, a Wall Street-funded regulator and BATS Global Markets announced Tuesday.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Citigroup Global Markets violated what is known as Rule 105 of "Regulation M," which prohibits a trader from shorting stock prior to a public offering, then buying the same stock through the offering.
