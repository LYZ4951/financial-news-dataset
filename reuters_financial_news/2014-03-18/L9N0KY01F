LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The Bank of England announced further changes to its top management on Tuesday, naming Andy Haldane, currently the BoE's executive director for financial stability, as its chief economist from June.

He will replace Spencer Dale who will take on a similar role to Haldane's current position and will leave the Monetary Policy Committee, the BoE said.
