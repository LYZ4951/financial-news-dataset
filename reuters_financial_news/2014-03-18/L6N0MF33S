LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - Russia's debt insurance costs fell and its dollar debt rose on Tuesday after president Vladimir Putin said Russia did not need further division of Ukraine.

The cost of insuring Ukraine's debt rose, however. "The market is starting to price normalisation of the situation in Ukraine," said Regis Chatellier, emerging markets strategist at Societe Generale.  "The probability that things could get worse in eastern Ukraine is reducing." Russia's five-year credit default swaps fell 16 basis points from Monday's close to 254 bps, according to Markit, and the country's 2043 dollar bond <US78307ADH3=TE> rose 4 cents on the dollar to 96, according to Tradeweb. Ukraine's 5-year CDS rose 39 bps to 1,267 bps.
