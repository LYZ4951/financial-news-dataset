March 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Abu Dhabi-based Tourism Development & Investment Company's [ABDHTT.UL] (TDIC) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'AA', and its Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'. The Outlook for the Long-Term IDR is Stable.  TDIC's global medium-term note programme, TDIC Finance Limited's outstanding  notes and TDIC Sukuk Limited's outstanding notes have also been affirmed at  'AA'.  TDIC's ratings are aligned with the Abu Dhabi sovereign (AA/Stable/F1+),  reflecting strong ties with the sovereign.  Key Rating Drivers State Support Key to Ratings  The ratings are primarily driven by TDIC's strong relationship with the Emirate  of Abu Dhabi, based on Fitch's parent and subsidiary rating linkage methodology.  The agency would not be able to rate TDIC on a standalone basis, due to its  limited operational assets.   Consistent State Funding The state has consistently provided TDIC with substantial direct financial  support, including the provision of free land, recognised by TDIC as equity  contributions. In 2013, the government provided a cash contribution of more than  AED2bn.  Long-term State Ownership  TDIC was established in 2005 through Emiri Decree No. 12. It is fully owned by  the state via the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority (TCA Abu Dhabi), which  is mandated to promote economic diversification through supporting and expanding  the Abu Dhabi tourism industry. TDIC's 100% state ownership status is mandated  by law and is unlikely to change. It can only be dissolved after 2105 (100 years  from its formation) by Emiri decree, or if its mandate is deemed complete.   State Development Strategy TDIC's mission, as set forth by the government, is to develop and manage Abu  Dhabi's tourism investment zones; it is equipped to act as master developer for  large-scale tourism projects. TDIC works closely with private-sector developers,  the involvement of which is a key part of the government's broader economic  strategy.   Unaffected by Public Debt Policy  TDIC, along with Abu Dhabi's four major state-owned enterprises (SOEs),  including a further two rated by Fitch - Mubadala Development Company PJSC [MUDEV.UL], and  International Petroleum Investment Company PJSC [INPTV.UL] are unaffected by the emirate's  recently approved public debt policy.  Fitch continues to apply its parent and subsidiary rating linkage methodology in  rating these entities, as we believe that implicit state support from the  Emirate of Abu Dhabi [ABUDB.UL] has not changed from that previously announced. Fitch does  not rate the fourth of the emirate's largest SOEs - Abu Dhabi National Energy  Company PJSC [TAQA.AD].

RATING SENSITIVITIES A change to the sovereign ratings of Abu Dhabi would probably lead to a similar  change in TDIC's ratings.
