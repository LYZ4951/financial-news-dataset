SYDNEY, March 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares rebounded from one-month lows to add 0.6 percent on Tuesday after Wall St climbed overnight and major miners found support as copper steadied.

The 'Big Four' banks all rose, with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> added 0.8 percent and National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> climbed 0.9 percent. Second-tier Bank of Queensland Ltd <BOQ.AX> was up 1.9 percent at A$12.70 after it touched a 4-1/2 year high of A$12.80 earlier in the session. "We think the market is going to go higher, probably led by the banks over the next four to six weeks," said Shawn Hickman, managing director at Market Matters in Sydney. "The banks historically put on five and six percent in March and April going into the May dividends so we're bullish around the banks." The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> climbed 35 points to 5,352.6 by 0114 GMT. The benchmark fell 0.2 percent on Monday to one-month lows.  The Australian market touched a 5-1/2 year peak of 5,462.3 on March 7 but has since drifted lower as tensions in Ukraine and weak economic data from China have weighed on sentiment.  A rise in copper prices underpinned miners. Buyers had been initially attracted by low copper prices after a sharp drop last week. BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> jumped 1.9 percent and  Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> gained 1.2 percent.  A handful of defensives also posted gains, Australia's largest telecommunications provider Telstra Corporation Ltd <TLS.AX> added 0.4 percent while consumer staple retailer Wesfarmers Ltd <WES.AX> rose 0.3 percent.  Elsewhere, stocks in the gold sector were on the back foot as bullion posted a loss of 1.2 percent overnight; Newcrest Mining Ltd <NCM.AX> fell 5.1 percent and Beadell Resources Ltd <BDR.AX> dropped 5.8 percent  Australia's central bank said on Tuesday recent economic developments had strengthened its view that interest rates can remain low for some time to come, citing a pick-up in consumption and housing that was offset by a still subdued labour market and slow wage growth.
