MUMBAI, March 18 (Reuters) - Indian shares rallied to record highs on Tuesday as strong buying by foreign investors continued to bolster blue chips in the lead-up to general elections, especially companies more geared towards the domestic economy such as HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS>.

Still, a bout of profit-taking erased most of the gains by the end of the session as the recent pace of gains is raising the prospect of near-term consolidation. India's broader NSE index <.NSEI> provisionally ended up 0.19 percent after gaining as much as 1.1 percent to a record high of 6,574.95, surpassing its previous record high hit on March 11.
