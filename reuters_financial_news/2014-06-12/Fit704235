June 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a recently  published comment that more investors are subscribing to delayed drawdown bonds  where they commit to subscribe to bonds periodically throughout the project's  construction phase. This has the advantage of reducing costs of carry compared  with a full upfront drawing but places more emphasis on the credit quality of  the investor. The ability of each investor to meet drawdown requirements on a timely basis is  critical. The failure of one to meet its obligations in full and on time may  mean that the company has insufficient funds to continue construction, leading  to default. To assess this risk requires an examination of the investment  structure of a particular transaction, which may involve rated or unrated  investors, major funds of rated institutions or asset managers investing funds  from their own group or from third parties. Fitch considers a variety of aspects in its analysis such as the investors'  creditworthiness; the size and liquidity position of the underlying funds; the  legal and contractual relationships between a manager and the funds it manages;  the linkage between an investor and its parent company; and the level of direct  or indirect exposure of the investment manager. The agency relies on the issuers  to provide this information. Fitch also draws on the expertise of its Insurance  and Fund ratings groups as required.
