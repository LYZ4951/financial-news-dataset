STOCKHOLM, June 12 (Reuters) - The Swedish financial system is resilient, but banks' dependence on market funding and high debt among households remain two major risks, The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority said on Thursday.

Swedish household debt levels are among the highest in Europe, at around 170 percent of disposable income, and policymakers have introduced several measures in recent years to dampen credit growth and household indebtedness. "In the FSA's opinion, resilience in the Swedish financial system is currently sound, but risks are present, mainly due to a large banking sector that is sensitive to shocks, and the high indebtedness of Swedish households, the watchdog said in its bi-annual financial stability report.
