MILAN, June 12 (Reuters) - Italian lender UniCredit <CRDI.MI> said on Thursday its online unit Fineco will list a 30 percent stake in an initial public offering that could value the company at up to 2.668 billion euros ($3.6 billion).

All the 181.9 million Fineco shares offered to investors before the possible exercise of a greenshoe option, will be sold by UniCredit, Italy's biggest bank by assets, to bolster its balance sheet as it undergoes a Europe-wide health check of lenders. In a statement announcing regulatory approval for the IPO, UniCredit said the shares will be offered at between 3.5 euros and 4.4 euros apiece from June 16 to June 26.
