LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - A consortium including construction firms Carillion <CLLN.L>, Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> and Galliford Try <GFRD.L> has been picked as preferred bidder for a 745 million pound contract to build roads in Scotland, the companies said on Thursday.

The partners will each invest 20 million pounds and claim a third of the construction revenue. The Scottish government's Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route/Balmedie to Tipperty Project is set to be completed in 2018 and, if selected, the preferred bidder consortium will manage and maintain the route for 30 years.
