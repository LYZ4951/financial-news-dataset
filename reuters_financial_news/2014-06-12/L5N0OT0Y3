DUBAI, June 12 (Reuters) - A $750 million debut sukuk sold on Wednesday by Emaar Malls Group, a division of Dubai's Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU>, has tightened in the secondary market after the issue met strong investor demand.

The 10-year sukuk received orders worth more than $5.4 billion. It priced at a profit rate of 4.564 percent and a spread of 182.5 basis points over mid-swaps, meaning there was almost no new issue premium. The sukuk priced at par and is now trading with bid-offer quotes at 100.40/100.50, traders said early on Thursday.
