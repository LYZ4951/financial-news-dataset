PARIS, June 12 (Reuters) - European shares inched up in early trade on Thursday, although gains were limited by a dip in resource-related shares on renewed concerns over the pace of global growth.

At 0706 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,392.94 points. Miners Rio Tinto <RIO.L> and BHP Billiton <BLT.L> were both down 1.4 percent. A cut by the World Bank of its global growth forecast prompted investors to book recent lofty gains on Wall Street on Wednesday.
