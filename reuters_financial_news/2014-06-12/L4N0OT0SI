KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 (Reuters) - Societe Generale, France's third-largest bank by assets, will raise up to 1 billion ringgit ($311.24 million) with a multi-currency sukuk programme in Malaysia, RAM Ratings said on Thursday.

Last year, people with knowledge of the matter had told Reuters that Societe Generale would issue $300 million worth of Islamic bonds in Malaysia by the end of 2013. Funds from the programme will go towards expanding the bank's operations in the Middle East. [ID:nL6N0G215W]   RAM Ratings gave the bond programme a AAA(s), or stable, rating, saying it reflected the bank's strong presence across Europe and sound capital position. The sukuk will be issued by the bank and a special-purpose vehicle set up as a funding conduit. No details on the sukuk tenure or structure were given.
