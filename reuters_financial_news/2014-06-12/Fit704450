June 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk's <BTPN.JK> (BTPN) ratings, including its National Long-Term rating to 'AA(idn)' with Stable Outlook from 'AA-(idn). Fitch has also simultaneously assigned BTPN a National Short Term Rating of F1+(idn). A full list of rating actions is found at the end of this commentary.  'AA' National Ratings denote expectations of very low default risk relative to  other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default risk inherently  differs only slightly from that of the country's highest rated issuers or  obligations. 'F1' National Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely payment of  financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the same  country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the lowest  default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity profile  is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  Key Rating Drivers The upgrade of BTPN's National Long-Term Rating reflects a higher propensity of  support from its major shareholder Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation [SUMFGI.UL] (SMBC,  'A-'/Stable). SMBC increased its stake in BTPN to 40% from 25% in March 2014.  The rating also reflects SMBC's support in the form of a liquidity facility to  BTPN at the initial amount of US$ 100m and that the operational linkages between  BTPN and SMBC are expected to increase further in future. While BTPN has been SMBC's largest acquisition, Fitch classifies BTPN as being  of limited importance to SMBC in line with its criteria on rating financial  institution subsidiaries and holding companies. The agency believes that  Indonesia is an important market for SMBC given the country's rapid economic  growth. However, the Indonesia-based bank has limited synergies with SMBC and is  likely to continue to operate with significant management independence in the  near term. SMBC also plans to retain the existing BTPN brand and has currently  no plans to share its name and branding with BTPN. BTPN's capitalisation is among the highest in the domestic banking industry. Its  Fitch Capital Core (FCC) ratio stood at 24% and non-performing loan (NPL) ratio  low at 0.4% at end-2013. BTPN's net interest margin (NIM) is also one of the  highest among Indonesian banks, although it has been declining due to tight  competition and higher funding costs. Fitch believes BTPN's capitalisation and  profitability remain solid with satisfactory asset quality in the near to medium  term. Moreover, Fitch expects BTPN's deposit franchise to improve in the long  term when SMBC shows stronger commitment in providing cheaper cost of funds to  BTPN.  Rating Sensitivities Positive rating action may be possible if SMBC becomes a majority shareholder in  BTPN given that SMBC is a higher rated institution. SMBC's greater involvement  in management and stronger integration in areas such as risk management may also  lift BTPN's rating. Conversely, any perceived weakening of support from or  significant dilution in ownership by SMBC would put pressure on BTPN's National  Rating.  The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that BTPN will largely maintain  a steady risk profile over the near to medium term despite more challenging  economic conditions such as political uncertainties and a higher interest rate  environment.
