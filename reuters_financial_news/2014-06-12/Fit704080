June 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings is participating in the annual Global ABS  conference in Barcelona, with a combination of presentations and panel  discussions. Below are some highlights from the key presentations and panels in  which Fitch participated:  Marjan van der Weijden, Managing Director, Head of EMEA Structured Finance:  "As Europe begins to slowly recover, securitisation could play a more prominent  role in helping fund the real economy. Explicit support from policy makers has  identified the use of securitisation as a funding tool for SME lending across  Europe and, from a credit perspective, we believe this is feasible given our  portfolio of rated SME CLO transactions has largely performed in line with  expectations." "However, there are some hurdles to jump before SME CLOs can really take off.  The spreads on the assets, the credit protection and also the spreads investors  are expecting are a challenge to make SME CLOs currently economically viable  without any support from an external or public entity. Furthermore, other real  economy assets such as residential mortgages, consumer loans and auto loans are  not facing the same hurdles and are currently easier to securitise." Gregg Kohansky, Managing Director, Head of EMEA Residential Mortgage Backed  Securities: "Despite the divergence between European core and periphery credit fundamentals  since the financial crisis, European RMBS ratings have performed within  expectations.'AAA' issuance from core countries has largely remained at this  rating level, while 'AAA' issuance from the periphery has been downgraded to the  'A' range - principally due to counterparty and sovereign risks, rather than  underlying asset performance." "The housing and mortgage markets in these two regions will continue to show  differentiation and while we expect to see more asset performance pressure on  the periphery, we are also starting to see some green shoots there, such as in  Ireland where house prices are slowly increasing. In the core, the UK continues  to show robust house price growth, especially in London, and despite our  concerns around the sustainability of recent increases higher-risk lending is  actually on the way down. High loan to value and debt to income lending volumes  are about one-tenth of pre-crisis peak levels."Matthias Neugebauer, Managing Director, Head of EMEA Structured Credit: "European CLOs returned last year with Cairn CLO, the first transaction since  2008. Issuance in 2013 totalled EUR7.5bn and we expect it to exceed EUR10bn for  2014. The primary growth constraints on the market are regulation, in particular  risk retention rules, as well as the availability of loan collateral." "We expect the European Banking Authority's retention rules, which effectively  allow the asset manager to obtain funding for the retention stake, reducing the  amount of capital they require, to help some new smaller asset managers join the  market. The first loan-only European CLO deal to attract US bank investors in  2014 was the Harvest IX transaction. The deal was intended to be Volker  compliant by removing bonds and floating rate notes. However, we expect only a  limited number of European CLOs to follow this trend, as Volker compliance  reduces the investable universe even further."
