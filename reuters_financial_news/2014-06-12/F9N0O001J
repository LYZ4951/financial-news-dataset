FRANKFURT, June 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank reiterated in its monthly bulletin on Thursday its determination to act swiftly with further policy action if needed, adding that it saw no imminent risk of deflation in the euro zone.

As usual, the editorial of the bank's bulletin was virtually identical to its main policy statement, read out by ECB President Mario Draghi last Thursday, when the bank cut interest rates and announced a package of measures to buoy the economy. The ECB said in the editorial that "if required, it will act swiftly with further monetary policy easing."  "The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation," it added. In an article entitled "Is there a risk of deflation in the euro area?", the ECB added: "at the euro area aggregate level, the current situation does not suggest that an outright deflationary episode is imminent". Below is a list of articles and special sections the bulletin contains. The articles can often shed light on the ECB's thinking about key issues and give an insight into the type of analysis the bank uses to support its policy decisions.  * Recent developments in MFI loans to non-financial corporations, broken down by economic sector * Recent developments in the financial account of the euro area balance of payments * Liquidity conditions and monetary policy operations in the period from 12 February 2014 to 13 May 2014 * The role of global factors in recent developments in euro area inflation * Risk of deflation? * Recent trends in household real disposable income * Survey evidence on investment developments across SMEs and large firms * Fiscal councils in EU countries * June 2014 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area
