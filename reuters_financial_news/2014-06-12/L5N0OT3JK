MILAN, June 12 (Reuters) - The Milan stock exchange has given the green light to the listing of shares in Italian state-owned ship maker Fincantieri, it said in a statement on Thursday.

The initial public offering of a minority stake in the company is part of a privatisation programme launched by the Italian government in 2013 to help cut its public debt.
