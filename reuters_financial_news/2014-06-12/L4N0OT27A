JAKARTA, June 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's government wants to rescue grounded domestic carrier PT Merpati Nusantara Airlines, the country's chief economic minister said, potentially by converting its heavy debts into equity, a cheaper solution than allowing the state-owned airline to go bankrupt.

Merpati, struggling to pay insurance, employee salaries and fuel bills, hasn't been permitted to operate flights since February. "We know that Merpati is facing difficulties (repaying) its debts, so we will continue with efforts to rescue it," chief economic minister Chairul Tanjung said on Thursday  after a meeting with state-owned enterprises minister Dahlan Iskan in Jakarta.
