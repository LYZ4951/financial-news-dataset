TORONTO, June 12 (Reuters) - Canadian home prices rose in May but the pace of 12-month home price appreciation decelerated slightly, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index showed on Thursday.

The index, which measures price changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed national home prices rose 0.8 percent last month, a modest reading compared to historical May readings for what is traditionally one of the strongest sales months of the year.
