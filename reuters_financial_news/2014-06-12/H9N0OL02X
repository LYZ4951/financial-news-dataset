HONG KONG, June 12 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished lower on Thursday, joining other Asian markets in slipping after Wall Street stepped back from record levels.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.4 percent at 23,175.02 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong slid 0.7 percent. Leading losses in the benchmark index was China Mengniu Dairy <2319.HK>, which sank nearly 3 percent after Macquarie Research downgraded it to "underperform" from "neutral", citing risks from a subsidiary and competition from imported ultra heat treated milk.  Mengniu shares have fallen more than 16 percent from mid-April highs.
