The Genoa-based bank said in a statement it would offer 93 new shares every 25 already held at a price of 0.10 euros e ach. The capital increase starts on June 16. Carige's cash call comes as bigger rival Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> is also seeking to raise 5 billion euros in a share sale that started this week. [ID:nL5N0OR44L] Monte Paschi offered a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price.  Carige's rights issue runs until July 4. A group of banks led by Mediobanca and including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UniCredit, Commerzbank and Nomura has committed to buy any unsold shares.
