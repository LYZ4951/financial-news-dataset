MILAN, June 12 (Reuters) - The Italian bourse and the stock market watchdog defended the handling of Monte dei Paschi di Siena's <BMPS.MI> 5 billion euro ($6.8 billion) share sale, with one top official saying the failure of the underlying stock to trade was marginal and "extraordinary" work had been done on the issue.

The stock did not trade on Monday - the first day of the highly dilutive fundraising - or on the following day, due to a physical dearth of new shares linked to the sheer size of the sale. That prompted criticism from traders that the Milan stock exchange and market watchdog Consob should have predicted the turbulence and taken measures to offset it. "It was handled very well, the work done has been extraordinary," said Raffaele Jerusalmi, head of the Italian Bourse, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L>. On Monday and Tuesday, the shares were only allowed to change hands at the closing bell, logging gains of 20 percent each day on thin volume, before falling 20 percent on Wednesday after multiple suspensions for excessive losses. [ID:nL5N0OS1SS] On Thursday, the stock - which is trading without the rights to buy into the cash call - stabilised and by 1441 GMT was down 0.85 percent to 1.76 euros. The rights, which trade separately, were not affected by the disruptions. On Thursday they fell 3 percent at 17.8 euros.  "A big mess has been kicked up for something marginal, because 95 percent of Monte dei Paschi's capital - the rights -have been traded since the first day," Jerusalmi said.  HIGHLY DILUTIVE   The head of stock market watchdog Consob, Giuseppe Vegas, said the volatility had to be expected given the highly dilutive effect of the operation. "It's clear that you are going to have this kind of movements, but the situation has been monitored. We gave warnings and everybody was alerted," he said.  "The market situation is returning to normal," the bank's CEO, Fabrizio Viola, said. "Let's not forget that the size of the capital increase is significant." Monte Paschi's cash call- which it needs to repay state aid and bolster its finances in view of a pan-European health check of lenders - is nearly twice the bank's pre-fundraising stock market value of 2.9 billion euros.  It will increase the number of Monte dei Paschi shares in circulation to around 5.117 billion from 117 million. However, those shares will not be materially available until the end of June at the earliest, meaning a shortage of shares that can distort market prices and push the stock artificially higher, traders said.  Under the cash call, existing shareholders got the right to buy 214 shares for every five shares held at 1 euro apiece. That implied a 96 percent discount to the previous closing market price of around 25 euros and a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) of 1.55 euros, which takes account of the dilutive effect of the new shares.  Based on Thursday's prices, investors buying the rights and exercising them would pay 1.42 euros for each new share, a discount to the market price and also to the TERP. That gap is expected to narrow as the offer period progresses.
