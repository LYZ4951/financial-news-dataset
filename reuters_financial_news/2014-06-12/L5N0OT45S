LISBON, June 12 (Reuters) - Shares in Millennium bcp <BCP.LS>, Portugal's second largest listed bank, slumped nearly 8 percent on Thursday on talk the bank may be preparing a capital increase, traders said.

At 1500 GMT shares in Millennium were 8.08 percent lower at 0.1751 euros a share, after earlier hitting a low of 0.1721. The Lisbon benchmark PSI20 <.PSI20> index was 1.01 percent lower. "There are rumours of a capital increase, there is talk of 2 billion euros and that's leading to the fall in the shares," said Albino Oliveira, an analyst at the Fincor brokerage.

Millennium's competitor - Banco Espirito Santo - completed a rights issue of 1 billion euros on Wednesday.
