MUMBAI, June 12 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged higher on Thursday as blue-chips such as HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> rose on hopes that economic data due later in the day may show easing retail inflation and a pick-up in industrial activity.

A Reuters survey of economists found consumer price inflation <INCPIY=ECI> probably eased to 8.4 percent in May, from April's three-month high of 8.59 percent as food prices fell slightly. [ID:nL4N0OR3HF] India's factory output probably rose for the first time in April since January, to reflect healthy growth in core industries, while consumer prices likely eased in May, a Reuters poll found. However, investors expect some consolidation ahead of the new government's budget due to be unveiled by mid-July. Also, overseas investors sold Indian shares worth 3.13 billion rupees ($52.87 million) on Wednesday, provisional exchange data shows, marking their first sales since May 29. "We are now looking forward to the new government's execution of the budget. There is some consolidation happening. As more clarity comes there would be further upside though," said Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance.
