WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday proposed changing the dates by which banks must submit their annual stress tests measuring their ability to withstand financial shocks.

The biggest banks with more than $50 billion of total assets would need to submit their plans by April 5, three months later than under the current rule makings.
