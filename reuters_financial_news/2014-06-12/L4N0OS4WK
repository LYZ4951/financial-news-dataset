WELLINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank will deliver another two rate rises this year as it looks to impose its control on budding inflation pressures in the strongly performing economy, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on Thursday raised its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent, as expected, holding firmly to the view that it needs to keep raising rates although the strength of the economic data and the currency will dictate the pace of tightening. There had been speculation that the RBNZ would give a strong hint of a pause in its tightening cycle given soft inflation pressures, which have been cooled in part by the high currency, but it left forecasts of rates and inflation virtually unchanged. "The RBNZ is showing very little sign it is about to deviate from the path it laid out in March, which showed around 125 basis points of OCR (official cash rate) hikes over 2014," said ASB Bank chief economist Nick Tuffley. A Reuters poll after the RBNZ's statement showed nine of 13 economists expecting a further 25 basis point rise in July, with three expecting the next rise in September, and one looking to March 2015. However, analysts expect a second rise in either the September or more likely in the December monetary statement, unchanged from a poll before the latest decision. This is a Reuters poll of economists' expectations for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) official cash rate review on July 24.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  RBNZ official cash rate review, July 24, 9 am (2100 GMT) NEXT MOVE   JULY RISK (%)   SEPT  DEC   MARCH JUNEbps   +25  N/C  -25ANZ(July +25)   55   450   3.50  3.50  3.75  4.00  ASB(July +25)   60   400   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  BNZ(July +25)   75   250   3.50  4.00  4.25  4.50  Citi   (Sept +25)   40   600   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  Deutsche   (July +25)   75   250   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  Goldman  (Mch'15 +25)   45   550   3.25  3.25  3.50  3.75  IFR Markets(Sept +25)   45   532   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.00  Infometrics(Sept +25)   40   600   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.50  JP Morgan  (July +25)   60   355   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  RBC(July +25)   75   250   3.50  3.50  3.75  4.00  TD Secs(July +25)   70   300   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  UBS(July +25)   60   400   3.75  4.00  4.25  4.50  Westpac(July +25)   55   450   3.50  3.75  3.75  4.00
