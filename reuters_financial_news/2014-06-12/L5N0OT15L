VIENNA, June 12 (Reuters) - Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska plans to raise his stake in Austrian construction firm Strabag <STRV.VI> to 25 percent from 19.4 percent, according to a regulatory filing.

Austria's competition authority said in a statement posted on its website that Deripaska's Rasperia Trading Ltd investment vehicle had notified it of its intention to buy a further 5.6 percent of Strabag. Deripaska has an option valid until July to boost his stake to 25 percent - a level he previously held - via purchases from other core shareholders: the Haselsteiner group, Raiffeisen NOe-Wien [RZB.UL] bank and insurer Uniqa <UNIQ.VI>. "We do not know whether and to what extent it will actually be exercised," Strabag said in an emailed statement on Thursday. Currently, Uniqa and Raiffeisen hold a joint stake of 29.3 percent of Strabag, the Haselsteiner family 28.3 percent and Deripaska 19.4 percent. Ten percent is held by the company as treasury shares, leaving a free float of 13 percent.
