June 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that full rating alignment of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with their sovereigns is rare. In our EMEA corporate portfolio, only 15% of SOEs benefit from full rating alignment, with 48% rated on a standalone basis and 20% rated bottom-up from  their standalone ratings. Our approach to determining support-driven rating  linkages is driven by the strength of strategic, legal and operational ties. For full rating alignment, companies must usually be considered strategic to the  state and be majority state-owned, the state should be closely involved in  setting the strategic direction of the entity (through appointing the board,  approving budgets or funding capex), and significant financial assistance should  be present (including a track record and/or the expectation of significant debt  guarantees, subsidies, equity injections or other sources of state funding). Regional support regimes also affect the strength of linkages. Notably, EU law  formally prohibits the provision of state financial assistance to competitive  industries, limiting the number of SOEs linked to their sovereigns relative to  other regions, notably emerging markets (EMs). In the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS), our assessment of state support is more selective.  While, for example, the Russian State publishes a lengthy list of strategic  industries it would be unlikely to support all of these in times of stress. This  compares with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries where governments  have traditionally been very supportive of SOEs and most rated entities have  close ties to the rulers, with no constitutional or political obstacles to  direct financial aid. Where legal, operational and strategic ties justify linkage between the rating  of the SOE and the sovereign rating, the approach to and extent of notching can  also vary over time. The likelihood of support may be dynamic, as the strategic  and operational significance of an SOE to the sovereign may evolve. Similarly,  events may occur, or previously undisclosed information may come to light, that  alter our assessment of the likelihood of government support for particular  entities or sectors, leading us to revise our notching.
