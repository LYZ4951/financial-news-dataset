JAKARTA, June 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's government has dropped a plan for PT Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> to buy PT Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN) <BBTN.JK>, the chief economic minister said on Thursday.

Chairul Tanjung told reporters that the banks are not compatible enough for a merger. "BTN as a bank that specialises in housing (loans) cannot be merged with a more commercial bank like Mandiri," Chairul Tanjung said. The cabinet secretary in April had called for a delay in the planned acquisition, sending BTN's share price down sharply. [ID:nL3N0NG239]
