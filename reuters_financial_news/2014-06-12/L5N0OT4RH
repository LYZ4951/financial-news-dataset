LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - An unusual clause in Argentina's $100 billion debt restructuring could give its current generation of investors a boost in the coming days if the U.S. Supreme Court acts as expected.

The United States' top court met behind closed doors on Thursday to consider Argentina's appeal of a lower court's decision that it should pay in full a group of hedge fund creditors that refused to be part of its 2005 and 2010 restructurings. [ID:nL2N0OR0P1]  An announcement from the high court will come Monday at the earliest and though the Argentine government has warned a loss in the high-profile litigation could see it default on its debt, financial markets are wagering there will be no such drama.Many of the bonds investors got in the debt swap are now near two year highs. The cost of default protection has slumped as buyers see the 10 percent plus return these bonds offer as too tempting to ignore and bet a default is many months away at worst.Their optimism comes down to a view that rather than making a straight call either way on the appeal, the Supreme Court is more likely to keep the process dragging on by asking President Barack Obama's Solicitor General for his views on the case.The U.S. government has backed Argentina's stance in the past, but whether or not the Solicitor General supports Argentina's position may not matter to investors. More important could be the time it takes. An expiry date of December 31 this year was written into an otherwise standard promise Argentina gave to the restructured bond holders, that others who did not participate would not get a sweeter deal. Such promises are common in sovereign debt restructurings. What is unusual about the "rights upon future offers" (RUFO) clause Argentina offered to bondholders was that it had an end date that is now almost up.  If the RUFO expires, Argentina would be in a better position to do a deal with so-called holdout investors, potentially bringing the decade-long fight to a welcome close. "If we don't get a decision one way or the other from the Supreme Court then that is immediately bullish (for Argentine assets)," said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Investment Management in London. "It defers, and in my view, significantly reduces default risk in Argentina... after the expiry of the favoured creditor RUFO clause, the incentives for a negotiated solution improve." <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Preview of Supreme Court case [ID:nL2N0OR0P1]Argentina's upcoming bond payments[ID:nL1N0OE0TN]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   While many U.S. legal experts expect the Supreme Court to bow to its government's wishes and hear the appeal after it receives the Solicitor General's view, it is certainly not a given.  Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal, a law professor at Queen Mary University of London who specialises in sovereign debt restructuring, points out the court only usually hears around 100 of the 8,000 - 9,000 appeals it receives each year. Of those 100 or so, many often come from decisions that ended up being split or having questions marks raised about them, something that wasn't the case in Argentina's last appeal in August last year. [ID:nL2N0GO0O3]  In a scenario where the Supreme Court makes a swift decision that goes against Argentina, a broad spread of Argentine assets, from other types of bonds, to stocks <.MAR> and its peso currency <ARS=> would be hurt. But Argentina's progress with IMF measures, such as relaxing its control over the peso [ID:nL2N0KY0FC], a deal with the Paris Club to repay some of it overdue debts, plus the prospect of a new President, could soften the market reaction, says Gorky Urquieta, co-head of emerging market debt at U.S.-based fund Neuberger Berman."Even if Argentina does go into technical default, the reaction in the market is likely to be far less severe than it would have been a year or so ago because the next government is more likely to be able to fix it," he said."And come Jan. 1 2015 Argentina can negotiate with the holdouts."(Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by Andrew Hay)  Keywords: ARGENTINA BONDS/SUPREMECOURT
