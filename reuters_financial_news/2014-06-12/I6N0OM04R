MILAN, June 12 (Reuters) - Shares in bailed-out Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> rose 1 percent in early trade on Thursday, after a 20 percent drop the previous.

Monte Paschi launched on Monday a 5 billion euro ($6.8 billion) capital increase and its shares failed to trade on the first two days of the highly dilutive share sale due to a number of technical reasons. By 0707 GMT shares, without rights, in the bank were flat against a 0.4 percent drop in Italy's banking stock index <.FTIT8300>. The rights were trading down 1 percent at 18.2 euros.
