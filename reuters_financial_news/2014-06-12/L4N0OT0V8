MANILA, June 12 (Reuters) - Philippine lenders can have greater real estate exposure as long as they have enough capital buffers to stem risks identified in an industry stress test, the central bank said, as it issued new rules aimed at reducing risks arising from a growing property market.

The new regulation, which came ahead of a rate policy review on June 19, is a "preemptive macro-prudential policy measure" to ensure that banks' real estate exposure remains healthy, the central bank said in a statement late on Wednesday night.  But it said the new measure "does not reflect any imminent vulnerability among banks with exposure to the real estate sector." Stress tests will be conducted under the new prudential guideline to determine whether banks' capital is sufficient to absorb credit risk related to real estate lending and investments. [ID:nL3N0O62IM] At present, Philippine banks are required to meet a capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent, higher than a Basel II requirement of 8 percent.  Under the new rules, banks must meet the same capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent after adjusting for the stress test results, the central bank said.   Also factoring in the stress test, universal and commercial banks and their thrift lending units must have 6 percent of their qualified capital classified as common equity tier 1 (CET1), or the safest and highest quality capital that can absorb shocks excluding preferred shares or non-controlling interests.  The CET1 requirement is also higher than a minimum set under the Basel III framework.  Stand-alone thrift banks must maintain a 6 percent total tier 1 capital of their qualified capital. Prior to the new rule, banks' real estate lending was capped at only up to 20 percent of their total outstanding loans.
