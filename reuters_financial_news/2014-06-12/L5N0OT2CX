DUBAI, June 12 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi government-owned Al Hilal Bank may sell a benchmark-sized Tier 1 capital-boosting dollar sukuk issue after announcing plans to meet fixed income investors, a document from lead managers said on Thursday.

The Islamic lender, owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, has chosen itself as well as Citigroup <C.N>, Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>, HSBC <HSBA.L>, National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> and Standard Chartered <STAN.L> to arrange roadshows in the Middle East, Asia and Europe starting June 15. A benchmark-sized, dollar-denominated perpetual sukuk offering may follow, subject to market conditions, the document added. Traditionally, benchmark size is understood to mean at least $500 million.
