BANGKOK, June 12 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares retreated on Thursday amid foreign-led selling in large caps after the central bank maintained interest rates as expected, while Thai index fell for the second session, with index heavyweight energy and banking stocks leading the pack.

Indonesia's central bank left its policy rate unchanged at 7.5 percent to support the economy as slowing exports pile pressure on the current account.
