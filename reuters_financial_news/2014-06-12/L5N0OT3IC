MILAN, June 12 (Reuters) - The Milan stock exchange said on Thursday it had given the green light to the listing of shares in Fineco, the online banking unit of Italian lender UniCredit <CRDI.MI>.

UniCredit plans to list between 25 percent and 35 percent of Fineco by the end of July to bolster its balance sheet as it undergoes a Europe-wide health check of lenders. The online bank unit could be worth up to 3.5 billion euros ($4.77 billion), according to reports from two investment banks involved in the operation.
