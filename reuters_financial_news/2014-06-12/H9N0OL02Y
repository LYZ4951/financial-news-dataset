HONG KONG, June 12 (Reuters) - China shares edged lower on Thursday as optimism brought by Beijing's mini-stimulus measures faded, though port shares were strong after Beijing detailed a plan to develop the Yangtze river region.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> slipped 0.2 percent at 2,051.71 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.3 percent. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday the government should develop a comprehensive transport network in order to create an "economic belt" along the Yangtze river, according to the government's official website.
