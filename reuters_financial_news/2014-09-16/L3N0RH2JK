BANGKOK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Singapore shares fell to more than five-week lows on Tuesday amid a selloff in property stocks, while other markets in Southeast Asia were flat-to-weaker as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's meeting for clues on U.S. monetary policy.

Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> fell for a third day, down 0.8 percent to 3,285.71, the lowest since Aug. 8. Shares of property developers such as CapitaLand <CATL.SI>, extended Monday's falls due to weak monthly sales data.[ID:nS8N0MZ01Q] The cautious mood prompted broad selling, with Noble Group <NOBG.SI> and Genting Singapore <GENS.SI> among the top losers. In Jakarta, the Composite Index <.JKSE> was a tad lower after a range-bound session, while the Philippine index <.PSI> gained modestly, rebounding from a near two-week closing low on Monday.  The Thai SET index <.SETI> rose slightly. Broker KGI Securities expects a possible weakness in the index but the SET is unlikely to move below 1,550 from the current level of 1,581.63. "Expectation on Fed signal was more mixed after U.S. factory output slowed, which may show that the U.S. economic recovery has yet to be broad-based and an imminent interest rate hike may be unnecessary," KGI Securities said in a report.[ID:nL1N0RB1GL][ECONUS] Energy shares were mixed, with PTT <PTT.BK> up 0.6 percent and PTT Global Chemical <PTTGC.BK> down 0.8 percent, as the government restructures the energy industry, including a potential reform. "PTT stands to gain the most from the reform through NGV and LPG re-pricing," said KGI. "On the other hand, PTTGC stands to lose as much as 3.4-5.2 billion baht a year to its bottom-line or 10-15 percent to fiscal year 2015F estimates." Elsewhere, Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> dropped 1 percent as cautious investors offloaded stocks because of two exchange-traded funds' review week.
