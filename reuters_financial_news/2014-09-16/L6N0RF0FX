DUBAI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> has set initial price thoughts in the 95 basis points area over midswaps for its debut five-year, benchmark-sized U.S. dollar Islamic bond issue, a document from lead managers showed on Tuesday.

The investment bank finished two days of investor meetings in the Middle East on Sept. 11. Goldman picked itself, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD>, Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>, National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, QInvest and the investment banking arm of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank <IPO-NACO.SE> to arrange the investor meetings. The sukuk is being issued through a vehicle called JANY Sukuk Co and will be guaranteed by Goldman Sachs.
