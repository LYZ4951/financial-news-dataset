SOFIA, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's central bank on Tuesday extended its supervision of Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) until Nov. 20, by which point it said a final decision should be taken on the fate of the troubled lender.

The central bank took control of Corpbank <6C9.BB>, Bulgaria's fourth biggest lender, in June and closed down its operations after a run on deposits triggered the country's worst banking crisis since the 1990s. In a statement, the central bank said it had extended supervision for two months until Nov. 20. It said a solution was not possible until a clear estimate of the bank's asset quality and capital adequacy due by Oct. 20.
