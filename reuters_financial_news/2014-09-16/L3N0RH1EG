SEOUL, Sept 16 (Reuters) - South Korea's government will maintain its expansionary macroeconomic policy until "tangible" results are seen, Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said at a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday.

"The new economic team will revitalise the sluggish economy by implementing policies in an assertive manner while tackling the structural problems in order for the Korean people to feel confident of economic improvement," Choi said.
