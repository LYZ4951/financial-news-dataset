Sept 16 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc <AGN.N> said it has reached an agreement with suitors Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc <VRX.TO> to hold a special shareholder meeting on the originally scheduled date, Dec. 18.

Pershing Square and Valeant will also dismiss their pending litigation before the Delaware Court of Chancery, Allergan said in a statement late Monday. [ID:nBw2jC9zDa] Ackman's Pershing Square and Canada's Valeant sued the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment last month, alleging that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal. Allergan subsequently set the meeting date for Dec. 18. [ID:nL1N0QX024] Pershing Square and Valeant made a $52 billion hostile offer for Allergan in April. Since then Allergan has been fighting for investor support for its own stand-alone plan that includes cost cuts and making an acquisition of its own. To force the company to the table, Ackman has been pushing for a special meeting where he hopes to replace most board members with his own nominees, who he expects will be more receptive to Valeant's bid.
