LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The British arm of Spanish bank Santander <SAN.MC> formally started the succession process on Tuesday for a new chief executive, with former Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> executive Nathan Bostock considered the hot favourite for the job.

Santander UK CEO Ana Botin was last week appointed chairwoman of the Madrid-based Santander Group following the death of her father Emilio. [ID:nL5N0RB4RV] The British arm's board met on Tuesday and said in a statement that Bostock had assumed responsibility for operations and strategy, but it stopped short of naming him as the permanent replacement.
