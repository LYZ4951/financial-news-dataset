FRANKFURT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm Blackstone <BX.N> is acquiring two office towers in Frankfurt, Germany, for a combined 350 million euros ($453 million) to bolster its real estate business, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday

Blackstone has clinched a deal with GLL Real Estate Partners to buy the MesseTurm office tower, Frankfurt's second-tallest building, two sources told Reuters. The price tag was 250 million euros, one of them added.  Earlier on Tuesday, German real estate group IVG Immobilien <IVGG.DE> said it had agreed to sell another Frankfurt high-rise called Pollux to Blackstone, which people familiar with the matter said was a deal worth more than 100 million euros. Blackstone declined to comment on the MesseTurm deal, while GLL was not immediately available to comment.  Blackstone had $279 billion in assets under management at the end of June, $80 billion of which in real estate. IVG, the co-owner of London's landmark "Gherkin" tower, earlier this year escaped insolvency when investors approved a proposed debt-for-equity swap. [ID:nWEB00KJH]
