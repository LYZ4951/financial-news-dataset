NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - British communications and events company UBM Plc <UBM.L> is in advanced talks to acquire trade show organizing company Advanstar for around $900 million, according to people familiar with the matter.

UBM, which also owns PR Newswire and has a market capitalization of 1.48 billion pounds ($2.4 billion), is in the final stages of negotiating a deal and could announce the transaction as early as this week, one of the people said. Discussions are continuing and could still fall apart, the people cautioned, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. UBM has so far prevailed over other bidders for the asset, including U.S. information services company Penton, the people said.
