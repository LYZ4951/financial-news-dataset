LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Support for independence in Scotland has risen three percentage points to 48 percent, an ICM poll for the Scotsman newspaper showed on Tuesday, two days before a referendum on whether Scotland should split from the United Kingdom.

The poll showed support among Scottish voters for staying in the United Kingdom at 52 percent, falling from 55 percent in a similar poll last month.
