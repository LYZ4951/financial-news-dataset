MOSCOW, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Western sanctions on Russian companies, officials and banks are counterproductive and do not solve political problems, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said on Tuesday.

"When it comes to sanctions we consider them meaningless, counterproductive ... measures that do not solve political problems," he told a foreign business conference.
