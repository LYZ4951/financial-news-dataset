WARSAW, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Polish regulator KNF has extended until mid-2016 the deadline for Italian holding company Carlo Tassara group to sell its stake in Poland's mid-tier lender Alior Bank <ALRR>, the bank said late on Monday.

Carlo Tassara, the struggling holding company for French financier Romain Zaleski, controls 26 percent of Alior. The bank has a market value of $1.83 billion. Tassara has been seeking to sell its stake in Alior for years, but has struggled to find a buyer because of the bank's relatively high valuation. The regulator had given the group until the end of this year to find a buyer.  Analysts say Alior's high valuation is driven by investor speculation that any potential buyer would be willing to pay a premium to take control over the fast growing, innovative bank.
