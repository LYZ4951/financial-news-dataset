DUBAI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Savola Group <2050.SE> has appointed JP Morgan <JPM.N> to advise on its potential purchase of a stake in Kuwait Food Co <FOOD.KW> (Americana), the Jeddah-based firm said on Tuesday.

Savola previously said in August it had held preliminary talks with one of Americana's largest shareholders about buying a stake in the rival food producer. At the time, Savola did not name the shareholder, but Kuwait's al-Kharafi family owns 67 percent of Americana, according to Reuters data. [ID:nL5N0QP12Z]
