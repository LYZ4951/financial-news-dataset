BELGRADE, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Tsvetan Vassilev, the majority owner of Bulgaria's troubled Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank), surrendered on Tuesday to police in Serbia on an international warrant for embezzlement, a senior interior ministry source said.

Corpbank <6C9.BB> has been in limbo since June, when a run on deposits prompted Bulgaria's central bank to seize control of it and close its operations, triggering the worst banking crisis in the poor Black Sea state since the 1990s.
