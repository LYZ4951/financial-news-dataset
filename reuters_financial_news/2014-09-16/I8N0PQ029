MUMBAI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell over 1 percent on Tuesday, posting their biggest single-day decline in 1-1/2 months as blue-chips slipped on caution ahead of the U.S. federal Reserve's two-day meeting, while foreign portfolio sales also weighed on sentiment.

Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> provisionally fell 2.4 percent, while Axis Bank <AXBK.NS> ended 3.3 percent down.
