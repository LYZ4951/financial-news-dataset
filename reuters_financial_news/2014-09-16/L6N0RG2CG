STOCKHOLM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Swedish home prices rose by 2.7 percent in August from July and were up by 10.9 percent from a year earlier, the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) showed on Tuesday.

Prices for apartments increased 1.3 percent compared to the previous month and were up 13.7 percent compared to the same month last year. Single-family house prices rose 3.5 percent on the month, and were up 9.4 percent on the year. The HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends. A boom in Swedish home prices since the late 1990s has driven up household debt to some of the highest levels in Europe, raising concerns among policy makers.
