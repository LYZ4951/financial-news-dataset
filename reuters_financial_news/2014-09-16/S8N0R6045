HONG KONG, Sept 16 (Reuters) - China shares had their worst day in more than six months on Tuesday, as investors continued to fret about weak economic data and started to worry about liquidity as a new batch of initial public offerings loomed.

Foreign direct investment in China in August fell to a low not seen in at least 2-1/2 years, the Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday, underscoring the growth challenges facing the world's second-biggest economy. [ID:nL3N0RH19G] The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 1.8 percent to 2,297.00 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings shed 2.0 percent to a two-week low. Tuesday brought the biggest percentage-drops for both indexes since March 10. Recent outperformers were among Tuesday's largest drags. SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS>, which last week hit its highest since February 2013, sank 4.6 percent. China Shipbuilding Industry <601989.SS> dived 5.3 percent from this year's closing high.
