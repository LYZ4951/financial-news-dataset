LAGOS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Nigerian southeastern state of Ebonyi is planning to raise 9.34 billion naira ($57.32 million) in bonds to refinance its bank debt and complete some development projects.

Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that the state had applied for its approval to offset existing bank loans from United Bank for Africa (UBA) <UBA.LG> and fund the building of a market and a government office building.
