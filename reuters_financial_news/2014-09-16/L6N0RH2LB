STOCKHOLM, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Sweden's finance markets minister Peter Norman said on Tuesday he would leave politics after the four-party Alliance government lost in a general election at the weekend to the centre-left.

"I'm longing for a real job," Norman said to business daily Dagens Industri. Norman's departure is the third in three days from the Moderate Party, the biggest party in the centre-right Alliance.
