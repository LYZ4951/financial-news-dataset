Sept 16 (Reuters) - South Africa will price its maiden sukuk as early as this week, with books likely to close on Wednesday, after settling on a 5.75 year term for the dollar-denominated Islamic bond, a lead manager said.

The bond, which has been in the works since 2011 and follows debut sukuk issues from Hong Kong and the United Kingdom earlier this year, could raise $500 million or more. [ID:nL5N0RC01S] Rated at Baa1 by Moody's South Africa will test appetite among Islamic investors for riskier investment-grade debt.  "We expect to close the books, subject to market conditions, on Wednesday London afternoon," said a lead manager, adding that initial pricing for the deal would be released on Tuesday. The Treasury has said issuing sukuk will help diversify its funding sources, and with a June 2020 maturity the deal would be in line with its strategy of reducing refinancing risk. After South Africa issued a $1 billion 30-year bond and a 500 million euro 12-year bond in July, the sukuk is likely to form part of its pre-funding for the next financial year. A sovereign sukuk could pave the way for local issuers to follow. In May, Bahrain-based Al Baraka Banking Group <BARKA.BH> said it was considering issuing subordinated sukuk through its South African unit to boost regulatory capital. [ID:nL6N0O51OM] Sukuk transactions in Africa have been few and infrequent, but governments see an opportunity to tap cash-rich Islamic investors from the Gulf and southeast Asia.  Gambia has issued short term sukuk for domestic needs, while Senegal raised 100 billion CFA francs ($208 million) via its first sukuk in June. South Africa's sukuk will be listed in Luxembourg and use an ijara structure, a sharia-compliant sale-and-leaseback contract favoured by sovereigns, with proceeds used to buy interest in a portfolio of properties to be held by a special purpose vehicle.
