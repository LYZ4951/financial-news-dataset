HONG KONG, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index fell for an eighth session in a row on Tuesday, hurt by a tumble in mainland markets and continued weakness in Macau casinos.

China's two major share indexes posted their biggest daily loss in more than six months on Tuesday, after a slew of weak economic data generated fresh growth worries.  The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> finished a typhoon-shortened session off 0.9 percent at 24,136.01 points, the lowest close since July 23.  The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong lost 1.1 percent,  taking it also to an 8-week closing low. Trading began in the afternoon after Typhoon Kalmaegi forced cancellation of Hong Kong's morning session.  Index heavyweights China Mobile <0941.HK> sank 3.8 percent and Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> 1.9 percent.
