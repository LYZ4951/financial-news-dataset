DUBAI, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> will complete a $500 million debut sukuk issue later on Tuesday, with price guidance tightened slightly from earlier indications due to strong demand from investors, a document from lead managers showed on Tuesday.

The latest price guidance for the five-year transaction was revised to a range of between 90 and 95 basis points over midswaps, the document showed, having been marked earlier in the day in the area of 95 bps over the same benchmark. [ID:nL6N0RF0FX] The offer, expected to be rated A-minus by Standard & Poor's and A by Fitch Ratings, has garnered orders worth $1.4 billion from investors. Books will close at 1000 GMT, the document added. The sukuk is being issued through a vehicle called JANY Sukuk Co and will be guaranteed by Goldman Sachs.
