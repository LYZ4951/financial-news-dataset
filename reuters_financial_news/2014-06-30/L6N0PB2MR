LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - France and China have launched a midcap private equity fund to boost investment and exposure between the two following a visit by the Chinese president to France earlier this year.

The Sino French midcap fund has reached a first close of 460 million euros ($627.5 million), its backers Bpifrance, China Development Bank (CDB) Capital and Cathay Capital said on Monday, in line with its target final close of 500 million euros.  Bpifrance, a part state-owned French fund, and CDB Capital agreed to be cornerstone investors in the fund in March this year. It will be managed by Chinese-French private equity house Cathay Capital. The companies launched a similar 150 million-euro fund focused on SMEs in 2012.  "Chinese companies will be able to benefit from advanced technological expertise which is well-developed in France, while, in turn, French companies will gain from increased exposure to the booming Chinese consumption market," said Haibin Fan, president of China Development Bank.
