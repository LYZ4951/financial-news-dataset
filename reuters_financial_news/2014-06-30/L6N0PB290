DUBAI, June 30 (Reuters) - Al Hamra Real Estate Development, based in the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, has obtained an 850 million dirham ($230 million) financing facility from international and local banks led by Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, the developer said on Monday.

The privately owned firm said the seven-year facility would be used to refinance existing debt and to finance planned new real estate projects. It did not reveal the terms of the facility. Long a relative backwater in the economy of the seven-member United Arab Emirates, northern emirates such as Ras Al Khaimah are now growing rapidly as wealth spreads from Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
