June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Precise Mortgage Funding  2014-1 plc's notes expected ratings, as follows:   Class A: 'AAA(EXP)sf', Outlook Stable Class B: 'AA(EXP)sf', Outlook Stable Class C: 'A(EXP)sf', Outlook Stable Class D: 'BBB(EXP)sf', Outlook Stable Class Z: not rated The final ratings are subject to the receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received. Credit enhancement for the class A notes at 15.0% will be provided by the  subordination of the class B to class Z notes. The transaction is an RMBS securitisation of near-prime residential mortgages  that were originated by Charter Court Financial Services (CCFS), trading as  Precise Mortgages (Precise or the originator) in the UK (excluding Northern  Ireland). The loans are serviced by Charter Court Financial Services Limited  (Exact).   KEY RATING DRIVERS Post-Crisis, Near-Prime Mortgages The loans in the portfolio are post-crisis originations that have been  underwritten using near-prime criteria. Borrowers can be accepted with minor  levels of prior adverse credit history, but the levels of prior adverse in the  pool are small in comparison with the levels seen during the peak of the cycle  in 2006/2007.  Limited Performance History, Stringent Underwriting Precise began originating loans in 2010 and as such can only provide fairly  limited loan performance data. The data covers 44 months, but there is only 12  months of history where the sample is greater than 1,000 loans. However, Fitch  believes that this is adequately offset by the stringent underwriting criteria  and controls in place. Given this, and that the non-prime default matrix was  used, the agency applied a minor 10% downward adjustment to the base default  probabilities.  Unrated Orignator and Seller The originator and seller are not rated entities and may have limited resources  available to repurchase any mortgages in the event of a breach of  representations and warranties (RW) given to the issuer. Whilst Fitch considers  this a weakness, there are a number of mitigating factors that make the  likelihood of a RW breach remote.  Hedged Fixed/Floating Risk As at 20 June 2014 the portfolio was around 61.5% fixed rate loans, with the  rated notes paying three-month Libor plus a margin. A balance-guaranteed swap is  in place, where the issuer pays fixed and receives three-month GBP Libor.  Combined Liquidity, General Reserve The transaction is supported by a non-amortising rated note reserve fund set at  3.0% of the rated note balances at closing. The reserve fund is initially  isolated to provide only liquidity support at the point of closing, covering  primarily class A liquidity shortfalls and liquidity shortfalls to the other  rated notes. As the senior notes amortise, the liquidity portions reduce and the  remainder becomes available to absorb credit losses. As the reserve fund is not  available to absorb credit losses at the time of closing, the agency has not  included it in credit enhancement calculations.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Material increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted  receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case  expectations, which in turn may result in potential negative rating actions on  the notes. Fitch's analysis revealed that a 30% increase in the weighted average  (WA) foreclosure frequency, along with a 30% decrease in the WA recovery rate,  would result in a model-implied downgrade of the class A notes to 'Asf' from  'AAAsf' and a model-implied downgrade of the class B notes to 'BBB+sf' from  'AAsf'.  More detailed model implied ratings sensitivity can be found in the presale  report which is available at www.fitchratings.com.  Precise provided Fitch with a loan-by-loan data template. All relevant fields  were provided in the data tape, with the exception of prior mortgage arrears,  where Precise was unable to differentiate between loans having had one to six  months of prior arrears and those having had seven to 12 months prior arrears.  Performance data on historical static arrears was provided for all loans  originated by Precise, but the scope of the data was limited by the small  origination volumes (around GBP725m of owner-occupied, buy-to-let and short-term  mortgage loans) and the length of available history (the first Precise  origination was in early 2010). Due to Precise's limited origination history of Precise, it was only able to  provide loan-level data for a single sold repossession. However, Precise  provided a data tape in Fitch's template for 217 sold repossessions that have  been serviced by Exact, which included the Precise originated loans. Although  the majority of the sample was not for loans originated by Precise, the agency  considers the performance of the servicer to be one of the key components in  determining sold possession performance. Given this, the agency assumed an  average quick sale adjustment of 23%, which although conservative, did give some  credit for the performance of the servicer in selling possessed properties. The  market value decline assumptions were adjusted to reflect these assumptions. On a site visit to Precise's offices Fitch conducted a file review to check the  quality of Precise' originations on a larger number of loans that would be  reviewed during a review of an established prime lender. Fitch has also reviewed the results of an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) report  conducted on the portfolio, which checked the accuracy of the data file provided  to Fitch for its rating analysis. The AUP report showed there were no material  errors in the data sample that had been tested. It is Fitch's opinion that the data available for the rating analysis was of  sufficient quality. To analyse the CE levels, Fitch evaluated the collateral using its default model  ResiEMEA. The agency assessed the transaction cash flows using default and loss  severity assumptions under various structural stresses including prepayment  speeds and interest rate scenarios. The cash flow tests showed that each class  of notes could withstand loan losses at a level corresponding to the related  stress scenario without incurring any principal loss or interest shortfall and  can retire principal by the legal final maturity.
