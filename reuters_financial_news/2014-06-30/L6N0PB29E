LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Portuguese government bond yields rose on Monday after Luxembourg's justice authorities said they had begun an investigation into three holding companies of Portugal's largest listed bank.

Shares of Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> plunged on Monday. Finance Minister Maria Luis Albuquerque said the bank was well-capitalised and the government saw no threat to financial stability and public accounts.
