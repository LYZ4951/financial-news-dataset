ATHENS, June 30 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola HBC (CC HBC) <CCH.L> <EEEr.AT>, the world's No. 2 bottler of Coca-Cola Co <KO.N> drinks, plans to delist its shares held in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange next month, it said on Monday.

The bottler, which moved its tax base from Greece to Switzerland and its primary listing from Athens to London last year, said its ADR programme was not contributing much to facilitating trading in its securities, accounting for only about 1.3 percent of total volume in the past 12 months. "Since our premium listing on the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> on 29 April 2013, the United Kingdom has become the principal trading market for our shares", CC HBC said in a statement.
