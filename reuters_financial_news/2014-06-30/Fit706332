June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned PT Pakuwon  Jati Tbk's <PWON.JK> (Pakuwon, B+/Stable) USD168m 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2019 a  final 'B+' rating, with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. The new notes are issued by  Pakuwon Prima Pte Ltd and guaranteed by Pakuwon and certain subsidiaries.  The notes are rated at the same level as Pakuwon's senior unsecured debt rating  as they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated  obligations of the company. The rating action follows the receipt of documents  conforming to information already received. The final rating is in line with the  expected rating assigned on 19 June 2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS Support from Investment Property Portfolio:  Pakuwon is a diversified real  estate developer based in Indonesia. The company's property portfolio includes  retail, residential, commercial and hospitality developments. Its ratings  reflect its solid investment properties, which contributed 48% of total revenue  in 2013. Furthermore, 42% of the revenue was derived from its shopping mall and  office leasing operations which have a long-term lease profile.  These investment properties generated solid recurring EBITDA of IDR778bn  (USD67m) and recurring EBITDA/interest coverage of 3.8x, which along with the  company's strong liquidity position will help it manage any cyclicality and  volatility of property development.  Quality Assets: The company's investment portfolio is spread across four well  established and strategically located prime locations in Jakarta and Surabaya.  The main projects comprise of mixed use high rise developments (apartments,  office, retail, and sometimes hotel). Pakuwon's malls, while providing stable  recurring revenue, anchor each of its land banks in Jakarta and Surabaya,  thereby attracting residents and office tenants while servicing as focal points  for local communities. The company has a strong track record of managing its  lease retail occupancy, and consistently achieves above industry average  occupancy. Higher Margin than Peers:  Fitch expects Pakuwon to generate EBITDA margin above  50% in the medium term, supported by a low cost land bank and the company's  ability to create value in its superblocks. Pakuwon posted EBITDA margin of 56%  in 2013 (2012: 55.6%),  higher than other rated developers such as PT Alam  Sutera Realty Tbk <ASRI.JK> (B+/Stable) with 42% and PT Lippo Karawaci Tbk <LPKR.JK> (BB-/Stable) with 27%. Fitch believes that such a high margin will provide some pricing  flexibility during a downturn in the property cycle. Limited Scale and Diversification:  Pakuwon's rating is constrained by its  limited scale and project diversification. Fitch expects the company to generate  most of its cash flows from its current established super blocks in the medium  term. Based on the current rate of development, the company's land bank of 394  hectares would be sufficient for more than 10 years of development. Although the  company will launch a new residential project in West Surabaya in 2H2014, Fitch  notes that its projects and cash flows are less diversified than higher rated  peers.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating action is not anticipated in the medium-term given the company's  limited scale, projects, and cash flow diversification.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Sustained deterioration of recurring EBITDA from investment properties (IP)  /interest below 2.5x  - net debt/net inventory (net inventory defined as IP + Inventory + Property and  Equipment - Advances) rises above 50% on a sustained basis - weakening of business profile as evidenced by significant rise in vacancy  rates or a sustain fall in rentals
