TEL AVIV, June 30 (Reuters) - Tel Aviv's district attorney has indicted Israeli businessman Nochi Dankner and conglomerate IDB Holding Corp <IDBH.TA> for securities fraud, the Justice Ministry said on Monday.

Dankner and a securities trader are accused by the Israel Securities Authority of trying to artificially inflate IDB's share price to help ensure the success of a sale of shares and warrants in February 2012. Dankner was IDB's controlling shareholder at the time. The charges against Dankner carry a possible prison sentence. He has denied any wrongdoing.  One of Israel's largest holding companies, IDB and its various units hold stakes in Cellcom <CEL.TA>, Israel's largest mobile phone operator, Super-Sol <SAE.TA>, the country's biggest supermarket chain, and real estate developer Property & Building <PTBL.TA>.  Dankner lost control of IDB when Argentinian businessman Eduardo Elsztain and his Israeli partner Moti Ben-Moshe group won support from 75 percent of bondholders and bank creditors for a takeover as part of a debt restructuring.
