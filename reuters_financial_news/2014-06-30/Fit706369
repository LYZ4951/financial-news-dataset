June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to assign telecom infrastructure  group Helios Towers Nigeria Limited (HTN) a Long-term Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) of 'B(EXP)' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also assigned expected  ratings of 'B(EXP)'/'RR4' to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by  Helios Towers Finance Netherlands B.V..   A full list of the rating actions can be found below. HTN plans to issue USD225m of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2019 through a  fully owned Dutch finance subsidiary, Helios Towers Finance Netherlands B.V..  The notes will be guaranteed by HTN and Tower Infrastructure Company Limited, a  fully owned subsidiary of HTN, which owns part of the group's tower  infrastructure assets. The notes are rated at the same level as the company's IDR of 'B(EXP)' as they  constitute a direct, unconditional and unsecured obligation of HTN and the other  guarantor, and rank pari passu with all existing and future unsecured  obligations of HTN. The bond documentation includes cross-default and change of  control provisions as well as incurrence tests limiting additional indebtedness  and restricted payments. The expected IDR assumes the successful issue of the proposed notes and full  repayment of HTN's existing debt. Final ratings are contingent upon receipt of  final documents conforming materially to the preliminary documentation that  Fitch has received. HTN is the second-largest independent tower company in Nigeria (based on the  number of towers) with 1,187 towers at end-2013. The company leases space to  telecoms operators at its tower sites for antennas and other wireless  transmission equipment and provides full site maintenance, including power  management and security services, under long-term lease agreements.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Growth Potential The Nigerian economy is seeing rapidly increasing demand for mobile and  broadband communication services. Given a distinct lack of fixed-line  infrastructure, poor mobile coverage and regulatory pressure to improve quality  of service, mobile operators are expected to continue investing in voice and  data capacity and deploy more base stations to benefit from this growth  potential. Operators are also looking to free up capital to invest in their  networks by divesting their tower assets, following a wider shift in Africa  towards co-location and leasing towers from independent tower operators. HTN  should be able to capitalise on these trends, mainly by adding more tenants to  its portfolio of live and dormant towers, as it has successfully done over the  past few years. This should help HTN realise significant economies of scale and  improve its free cash-flow generation and leverage profile.  Revenue Visibility HTN benefits from a visible revenue stream driven by long-term lease agreements,  which comprise embedded contractual escalators and, in some cases, cost  pass-through mechanisms. Following the shift in the market from CDMA to GSM  operators, over 75% of revenues are derived from three major Tier 1 GSM players,  MTN, Etisalat, and Airtel, which are all backed by investment-grade parents. As  at 31 December 2013, the average remaining life of all tenancy agreements was  4.8 years, and HTN had total contracted revenues of USD352m.  Changes to Competitive Environment HTN has a strong market position protected by high barriers to entry, switching  costs, and quality of service. However, the intent of GSM operators to sell  their towers represents both an opportunity and a threat. HTN will likely be  compelled to compete against other independent tower companies for any potential  deal. A successful bid by HTN or its affiliated companies could consolidate  HTN's strong position in the Nigerian towers market.  However, these potential transactions could result in the introduction of  another independent tower operator, which could change competitive dynamics over  the medium-term. An additional threat is potential further consolidation among  operators as this may lead to lower demand for base stations and co-location  requirements.  HTN's Size and Evolution HTN is a small but rapidly growing company. A successful bond issue to refinance  HTN's existing debt and the setting up of a new revolving credit facility would  improve the company's maturity profile and liquidity, and form a solid  foundation for future growth. Free cash-flow generation is presently weak and  leverage is high, but if the business can successfully activate its portfolio of  dormant towers, continue to grow its tenant base and increase the number of  co-locations per tower, then HTN will realise the economies of scale inherent in  its tower business model and move strongly into positive FCF territory. This  should lead to strong deleveraging.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive  rating action include: -FFO adjusted net leverage below 4.0x on a sustainable basis (FYE13: 6.2x) -FFO fixed charge cover of greater than 2.5x (FYE13: 1.3x) -Significant and sustainable improvement in FCF generation -Sustained strong market position in the Nigerian towers industry as the market  develops  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative  rating action include: -Failure to reduce FFO adjusted net leverage, on a sustainable basis, to 5.0x -FFO fixed charge cover less than 2.0x on a sustainable basis -Continued weak FCF due to limited EBITDA growth, higher capex and shareholder  distributions, or adverse changes to HTN's regulatory or competitive environment  Full List of Rating Actions: Helios Towers Nigeria Limited Long-term Foreign Currency IDR: 'B(EXP)'/Outlook Stable  Senior unsecured rating: 'B(EXP)'/'RR4' National Long-term rating: 'A-(EXP)(nga)'/Outlook XX  Helios Towers Finance Netherlands B.V.
