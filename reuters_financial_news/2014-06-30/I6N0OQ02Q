MILAN, June 30 (Reuters) - Italian businessman Andrea Bonomi said on Monday he expected his counter-bid for Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> to win approval from France's AMF in two weeks time and then be completed by early September.

"The offering should be concluded at the end of August or in the first days of September," he said on Monday in a conference call with journalists.
