June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed four Vietnamese banks' Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'B'. The Outlook is Positive for Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development [VBARD.UL] (Agribank) and Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade <CTG.HM> (Vietinbank). Fitch has also withdrawn the Viability Rating (VR) on Agribank. The Outlook for Asia Commercial Bank <ACB.HN> (Vietnam) (ACB) has been revised to Stable  from Negative. The Outlook is Stable for Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint  Stock Bank <STB.HM> (Sacombank). The ratings of Sacombank are simultaneously withdrawn as  they are no longer considered relevant to the agency's rating coverage. Fitch  will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for the company following  the withdrawal. A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this  rating action commentary.   KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, Senior Debt, Support Ratings (SRs) and Support Rating  Floors (SRFs) of Agribank and Vietinbank The Long-Term IDRs of the two state-owned banks, Agribank and Vietinbank, are  driven by state support. Their SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation of  likely extraordinary state support as both banks are majority owned by the  government and among those most systemically important to the domestic economy.  Nonetheless, timeliness of extraordinary support from the government may be  limited by its own finances as reflected in the 'B+' sovereign rating. As a  result, the banks' ratings are one notch lower than the sovereign rating. Vietinbank's senior notes are rated at the same level as its Long-Term IDR,  given that the notes constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured  obligations of the bank, and rank equally with all its other unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations. The Recovery Rating on the notes is affirmed at  'RR4'. Fitch assigns Recovery Ratings to issues from entities with IDR of 'B+'  or below. The Positive Outlooks on Agribank and Vietinbank reflect the Positive Outlook on  Vietnam's sovereign ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VRs of Agribank and Vietinbank  Agribank's VR of 'ccc' reflects Fitch's view that the bank's buffers may not be  sufficient to absorb loan losses considering its very weak loan quality, thin  net profitability and weak capitalisation. The bank's capitalisation will be  even weaker if it is adjusted for 'true' asset quality or prudent level of  provision according to the international standards. Simultaneously, Agribank's VR has been withdrawn given that the bank has a  government policy function in the agriculture industry and insufficient  information was provided, which implies that the bank's transparency has  worsened. In addition, Agribank, unlike other state-owned banks, is unlikely in  the near to medium term to sell a stake to private (usually foreign) investors,  a process known as equitisation in Vietnam.  Vietinbank's VR reflects its weak credit matrix, including continued weakness in  its true loan quality, a loan book that is concentrated in SOEs and declining  profitability. Meanwhile, its improved capitalisation thanks to equitisation may  support its loss-absorption buffer to some extent. Fitch does not expect the  financial profile of Vietnamese banks to improve in the near term, given that  the government's restructuring of the banking and SOE sector is still in  progress and any improvements would take a while to be reflected in the banks'  performances.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VRs, SRs and SRFs of ACB and Sacombank The Long-Term IDRs of ACB and Sacombank are driven by their VRs. The ratings  reflect their reasonable standalone credit profiles and risk exposures,  including loans to state-owned entities. However, they are constrained by the  negative banking industry outlook due to the lingering loan quality risks and  declining profitability. Sacombank's ratings do not take into account its plan  to acquire Southern Bank, given that the transaction has not been confirmed.  ACB's Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative, reflecting Fitch's view  that downward pressures on the bank's financial profile have reduced, including  significant impairment risks arising from the bank's exposure to companies  related to one of ACB's shareholders, Mr. Nguyen Duc Kien. The bank has made  efforts and will continue to resolve these problems. Profits increased slightly  in 2013 as the bank consolidated its balance sheet and streamlined operations to  cut costs. Deposits grew by 10% from a year ago. ACB has also been disciplined  in maintaining a liquid balance sheet with loans/deposits ratio of 78%. The '5' SRs and 'No Floor' SRFs of ACB and Sacombank reflect Fitch's view that  state support may be possible but cannot be relied upon.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, SRs and SRFs of Agribank, Vietinbank, ACB and  Sacombank The SRs and SRFs are sensitive to shifts in the sovereign's creditworthiness and  ratings, which at present have a Positive Outlook. These ratings may be hurt by any perceived weakening in the government's  propensity to support the banks, although such prospect is remote for the  systemically important state-owned banks, including Agribank and Vietinbank. In  contrast, ACB's SR and SRF are already at the lowest end of the ratings scale.  Rating sensitivities for Sacombank are no longer relevant given the rating has  been withdrawn.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VRs of Agribank, Vietinbank, ACB and Sacombank Vietnamese banks' VRs might be pressured if asset quality risks become bigger  threats to banks' capitalisation than the current ratings factor in. Negative  rating action may also result from increasing risk appetite, which may be  demonstrated in excessive asset growth, or event risks such as M&A or  operational lapses that could affect the banks' credit profile.  VRs may be upgraded if the restructuring process in the banking industry  (including increased transparency and bad debt resolution) and SOE sector along  with sustainable asset quality improvement bring noticeable improvements in  banks' financial performance. However, such improvements are unlikely in the  near term.  Rating sensitivities for Agribank and Sacombank are no longer relevant given  their ratings have been withdrawn.
