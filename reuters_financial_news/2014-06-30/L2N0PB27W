June 30 (Reuters) - Two Maryland kayakers were recovering on Monday from injuries sustained after falling 200 feet down a Baltimore County dam, according to Baltimore County police.

The two men were rescued in a two-hour operation late on Sunday after apparently going over the rim of the Prettyboy Dam, police said. Damaged kayaks were found at the base of the dam.
