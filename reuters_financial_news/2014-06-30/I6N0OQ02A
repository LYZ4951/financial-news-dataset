MILAN, June 30 (Reuters) - Trading of shares in Italy's Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> were suspended after they fell more than 4 percent on Monday, with traders saying the lender's decision to cancel the sale of its bad bank unit, Release, was weighing on the stock.

"The failure to sell the (bad bank unit) Release is negative news for Banco Popolare as it will slow down the process to reduce the risky assets held by the bank," a Milan-based broker said. In an interview on Sunday, Banco Popolare's Chief Executive Pier Francesco Saviotti confirmed the bank had shelved plans to sell its bad debt unit as bids received were considered too low.
