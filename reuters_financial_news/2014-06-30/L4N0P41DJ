June 30 (Reuters) - Assets at the Exchange Fund, which is used to back the Hong Kong dollar, totalled HK$3,020.2 billion ($389.68 billion) at the end of May, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said on Monday.

The figure was HK$29.8 billion lower than the total at the end of April, with foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets falling HK$15.3 billion and HK$14.5 billion respectively, the city's de facto central bank said in a statement. The HKMA said the decline in foreign currency assets was mainly due to a fall in unsettled purchases of securities, which was partly offset by the purchase of foreign currencies with Hong Kong dollars and valuation gains on foreign currency investments.
