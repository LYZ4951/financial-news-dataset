June 30 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager John Paulson's credit opportunities and merger arbitrage funds were up 6.6 percent and 3.3 percent year-to-date through the end of May, respectively, easily surpassing their benchmarks, according to an investor in attendance at Paulson & Co's recent mid-year client event.

Paulson, who runs more than $21 billion and made headlines last week on news he amassed a large stake in Allergan Inc <AGN.N> of more than six million shares and supports a deal between the Botox maker and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc <VRX.TO>, told clients at the recent London event that merger arbitrage spreads are "becoming attractive," noting Allergan and Mallinkckrodt's acquisition of Questcor Pharma.
