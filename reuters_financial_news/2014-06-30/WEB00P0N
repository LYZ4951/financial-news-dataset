FRANKFURT, June 30 (Reuters) - HeidelbergCement's <HEIG.DE> is in the process of hiring Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> and BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> to assist with the planned divestment of its British and U.S. building products businesses, two people familiar with the situation said on Monday.

The divestment would likely be a sale, although the option of a stock market flotation was also being considered, the sources said.
