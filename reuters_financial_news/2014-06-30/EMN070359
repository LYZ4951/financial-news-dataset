OSLO, June 30 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank will not sell Norwegian crowns in July to buy foreign exchange for the country's sovereign wealth fund, the bank said on Monday on its <NOCC> page, in line with its practice in recent months.

The bank earlier said it did not expect to buy any foreign currency over the coming months and it could even buy crowns later in the year.
