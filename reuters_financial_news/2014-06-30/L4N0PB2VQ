June 30 (Reuters) - Banks will next week return 4.3 billion euros ($5.9 billion) of the more than one trillion euro long-term loans they took from the European Central Bank, slightly less than this week's repayment, a Reuters poll showed.

On average, banks repaid 8 billion euros each week in June, nearly twice the amount they did in May. With 4.5 billion euros to be returned on Wednesday, the outstanding crisis loan amount will fall to 408.8 billion euros.

"This has happened recently, so repayments could diminish over the coming weeks.  "The asset quality review weighed on banks at the end of last year, but not at the moment," the trader added. The ECB has begun an asset quality review of over 100 banks, testing them on how they will perform when faced with different shocks.  The poll of 24 euro zone money market traders showed banks will bid for 100 billion euros at the ECB's weekly tender, compared with the 115 billion euros maturing from last time. ----------------------------------------------------------------   ALLOTMENT ONE-WEEK ---------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN100.0  MEAN  102.7 MODE  100.0  HIGHEST   125.0LOWEST 90.0 COUNT   24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   THREE-YEAR LTRO REPAYMENTS   FIRST LTRO  SECOND LTRO   ----------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN 1.8   2.5MEAN   1.7   2.6MODE   1.0   2.0HIGHEST5.0   5.0LOWEST 0.0   1.0COUNT   2222   ----------------------------------------------------------------  GUIDE TO EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCEMENTS <ECBMENU> ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ECB OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS <ECB15> ECB WEBSITE www.ecb.int
