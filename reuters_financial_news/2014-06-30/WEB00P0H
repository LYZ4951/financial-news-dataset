PARIS, June 30 (Reuters) - Club Mediterranee's <CMIP.PA> top shareholder, Andrea Bonomi, offered to buy the French holiday company in a deal valuing it at 790 million euros ($1.1 billion) that trumps a bid by French private equity firm Ardian and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International <0656.HK>.

Investindustrial, the private equity fund led by the Italian tycoon, said it was bidding 21 euros per share for the 64-year-old all-inclusive holiday pioneer, higher than the 17.50 euros offered by the Franco-Chinese alliance.
