June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into the UK energy sector will push up costs for utilities and could lead to further asset sales, Fitch Ratings says. More dramatic reforms, including enforced break-up of utilities, are less likely, but cannot be ruled out. The additional costs could include further investments for the implementation of  better systems and customer engagement, and, at the other end of the scale,  higher costs of funding for credit support if utilities were forced to separate  their retail and generation businesses. However, previous enquires into energy  markets have not led to major structural reforms and we therefore consider  dramatic changes less likely. We also believe the investigation could lead to further UK asset disposals.  Centrica recently announced the disposal of three gas plants, representing more  than half its total generating capacity, due to unprofitability. A detailed  investigation into the profit generation of integrated utilities could therefore  lead energy providers to sell assets or halt future investments to focus on  assets in more profitable regions. Overall, the announcement heightens regulatory and political risks and weakens  the sector outlook. It is an additional challenge for the big six UK energy  companies - SSE <SSE.L>, Centrica <CNA.L>, RWE <RWEG.DE>, Electricite de France <EDF.PA>, E.ON <EONGn.DE> and Iberdrola <IBE.MC>/Scottish Power [IBESP.UL] - whose credit profiles are already under pressure. The main challenges include unprofitable thermal projects, asset write-downs,  increasing customer attrition and government support for businesses to cut  demand rather than introducing capacity support payments to the generators  before 2018. The investigation should lead to greater transparency regarding how utilities  generate their profits, creating the risk of tougher, more focused regulation.  We also expect the size of fines to increase and efficiency targets to become  tougher. However, it is unclear whether the outcome will be enough to restore  customer confidence in the sector. Even if confidence is restored this would  take some time, while in the short term political risk will remain high as  affordable energy will remain on the agenda of politicians ahead of upcoming  elections.
