June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Singaporean banks are well-positioned to meet new MAS  liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements, says Fitch Ratings.  The new rules, announced on 24 June, are in line with wider Basel III  objectives, and will require locally incorporated banks to maintain a full  (100%) local-currency LCR from January 2015. An all-currency LCR will also be  implemented, starting at 60% in 2015 and rising in annual 10pp steps to 100% by  2019. Foreign banks that are deemed systemically important to the domestic  banking system will also fall under the new framework, with LCR requirements of  100% and 50% for Singapore dollar and foreign-currency liabilities, respectively  beginning January 2016. The changes are in line with Basel III objectives, and reinforce the MAS's  conservative regulatory track record - a factor we have cited as contributing to  the stable outlook on the banking sector. Nonetheless, Singaporean banks have  become increasingly regionalised, and are expected to continue expanding their  overseas businesses. As such, the action by the MAS to ensure higher levels of  liquidity coverage, especially for non-Singapore dollar-denominated liabilities,  will help to curb potential sector imbalances. The MAS also announced plans to reinforce its regulatory framework for foreign  banks operating in Singapore. New proposed rules will require the retail  operations of foreign banks with at least a 3% market share of non-bank deposits  and at least 150,000 depositors with account balances of up to SGD250,000, to be  designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). This will likely  capture a large majority of the domestic Singapore banking system. D-SIBS will  be required to incorporate locally and maintain an additional 2pp of common  equity Tier 1 capital above international minimums (in addition to the new LCR  requirements), which is the same as that required for the three local banks.
