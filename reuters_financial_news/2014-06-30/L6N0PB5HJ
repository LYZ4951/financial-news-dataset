TIRANA, June 30 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund approved the second tranche of a 334.4 million-euro ($456.14 million) loan to Albania on Monday after the Balkan state met all its targets for the end of March, said an IMF statement from Washington.

Albania can now withdraw a second tranche of about 26.7 million euros, bringing the total made available to Albania under the arrangement to 53.3 million euros, the IMF said. The approval came a few days after the European Union gave Albania candidate status, setting it on the long road to membership five years after it applied.
