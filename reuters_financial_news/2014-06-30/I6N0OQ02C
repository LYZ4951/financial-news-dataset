MILAN, June 30 (Reuters) - UniCredit's <CRDI.MI> asset management unit Pioneer is a strategic asset for the bank and there are no plans to sell it, the Italian lender's deputy general manager said on Monday.

"There is market speculation and we acknowledge that, but we reaffirm the importance of Pioneer for the group, there is nothing concrete (on the table)," Paolo Fiorentino said on the sidelines of a conference. He said the bank was not planning to sell even a minority stake. A recent report by Sky News said CVC Capital Partners Ltd <CVC.N> was considering making an offer to buy as much as 50 percent of Pioneer Investments.
