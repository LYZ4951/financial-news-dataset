LISBON, June 30 (Reuters) - Portugal Telecom <PTC.LS> said on Monday 897 million euros in commercial paper issued by Rioforte, a holding company of the Espirito Santo banking family that has been under scrutiny recently, will mature next month and no new investment has been made.

PT shares have suffered since the company acknowledged last Thursday that it had bought the commercial paper from Rioforte. PT said it had subscribed the commercial paper at an average annual remuneration rate of 3.6 percent.  "All treasury applications in commercial paper of Rioforte will mature on 15 and 17 July 2014 - 847 million euros and 50 million euros, respectively," it said in a statement.
