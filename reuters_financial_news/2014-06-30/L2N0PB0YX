SAO PAULO, June 30 (Reuters) - Gazit-Globe <GZT.TA>, Israel's largest real estate investment company, plans to double its gross leasable area in Brazil over the next two to three years despite the economic headwinds facing Latin America's largest economy, the company's chairman said in an interview.

Gazit, which focuses on supermarket-anchored shopping centers, owns five properties in Brazil that make up just 1 percent of its roughly 6.6 million-square-meter global portfolio. The company is interested in purchasing an additional $300 million of properties in the city and state of Sao Paulo, founder and Chairman Chaim Katzman said. "Hopefully we will speed up the pace of acquisitions," Katzman said, brushing off concerns about the health of Brazil's economy, which is expected to grow just 1.1 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2015, according to a central bank survey. "If the currency or the economy deteriorates further we will buy more," he said late Friday. "Many investors are heading for the doors, but we try to have a long-term approach to the economy ... and things are getting better over time." Local retailers such as GPA SA <PCAR4.SA> are also starting to build small shopping centers anchored around their stores. For retailers in Brazil, real estate investments are an opportunity to support earnings as supermarket sales slow down due to higher inflation and weaker consumer confidence. Supermarket and hypermarket sales grew 3.3 percent over the 12 months through April, below the 4.9 percent for retail in general. In May, French retailer Carrefour SA <CARR.PA> announced real estate development projects at two of their metropolitan Sao Paulo locations.
