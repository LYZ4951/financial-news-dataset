June 30 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service said new pension accounting standards for U.S. state and local governments were likely to have limited credit impacts.

The new standards, Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 67 and 68, require pension plans and issuers to disclose the sensitivity of liabilities to a 100 basis point change in the discount rate.
