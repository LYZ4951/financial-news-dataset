SYDNEY, June 30 (Reuters) - Buyout firms TPG Capital and Carlyle Group [CG.O] are aiming to raise as much as A$2.57 billion ($2.42 billion) in an initial public offering of shares in Australia's Healthscope Ltd, making it the country's third-largest ever listing.

In a prospectus lodged on Monday, Healthscope said it would raise total proceeds under the offer from A$2.25 billion to A$2.57 billion, assuming the final price is within its indicative price range.
