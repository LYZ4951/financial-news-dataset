PRAGUE, June 30 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund raised its growth outlook for the Czech Republic on Monday and said the government should set a medium-term fiscal strategy that is growth-friendly.

The Czech economy, which is recovering from a record 18-month recession that ended a year ago, should grow by 2.5 percent in 2014, faster than the IMF's forecast of 1.9 percent seen in an April report, and in line with the central bank's outlook.
