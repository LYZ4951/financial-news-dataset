PARIS, June 30 (Reuters) - Club Med <CMIP.PA> shares were suspended at the request of the company ahead of the publication of a press release, stock market operator Euronext said on Monday.

Club Mediterranee's largest shareholder, Andrea Bonomi, has until 1600 GMT on Monday to say whether he plans to trump a bid by French private equity firm Ardian and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International <0656.HK> to buy the iconic French holiday resort operator.
