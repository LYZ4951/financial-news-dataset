FRANKFURT, June 30 (Reuters) - Private-sector deposits in Ireland saw their biggest monthly decline in three and a half years in May, European Central Bank data showed on Monday.

Private-sector deposits at Irish banks fell by 2.7 percent to 201.088 billion euros in May from the previous month, data showed. This marked the largest monthly decline since November 2010.  Deposits in Cyprus and other southern European countries hit by the euro zone debt crisis remained relatively stable, data showed. Big account holders in Cyprus's two largest lenders were forced to take a hit as part of an international bailout for Cyprus last year and private sector deposits at all banks on the island had been broadly declining since June 2012. In May, private-sector deposits at Cypriot banks fell by 0.1 percent to 34.303 billion euros from the previous month, data showed. The deposits are about 32 percent below their peak of 50.5 billion euros in May 2012. Banks in the euro zone member state were shut for nearly two weeks in March last year after Cyprus agreed a 10-billion-euro bailout under which major depositors had to pay part of the cost of the rescue. Capital controls are still in place, with limits on how much people can transfer from their accounts, although Cyprus is gradually easing the restrictions. In Italy, private-sector deposits fell by 0.3 percent in May after falling by 0.9 percent in the previous month. Deposits fell by 0.6 percent in Greece and rose by 0.1 percent in Portugal, the ECB data showed. Monthly fluctuations in the figures are common, though sharp consecutive drops in countries with stable banking systems are unusual.
