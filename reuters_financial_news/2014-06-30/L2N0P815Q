June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers recommended loading up on more American shares and bonds even as prices hit record highs in June, although they also increased cash allocations in their model global portfolio, a Reuters poll showed.

American fund managers' overall equity allocations nevertheless slipped to their lowest since March as holdings of euro zone stocks were cut to a nine-month low. The poll, published on Monday, suggests investors are still piling into U.S. assets based on the view that a dovish central bank will keep interest rates low for a very long time, and even though the global economic outlook remains shaky. The U.S. stock market has been in a bull market for the past five years and hasn't suffered even a 10 percent correction in the last two, while Wall Street's 'fear index', the CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX> hit a seven-year low earlier this month. U.S. Treasury yields plunged 50 basis points this year, taking many investors off guard.  After a dismal start to the year, the U.S. economy is expected to rebound on a self-sustaining growth path that should allow the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates in the second half of next year. [ECILT/US]  "The prevailing view is that good growth numbers in the U.S. will be good for stocks," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said this month that stock prices were not currently outside of historical norms, which emboldened many fund managers into thinking the stock market rally has further to go. But it will be only a matter of time before bond yields begin to rise, an outcome underscored by a separate Reuters poll of global fixed-income strategists published last week. [US/INT] The Reuters poll of 12 investment firms in the United States, taken June 12-29, showed their average global model portfolio held 67.5 percent of its stock allocations in U.S. and Canadian stocks, up 1 1/2 percentage points from a month before. Recommended allocations to both U.S. shares and bonds rose their highest in more than a year.  The S&P 500 index of leading shares <.SPX> has rallied about 1.5 percent this month, and nearly 6 percent this year. Gains have been broad, with more than 330 companies on the New York Stock Exchange hitting a 52-week high.  Cash holdings rose to 4.7 percent of portfolios, the highest level in just over a year, and more than double the amount held at the same time last year.
