LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - The dollar bond of Bulgaria's troubled Corporate Commercial Bank rallied by around 10 cents in the dollar on Monday after the European Commission sanctioned a credit line worth $2.3 billion for the country's banking sector.

The bond which matures Aug 8, fell almost 25 cents last week after a run on the bank, Bulgaria's fourth biggest, fuelled worries about repayment.  But market sources said the bond <XS0834163601=CCAP> was now trading around 83 cents in the dollar, up 10 cents from Friday's close on news of the European move and government assurances on the banking system. [ID:nL6N0PB14Z] The bond had been trading at par at the start of last week. Authorities have arrested four people suspected of trying to destabilise the banking system. [ID:nL6N0P51HQ] [ID:nL6N0PB195] "I suppose, the talk of the EU help and the arrests made over the weekend has helped sentiment," said one fund manager who asked not to be named.
