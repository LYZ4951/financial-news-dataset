BANGKOK, June 30 (Reuters) - Thai shares hit a nine-month high on Monday, heading for their best quarterly gain in more than a year as PTT <PTT.BK> extended its rally after the appointment of new directors, while quarter-end buying lifted large caps in Southeast Asia.

Shares of Thailand's top energy firm PTT were up 1.3 percent at midday after climbing 1.9 percent to an eight-month high of 318 baht, and adding to their strong gains from late last week. The stock was the most actively-traded on Monday. "The market is awaiting further development on the country's energy pricing reform while casting spotlight on a change in PTT's board of directors," strategists at broker Phillip Securities wrote in a daily report to clients. The SET index <.SETI> was up 0.3 percent at midday, having risen 8.1 percent so far in the April-June quarter amid strong buying interest from domestic investors as Thailand's military government tries to revive the domestic economy. The Bank of Thailand has forecast the economy will expand 5.5 percent in 2015, with 1.5 percent growth seen for 2014. The central bank is due to release May economic data later in the day.
