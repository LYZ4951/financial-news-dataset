June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Phoenix Park CLO Limited notes expected ratings, as follows:  EUR236.0m class A-1: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR47.0m class A-2: 'AA+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR24.0m class B: 'A(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR23.0m class C: 'BBB(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR24.0m class D: 'BB+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR14.0m class E: 'B-(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR45.25m subordinated notes: not rated  The assignment of the final ratings is contingent on the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already reviewed.  Phoenix Park CLO Limited is an arbitrage cash flow collateralised loan  obligation (CLO). Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used to  purchase a EUR400m portfolio of European leveraged loans and bonds. The  portfolio is managed by Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Management Europe Limited. The  transaction features a four-year reinvestment period.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Portfolio Credit Quality Fitch expects the average credit quality of obligors to be in the range of  'B'/'B-'. The agency has public ratings or credit opinions on 51 of 53 obligors  in the initial portfolio. The covenanted maximum Fitch weighted average rating  factor (WARF) for assigning the expected ratings is 34.0. The WARF of the  initial portfolio is 33.4. Above-average Recoveries The portfolio will comprise a minimum 90% senior secured obligations. Recovery  prospects for these assets are typically more favourable than for second-lien,  unsecured and mezzanine assets. Fitch has assigned recovery ratings to all  obligations in the initial portfolio. The covenanted minimum weighted average  recovery rate (WARR) for assigning the expected ratings is 70%. The WARR of the  initial portfolio is 72.5%. Payment Frequency Switch The notes pay quarterly while the portfolio assets can reset to a semi-annual  basis. The transaction has an interest-smoothing account, but no liquidity  facility. Liquidity stress for the non-deferrable class A-1 and A-2 notes,  stemming from a large proportion of assets resetting to a semi-annual basis in  any one quarterly period, is addressed by switching the payment frequency on the  notes to semi-annual in such a scenario, subject to certain conditions. Limited Interest Rate Risk No more than 10% of the portfolio may consist of fixed-rate assets;  consequently, the majority of this risk is naturally hedged, as all notes are  floating rate. Fitch modelled a 10% fixed-rate bucket in its analysis and the  rated notes can withstand the excess spread compression in a rising interest  rate environment.  Limited FX Risk Any non-euro-denominated assets have to be hedged with perfect asset swaps as of  the settlement date, limiting foreign exchange risk. The transaction is  permitted to invest up to 20% of the portfolio in non-euro-denominated assets. Participation Agreement The issuer will purchase the initial portfolio from Blackstone/GSO Corporate  Funding Limited (BGCF). At closing, the issuer will enter into a participation  agreement regarding the initial portfolio assets. Under the participation  agreement, BGCF will transfer the economic risk and benefits of the assets to  the issuer while retaining title to the assets. Immediately after closing BGCF  will begin transferring the title to the assets to the issuer via assignment.  The assignment process is expected to last several months.  This arrangement differs from other comparable Fitch-rated CLO transactions  since the seller of the initial portfolio is not a bankruptcy-remote warehouse  SPV. BGCF is an operating company whose business activities are not limited to  dealing with the issuer. BGCF will grant the issuer a fixed charge over the  initial portfolio assets while title is being transferred to the issuer. A fixed  charge over financial assets is generally debatable given the lack of control.  However Fitch received a strong legal opinion that the fixed charge in this case  is likely to be upheld. Fitch considers that the fixed charge coupled with the  relatively short risk horizon adequately mitigate the risk of the assets  becoming trapped in the insolvency estate of BGCF before the title transfer is  completed.  Documentation Amendments The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or noteholder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a rating action  commentary if the change has a negative impact on the ratings. Such amendments  may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis confirms the  expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity.  If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from a rating  perspective Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that the  structure considers the confirmation to be given if Fitch declines to comment.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
