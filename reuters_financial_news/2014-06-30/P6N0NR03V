PARIS, July 1 (Reuters) - The settlement reached between BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> and U.S. authorities over a sanctions busting case will preserve the future of the lender, the finance ministry said on Tuesday.

French Finance Minister Michel Sapin also said in a statement that the country's biggest listed bank "will still be able to finance economic activity (in France) in a satisfying way." He said the case showed Europe must work to promote the usage of the euro as an international exchange currency.
