CAIRO, June 30 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound was unchanged at a central bank dollar sale on Monday and weakened on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $39.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO>, the same as its last sale on Thursday. It had offered $40 million. The dollar was offered for 7.40 pounds on the black market on Monday, one trader said, slightly weaker than the 7.38 rate a day earlier.
