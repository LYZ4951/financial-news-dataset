June 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed six tranches of the Emerald  Series of Australian reverse mortgages. The transactions are securitisations of  Australian reverse mortgage receivables originated by Bluestone Equity Release  Pty Limited (Bluestone). The rating actions are listed below.  Emerald I Reverse Mortgage 2006-1 Trust: AUD85.0m Class A notes (ISIN AU300EMER013) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD13.1m Class B notes (ISIN AU300EMER021) affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD15.7m Class C notes (ISIN AU300EMER039) affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable  Emerald II Reverse Mortgage 2007-1 Trust: AUD98.2m Class A notes (ISIN AU3FN0003307) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD13.4m Class B notes (ISIN AU3FN0003315) affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD11.9m Class C notes (ISIN AU3FN0003323) affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable  The affirmations reflect Fitch's view that current credit enhancement levels  adequately support the notes' ratings, and that the performance of the portfolio  with regard to borrower exit rates, property values and interest rates, remains  in line with expectations.Given the nature of reverse mortgage asset classes, these transactions have the  unusual feature of an increasing liability balance. The increase is primarily  driven by the capitalisation of interest, further advances and periodic  instalments paid to the borrowers, which are funded by further advance and  committed advance facilities, respectively. It should be noted that the issue  balances reflect the amount payable to the note holders, as well as the  committed advance facility and further advance facility provider.  Emerald I Reverse Mortgage 2006-1 Trust: By the April 2014 payment date, the trust's reverse mortgage portfolio had  experienced 951 borrower exits, amounting to AUD103.5m. Exits typically come in  the form of borrower mortality, morbidity (move to long-term aged care), or  voluntary prepayments. The majority of exits from the pool to date have been due  to voluntary prepayments (660 exits), or loans repurchased by the Bluestone  Equity Release Series 1 Warehouse Trust (72 exits). Mortality and morbidity  account for 139 and 79 exits respectively. To date, the voluntary prepayment  rate for the pool, excluding repurchases by Bluestone, is 8.2% per annum. The  weighted average borrower age was 78.0 years, compared with 70.3 years at issue.  The WA LVR on the pool has increased to 36.9%, from 35.1% at closing. At the April 2014 payment date, the liability balance reached a total of  AUD113.8m from an initial balance of AUD112.2m. There were no un-reimbursed  drawings on the liquidity facility.  Emerald II Reverse Mortgage 2007-1 Trust: By the March 2014 payment date, the trust's reverse mortgage portfolio had  experienced 759 borrower exits totalling AUD92.9m. The majority of exits from  the pool to date have been due to voluntary prepayments (600 exits), or loans  repurchased by the Bluestone Equity Release Series 1 Warehouse Trust (7 exits),  while mortality and morbidity account for 120 and 32 exits respectively. To  date, the voluntary prepayment rate for the pool, excluding repurchases, is  13.1% per annum. The weighted average borrower age was 77.4 years, compared with  70.9 years at issue. The WA LVR on the pool has increased to 36.2%, from 32.4%  at closing. At March 2014, the liability balance had decreased to a total of AUD123.5m, from  an initial note balance of AUD124.2m. There were no un-reimbursed drawings  outstanding on the liquidity facility.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Property prices: The affirmations reflect the relative strength of the  Australian property market, which has not seen the significant devaluations  experienced in other advanced economies around the world. Australian property  prices have significantly increased since 2006/2007.Borrower exit rates: The combination of exits, which have generally occurred at  a faster rate than the original ratings' analysis anticipated, and  the steady  accumulation of excess spread has contributed to stronger levels of  overcollateralization.
