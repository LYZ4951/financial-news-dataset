STOCKHOLM, June 30 (Reuters) - Total lending to Swedish households rose 5.3 percent year-on-year in May, the statistics office said on Monday, continuing to gain on the previous months.

Household lending in April was up 5.2 percent from the previous year. Swedish policymakers have expressed concern about household borrowing levels that, at more than 170 percent of disposable income, are among the highest in Europe.
