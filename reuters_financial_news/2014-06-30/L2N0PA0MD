June 30 (Reuters) - Britain's Finance Minister George Osborne will unveil plans to merge income tax and national insurance, as a key element of the next Conservative manifesto, the Times reported, citing sources.

The paper said Downing Street was actively considering the plan. (http://thetim.es/1iKEkVs) Fears that merging of the two systems would lead to security concerns had caused Osborne to pull back from making an announcement in April, the paper said citing a source. "We came within a whisker of doing this at the last budget, but in the end we decided against it," the Times quoted a source as saying.  "They are currently on two separate computer systems and we thought the risk was just too great. But it's something we could do in the next parliament."
