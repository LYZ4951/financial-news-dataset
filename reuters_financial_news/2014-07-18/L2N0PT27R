SAO PAULO, July 18 (Reuters) - Demand for Brazilian structured notes among institutional investors should gain a boost once the uncertainty surrounding October's presidential election fades, a senior executive at Cetip SA Mercados Organizados <CTIP3.SA> said on Friday.

So far, 12 banks have sold the equivalent of 2.6 billion reais ($1.2 billion) worth of so-called COEs, as the instruments are known in Brazil, through private placements, Cetip data showed. Approval of a plan allowing the sale of COEs in public markets should fan sales of the instrument, said Carlos Ratto, senior vice president for Cetip's securities unit. Other regulatory steps that could facilitate the purchase of COEs by pension funds and other institutional investors could provide the incipient market an additional boost, Ratto said on a conference call. Cetip estimates that about 6 billion reais'  worth of COEs, which began to be marketed in January, could be sold this year.  Still, market swings caused by still-high risk aversion and political uncertainty have dampened demand for COEs as investors fled to low-risk investments like government notes. COEs provide  an alternative to banks that want to give clients, especially in private banking and wealth management, principal guaranteed-investment instruments that offer upside linked to a derivative. "Even as COEs offer investors flexible alternatives to bet on the rise or fall of an index or a security, in general the scenario has led potential buyers to concentrate their risk-taking on traditional fixed-income," Ratto said. "It's plausible to think that, once the noise eases, people will eye COEs as a viable alternative."  So far, COEs linked to Brazil's currency, the real <BRBY>, the consumer price index and equity indexes have been investors' favorite structures in the segment, Ratto said. Should pension funds enter the segment, COEs could be pegged to global equities and international stock indexes, he noted.  The benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> has gained 26 percent from March, when the index was close to a five-year low, on indications that President Dilma Rousseff was losing ground to market-friendly opponent Aécio Neves. Market volatility has increased as the election approaches, with currency prices and interest rate futures swinging violently in the wake of the latest political opinion polls.  For Cetip, Latin America's largest securities clearinghouse, COEs offer a significant source of future revenue. The São Paulo-based company registered more than 98 percent of COEs offered since the market began in January, Ratto said.
