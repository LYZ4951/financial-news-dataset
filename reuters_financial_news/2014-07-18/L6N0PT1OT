EDINBURGH, July 18 (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Friday, extending losses made late in the previous session after a passenger plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine, fuelling tensions between Russia and the West.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was down by 0.5 percent at 1,356.29 by 0705 GMT after ending Thursday 1 percent lower following a sell-off in late trade sparked by reports that the Malaysian airliner had crashed. Airline stocks such as Deutsche Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> and Ryanair <RYA.I> were 1.5 percent lower, as major travel companies rerouted flights to avoid Ukranian airspace. U.S. and Asian stocks fell sharply after a U.S. official said Washington strongly suspected the Boeing 777 was downed by a surface-to-air missile fired by Ukrainian separatists backed by Moscow. All 298 people on board were killed.  The disaster could prove a turning point for international pressure to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, which has killed hundreds since protests toppled the Moscow-backed president in Kiev in February and Russia annexed the Crimea a month later.
