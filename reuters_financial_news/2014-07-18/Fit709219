July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the new remuneration framework for gas distribution, transmission, regasification and storage activities approved by the Spanish government in a Royal Decree (RDL 8/2014) in early July removes major uncertainty around the Spanish gas system's sustainability at the expense of regulated revenues cuts and the removal of  inflation-linked yearly updates.  Fitch believes the reform will solve the incipient gas tariff deficit issue and  provide more stability to the regulatory framework with the implementation of  six-year regulatory periods. However, the cost of the reform will mostly be  assumed by gas-asset operators and it will reduce their regulated revenues and  erode EBITDA margins.  Fitch does not plan to take immediate rating actions on any of the Spanish gas  operators it rates following the new regulations, as the regulatory changes were  expected, and the impact on credit metrics is manageable.  For the most affected operator, Enagas S.A. <ENAG.MC> (A-/Positive), Fitch will analyse  the company's measures to mitigate the effect of the regulatory changes and will  assess the medium to long term impact on forecast credit metrics in the coming  months once a new strategic plan is unveiled.  The report, entitled 'Spanish Gas Sector Reform: System Sustainability at the  Expense of Lower Revenue Base' contains detailed explanation of the key drivers  of the Spanish gas reform and implications for the gas operators Fitch rates.
