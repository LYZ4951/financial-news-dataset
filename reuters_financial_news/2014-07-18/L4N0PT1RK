SHANGHAI, July 18 (Reuters) - A Chinese construction company at risk of posting a landmark bond default is getting support from its local government to hold off creditors and stock up cash, state media reported on Friday.

Huatong Road & Bridge Group Co Ltd said on Wednesday it was uncertain whether it could pay the principal on a 400 million yuan ($64.48 million) one-year bond set to mature on July 23 <CN041365009=>, due to an official investigation into criminal wrongdoing by its chief executive. However, Geng Naizhuang, described as an official from Huatong, was quoted in the official Shanghai Securities News saying that the company's local government is co-ordinating with the firm to facilitate the collection of outstanding bills due to the company.  The local government also held a meeting with the company at which it "suggested" that banks cannot force Huatong to pay off outstanding loans.
