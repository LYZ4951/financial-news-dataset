MUMBAI, July 18 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged higher on Friday, gaining for a fourth consecutive session, after better-than-expected earnings from Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> sparked a rally in IT stocks and offset global concerns over the downing of an airliner in Ukraine.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.31 percent higher at 25,641.56 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended up 0.27 percent at 7,661 points.
