LISBON, July 18 (Reuters) - Several minority investors in Portugal Telecom <PTC.LS> are preparing to sue the board over its decision to buy debt from a holding company of the troubled Espirito Santo family, a representative of the shareholders said.

Portugal Telecom has been forced to accept a smaller role in a planned merger with Brazil's Grupo Oi <OIRB3.SA> because one of the family's holding companies, Rioforte, failed to repay the debt to PT. [ID:nL6N0PS4H8]
