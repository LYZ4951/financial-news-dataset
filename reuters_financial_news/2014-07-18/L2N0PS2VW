SAO PAULO, July 18 (Reuters) - Despite grappling with a recession and a potential debt default, Argentina holds considerable promise for Brazilian investment-banking firm Itaú BBA as it looks to expand across Latin America.

Itaú BBA is planting flags in Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru - all investor-friendly countries which, unlike Argentina, have had vibrant capital markets activity this decade. Yet, when asked to pick one market where Itaú BBA would like to grow its business in the future, Chief Executive Officer Candido Bracher named Argentina, because of the bank's longstanding presence there and its future prospects. "Argentina is perhaps the country with the greatest potential, since it's a large market, it's under-banked, and we have a certain competitive advantage" there, Bracher said in an interview at Itaú BBA's new headquarters in São Paulo's financial district. "We have to wait, however, for a more stable economic environment." After assembling a full-fledged wholesale banking unit in Chile, where it is vying nose-to-nose for deal mandates with bigger global rivals, Itaú BBA is also gaining visibility in Mexico and Colombia. Bracher set Itaú BBA a goal to be among the top-five investment-banking fee earners in all of the five Latin American countries besides Brazil where it operates. Itaú BBA, which began wholesale banking operations in Argentina in 2006, is seeking to replicate the business model of its Brazilian unit across Latin America. According to Bracher, parent company Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA>, Latin America's largest bank by market value, wants international operations to account for 25 percent of consolidated earnings within five years, from 15 percent now. Currently, Itaú BBA offers financial advisory, sales and trading, lending, cash management and treasury services to Argentina's 300 biggest companies with a team of 104 people led by banker Cesar Blaquier. Yet, any attempt to expand Itaú BBA's $900 million loan book in Argentina will take time, Bracher said. The Argentine economy, the third biggest in Latin America, is in recession and high inflation is eroding household income. Foreign reserves are running close to their lowest level in eight years and the budget deficit is about 6 percent of gross domestic product, one of the highest in the region. President Cristina Fernández has until the end of the month to stave off default. Argentina missed a $539 million interest payment last month after a U.S. court blocked the payment unless it also pays holdouts from two bond restructurings that took place in 2005 and 2010. [ID:nL2N0P710U] Signs that Fernández is reversing years of hostile anti-market rhetoric are helping revive interest in Argentina. Over the past two years, she has compensated Spain's Repsol SA <REP.MC> for the seizure of an oil producer and reached a debt accord with the Paris Club. Furthermore, the main candidates for the presidential election next year are all promising more investor-friendly policies.
