SOFIA, July 18 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is ready to help Bulgaria deal with problems in its banking sector if it first comes up with a clear and coordinated plan, the bank's country director said on Friday.

The country's fourth-largest lender, Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, was shut down last month after a run on its deposits. The main political parties have so far failed to agree on a rescue plan for it. Earlier on Friday, the finance minister said the outgoing Socialist-led government was now hoping to engineer a private rescue rather than a public bailout of the bank. [ID:nL6N0PT2UR] The government initially planned to transfer Corpbank's good assets and liabilities to a recently acquired subsidiary of the lender, which would then reopen as a nationalised bank under a new name. But a lack of political agreement on that plan has required special legislation forcing the central bank to extend its administration over Corpbank for three more months and scrap its planned reopening on July 21. The EBRD, set up in 1991 to invest in the former communist countries of emerging Europe, has said it has been in contact with the Bulgarian authorities but has not been officially approached for support. "We are here to support Bulgaria. We do stand ready to help, but that depends on the plan and the commitment and the situation," Daniel Berg, EBRD country manager for Bulgaria, told Reuters. "The most important thing is that there has to be a decision by the authorities that they want to solve the problem in this or that way, before we can provide any help," he said. The EBRD has also participated in bank rescues in Latvia and Lithuania. In 2010, it took a 25 percent stake in a new state-owned Latvian bank Citadele that has taken on the good assets from failed Parex bank. The run on Bulgaria's Corpbank and subsequent hit to another lender have raised questions about the quality of banking supervision in the Balkan state, which joined the European Union in 2007. Depositors, unnerved by reports of shady deals involving Corpbank's main owner, Tsvetan Vassilev, and by a public feud between him and a business rival, withdrew more than a fifth of its total deposits. A subsequent audit showed activities at the bank "incompatible with the law and good banking practices" according to the central bank. Sofia is set to become the first administration outside the 18-nation euro zone to join the European Union's Single Supervisory Mechanism, set up in response to the global financial and euro zone debt crises. Berg welcomed that move, saying it would boost public trust in the system, help the national regulator carry out its supervision and make sure lenders follow the same rules as elsewhere in the 28-member EU. "This is a good plan. Banking is about trust and faith. It is important that the government continue to handle any bank situation well and carefully," he said. The EBRD, which has been operating in Bulgaria since 1993 and invested about 2.8 billion euros in the economy overall, did not expect Corpbank's problems to spread to the country's other 28 banks or to the region. Two-third of banks in Bulgaria are foreign-owned, mainly by EU-based banks. The largest lenders include Unicredit <CRDI.MI> Bulbank, Hungary's OTP <OTPB.BU> and Austria's Raiffeisen <RBIV.VI>.
