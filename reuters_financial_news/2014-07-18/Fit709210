July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned BOC Aviation Pte Ltd's [BKCHNO.UL] (BOC Aviation) AUD200m 5.375% senior notes due 2020 a final rating of 'A-'. The notes are issued under the aircraft leasing company's USD5bn euro medium-term note programme.  This is BOC Aviation's first issue of notes denominated in Australian dollars.  The rating follows the receipt of final documents.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated at the same level as BOC Aviation's 'A-' Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR). This is because the notes constitute direct,  unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations of the company, and will rank  equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  The IDR, presently on a Stable Outlook, reflects Fitch's view of a very high  probability of extraordinary support to BOC Aviation from its ultimate parent,  Bank of China Limited <601988.SS> (BOC; A/Stable).   RATING SENSITIVITIES Any perceived changes in BOC's propensity and ability to provide extraordinary  support to BOC Aviation would impact BOC Aviation's IDR and hence the issue  rating. Proceeds from the senior notes are for the company's new capital expenditure and  general corporate purposes.
