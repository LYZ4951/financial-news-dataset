PARIS, July 18 (Reuters) - Suez Environnement <SEVI.PA> agreed to buy the remaining stake in its Spanish water unit, Aguas de Barcelona (Agbar), from La Caixa, which will in turn become the French waste and water group's second-biggest shareholder.

Suez said it would pay for the 24.1 percent stake in Agbar with 22 million new shares and 299 million euros ($404 million) in cash, giving La Caixa a 4.1 percent holding in the French company, which it plans to raise to 7 percent in the near-term.
