Operating profit fell to 925 million crowns ($135.4 million) from a year-ago 1.50 billion, slightly above a preliminary figure unveiled July 10 as the group warned writedowns on projects and restructuring costs in Latin America would hit results.[ID:nL6N0PL1HH]  Construction order intake rose to 37.9 billion crowns from 36.0 billion, against a mean forecast of 35.9 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.[ID:nL6N0PR569]  Following are comments by Chief Executive Johan Karlstrom to Reuters:  ON MARKET OUTLOOK: "We have changed our market outlook first and foremost in Britain, where we have an order intake that is twice the size in the first half of the year compared with last year."  ON MAKING UP FOR HIT IN THE U.S. IN Q1 FROM HARSH WINTER:   "We expect to catch up the somewhat lower volumes we had in the first quarter, this year."ON GROUP TURNOVER: "The book-to-build in the first half of the year is at 118 percent. In other words, we are building up the order stock so volume will increase ahead. The increased order stock is in the United States and in Britain." "Lead times are long in our projects so .... it will happen gradually going forward."  "The increased order intake will, long-term, lead to increased turnover. By that I am talking about the coming years."   ON DEMAND DEVELOPMENT IN THE U.S. THIS YEAR: "I want to highlight a few areas. Demand remains good on large infrastructure projects. There is a clear increase in demand for the expansion of airports. ... Overall, U.S. infrastructure needs to be expanded and we see an increase in demand and more projects within that area." "We have a positive view on developments both this year and into next year (on infrastructure projects, including airports)." "We also see increased demand within the hospital sector, now that health care reform (has) landed."ON PRIVATE ENERGY-RELATED PROJECTS IN U.S. INDUSTRY:  "I see good chances for Civil to grow in that segment long-term. But in the short term we see that investors take (a) longer time to decide on large industry investments. They are still at a planning stage. We expect them to come but they seem to be moved forward in time." ON WHETHER LATAM CHARGES SUFFICE: "I have great respect for the complexity and level of difficulty that it always means when one terminates this kind of large projects that have certain delays."
