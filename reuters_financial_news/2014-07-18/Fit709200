July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded Elli Investments Ltd's  (Elli) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'B-' from 'B'. The Outlook is  Stable. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this  commentary. Elli is the parent company of the Four Seasons HealthCare group. The downgrade reflects changes in the regulatory environment within UK elderly  care homes, which is under greater scrutiny, Elli's high level of embargoes on  care homes (no new residents until inspectors' findings are rectified) and the  impact on costs, as well as its exposure to the elderly care market compared  with its rated peers. We forecast funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage  will exceed 7.5x in 2014 and only gradually decline thereafter. In addition,  senior covenant headroom is eroding quickly.  The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that profitability will stabilise  towards the end of 2014 and in 2015; albeit at levels structurally lower than  previously anticipated assuming that the current level of embargoes will not  increase further from 2013 average levels. It is also supported by lack of  meaningful debt redemptions until 2018, the steady visibility of earnings,  Elli's leading market position in the growing independent UK elderly care market  and its long-standing relationships with local authorities (LA) and the NHS. KEY RATING DRIVERS Occupancy Constrained, Margin Erosion Fitch does not foresee short-term scope for organic growth in Elli's occupancy  given the increased regulatory environment mainly reflected in the high level of  inspections and embargoes. Elli's rating factors in Fitch's assumption that the  level of embargoes will average 10-15 per year (from a peak of 28 in December  2013). This will affect Elli's margins as these inspections lead to the  requirement for additional resources; typically funded through more expensive  agency staff. Consequently we only envisage a modest increase in occupancy  levels in the near term.  Although we expect staff costs as a percentage of sales to peak at 64% in 2014  due to high agency costs and the impact of the increase in the minimum wage  (2013: 62%), each percentage point variance in staff costs represents, roughly  0.5x in terms of FFO gross leverage, all other things being equal, reflecting  the high operating leverage in a context of subdued fee increases.  High Capex in 2014 & 2015 As part of management's strategy to diversify further into private pay clients,  Elli's owner, Terra Firma has injected GBP50m into the business to fund a  refurbishment and rebranding programme, which together with cash flow from  operations will fund relatively high capex. We view the owner's support as an  important factor for the ratings.   Weakened Credit Metrics Elli's EBITDAR has declined over the past two quarters, leading to a  last-12-month March 2014 EBITDAR of GBP137.2m (2013: GBP146.3m) and higher  forecast FFO adjusted leverage of 7.8x at FY14, which has deteriorated compared  with our original forecast of 6.4x. Fitch believes that EBITDAR will remain  under pressure as the financial impact of increased embargoes continues. We  forecast FFO adjusted leverage to start falling to below 7x by FY16 on the back  of mild average weekly fee increases and cost control. As a result, we consider  the financial risk profile commensurate with a  'B-'  rating.   Dependent on LA Funding Elli currently has a high dependence on LA funding, which contributes more than  half of the group's revenues. Consequently, the exposure to low/stagnant fee  increases has contributed to slow growth in the revenues for the group. Fitch  believes that Elli's strong relationships with the LAs, provision of high  dependency care in the homes, and management's plan to grow the private segment  as part of the new business restructuring should mitigate the heavy exposure to  LA public sector funding.  Focus on High Dependence Service Elli's focus on high-dependence services in its elderly care division is  relatively resistant to the recent trend towards care at home and the associated  tightening in residential care eligibility criteria. In an environment of  reduced real spending on elderly care by the government, the nursing and complex  residential care segments will continue to benefit from a shift in the focus to  higher intensity of care.  Solid Market Positioning Elli enjoys a leading position in the growing independent UK elderly care market  and benefits from entrenched relationships with LAs and NHS commissioners.   Superior Recovery Prospects In our assumptions, we have taken the higher value derived from a liquidation  scenario, due to the high quality property assets on the balance sheet. In our  view, many of the homes are in a location with an oversupply of beds, whilst the  potential for alternative use is limited with the most likely option being  conversion to residential depending on the location and demand at the time. In  addition, we consider the position of unsecured bondholders weaker than secured  creditors thus supporting the view of less than par recoveries for the senior  unsecured notes at  'B+'/'RR2'  compared with  'BB'/'RR1'  previously.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Increase in FFO adjusted leverage to above 8.0x. (FYE 13: 6.80x) - Significant further decrease in occupancy rate due for example to a drop in  reputation and/ or ongoing high embargoes together with increased operating  costs leading to EBITDAR margin eroding to below 16%. (FYE 13: 20.3%) - FFO fixed charge cover below 1.1x, together with stretched liquidity  exacerbated by covenant breaches. (FYE 13: 1.3x). Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - FFO adjusted leverage below 6.5x. - FFO fixed charge cover ratio consistently above 1.5x.   LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Lower Liquidity Expected to Be Sufficient Elli's liquidity is supported by access to its revolving credit facility of  GBP40m maturing 2018, of which GBP25m was undrawn at FYE13. Together with  available unrestricted cash of GBP18.7m, Fitch considers this sufficient  relative to no meaningful debt repayment in 2014. The debt maturity profile of  the bonds is acceptable, with an average remaining maturity of 4.5 years. Elli's  ability to raise additional funding is restricted by debt incurrence clauses  under the terms of the bonds requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage above 2x,  which we calculated at about 1.6x at FYE13 (based on consolidated EBITDA) and  highly unlikely to reach 2.0x any time soon. We also note that senior covenant  headroom is tightening.
