SEOUL, July 18 (Reuters) - South Korea called off the planned sale of a stake in Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) <024110.KS>, a finance ministry official told Reuters on Friday, without giving details.

The government had put up for sale a part of its 60 percent stake in the bank at a discount of about 5 percent from its Thursday closing price, a source had told Reuters. Such a deal had been expected to raise up to 300 billion won ($290 million), according to a media report. [ID:nL4N0PS5RO]
