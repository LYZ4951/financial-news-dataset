July 18 (Reuters) - Peter Eastham, who headed Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' New York-based commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) rating group, will move to a senior position in Australia, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

About a third of the group has been let go, including Kurt Pollem, Barbara Hoeltz and analyst Brian Snow, the report added.(http://on.wsj.com/WjqTRZ) S&P, once the top player in CMBS ratings, lost its grip on the market in 2011 after a disastrous ratings slip-up on a $1.5 billion deal led by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. (http://reut.rs/1tfEZi1) S&P, which is owned by McGraw Hill Financial Inc <MHFI.N>,  has struggled to rebuild its once-dominant market share in the rating of commercial mortgage-backed securities.  The debacle badly eroded S&P's credibility and left it effectively frozen out the sector. It was kept out of so-called conduits, the multiple-borrower deals that make up the majority of CMBS transactions, for more than a year. The rating agency plans to merge its CMBS ratings team with its analytics division that monitors bond performance, according to the Journal.
