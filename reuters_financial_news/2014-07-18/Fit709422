July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Dignity's Finance plc's class A and B notes. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this release.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation is principally supported by Dignity's stable performance, which  is reflected in EBITDA growth above Fitch's base case assumption for 2013. The  trailing-12-month to December 2013 EBITDA was GBP88m, effectively growing  year-on-year by 12.7% (or a Fitch-estimated 7% when excluding the annualised  impact of Yew Holdings, its most recent acquisition). The EBITDA margin has  remained broadly flat year-on-year at 35.6%. This recent growth has been  achieved through a combination of price and volume growth as well as  acquisitions (which Fitch does not typically take into account for its base case  forecast).  Fitch's base case free cash flow (FCF) debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs) for  the class A and B notes (minimum of both the average and median DSCRs to legal  final maturity) remained broadly stable at 2.69x (from c. 2.72x) and 1.62x (from  1.68x), respectively. This base case conservatively assumes EBITDA growing at a  compounded annual growth rate of 0.8% over the next 10 years. These solid DSCRs  are also backed by an annuity-like debt profile, which contrary to other UK WBS  transactions, removes any point in time stresses.  EBITDA leverage has decreased due to a combination of growth in EBITDA and  amortisation of debt, allowing for a further decline in June 2014 to 1.8x for  the class A notes and 3.9x for the class B notes (down from 2.0x and 4.3x,  respectively, at tap in July 2013).  The acquisition of properties on short leaseholds over the years (exceeding the  acquisition of long lease/freeholds) means that Dignity has a material rental  cost, currently representing about 12% of its EBITDA compared with 10% back in  2006. As a result, taking into account the senior debt-like characteristics of  the rents, the rent-adjusted base case FCF DSCRs at 2.09x and 1.46x,  respectively, for the class A and B notes are notably lower than the FCF DSCRs,  albeit still in line with their ratings (notably for the most senior class A  notes).  The class A notes' rating is constrained by Fitch's rating cap for the funeral  home industry, which prevents them from being rated above 'A+'. Although the  funeral/crematoria services industry is largely non-cyclical and typically  benefits from stable and predictable cash flow backed by strong fundamentals  (with favourable demographics), it remains a highly fragmented niche market  (led, with the exception of the Co-op, by small non-diversified companies) and  hence is more vulnerable to any change in its operating environment (e.g.  competitive landscape).  The Stable Outlook is underpinned by the predictable and relatively stable  nature of the industry. Despite a steady decline in Dignity's market share (due  to increased local competition) and a reduction in the number of deaths in the  UK in recent years, both impacting volumes, the company has consistently grown  EBITDA through above inflation price increases (demonstrated low pricing  elasticity to demand) and a selective acquisition strategy (of both funeral  homes and crematoriums). An anticipated single digit increase in the number of  deaths is anticipated to materialise around 2015 with the ageing of the baby  boomer generation (source: ONS), thus providing further comfort about the  sustainability of Dignity's future revenue stream.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be adversely affected if performance dropped significantly  below Fitch's base case, notably due to potential future lack of ability to  apply above-inflation price increases or due to an accelerated loss in market  share (with a change in competitive landscape). A significant increase in the  number of short leaseholds could also negatively affect the ratings, as this  could increase the operating leverage of the transaction (with the increase in  senior debt-like rental payments obligations).  Dignity is a whole business securitisation of funeral homes and crematoria in  the UK, comprising 697 funeral homes and 39 crematoria. The Dignity group is the  second-largest provider of funeral services in the UK and the largest provider  of crematoria services.   The rating actions are as follows:  GBP161.9m class A secured fixed rate notes due 2023: affirmed at 'A+'; Outlook  Stable GBP206.3m class B secured fixed rate notes due 2031: affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook  Stable
