LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Britain's new competition watchdog said it plans to launch a full investigation into banking services for small businesses and personal current account customers later this year after finding a lack of competition among the big banks.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday essential parts of the UK retail banking sector lack effective competition and do not meet the needs of personal consumers or small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
