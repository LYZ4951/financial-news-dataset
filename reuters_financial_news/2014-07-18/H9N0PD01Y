HONG KONG, July 18 (Reuters) - China shares were slightly higher on Friday, as outperforming property developers and the consumer staples sector trimmed gains in the afternoon.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> inched up 0.2 percent to 2,059.07 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 0.3 percent. On the week, the two indexes were up 0.6 and 0.8 percent, respectively. China Vanke <000002.SZ> added 3.3 percent and Poly Real Estate <600048.SS> 4.1 percent, leading property gains after soft home price data triggered expectations of further mini-stimulus measures by local governments.
