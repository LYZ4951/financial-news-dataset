SEOUL, July 18 (Reuters) - The South Korean government is pressing ahead with the sale of part of its stake in Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) <024110.KS> and a deal was imminent, two sources at the country's finance ministry with direct knowledge of the matter said.

A banker with knowledge of the deal said the government has put up for sale a part of its 60 percent stake at a discount of about 5 percent from its Thursday closing price. Earlier in the day, a separate finance ministry official had said that the deal had been cancelled. The sale had been expected to raise up to 300 billion won ($290 million), according to a media report. [ID:nL4N0PS5RO] No other details were immediately available.
