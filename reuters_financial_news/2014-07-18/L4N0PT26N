BANGKOK, July 18 (Reuters) - Thai shares retreated on Friday as the suspension of an auction of fourth-generation (4G) mobile licences triggered sell-offs in telecoms stocks, while sentiment in Southeast Asia was broadly weak after the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane over Ukraine.

Thailand's military government suspended the 4G auction for one year with immediate effect, a move that could lead to a loss in investment and revenue in a sector that accounts for a tenth of the economy. [ID:nL4N0PT1HV] Shares of the country's biggest telecoms firm, Advanced Info Service Pcl <ADVANC.BK>, dropped 5.3 percent, while second-ranked Total Access Communication <DTAC.BK> fell 2.7 percent and No. 3 player True Corporation <TRUE.BK> eased 0.8 percent. The suspension made the growth outlook for telecom operators less attractive, said Parin Kitchartornpitak, a senior analyst with KTB Securities. "4G is a growth story for the telecoms firms," he said. The benchmark SET index <.SETI> was down 0.36 percent, trimming its gain so far in the week to 0.8 percent. In Kuala Lumpur, shares of Malaysia Airlines System Bhd (MAS) <MASM.KL> fell sharply after one of its planes was downed in Ukraine, raising pressure on the state-run carrier to try to restore investor confidence after the second major disaster in months. [ID:nL4N0PS4T2] Malaysia's key index <.KLSE> was down 0.5 percent, heading for a similar weekly loss. Among winners on the week, Singapore <.FTSTI> is poised to extend gains for a fourth week, adding 0.3 percent, and Indonesia <.JKSE> is set to rise 1.1 percent for a third week. Asian shares sagged on Friday and a drop in Treasury bond yields put pressure on the dollar after the downing of a Malaysian Airlines passenger plane over Ukraine sent investors scurrying into defensive assets.
