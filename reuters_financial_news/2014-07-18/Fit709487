July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that the Indian budget for the year ending 31 March 2015 (FY15) did not introduce any major new measures for the oil and gas sector and would be neutral for Fitch's rated oil and gas entities - GAIL Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation <IOC.NS>, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd <BPCL.NS>, Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> and Oil India Ltd <OILI.NS> - which are all rated 'BBB-' with Stable Outlooks. India will continue to use the current subsidy mechanism for price regulated  products, including the gradual price increases for diesel aimed at trimming the  state subsidy requirement. The budget did, however, include some measures to  encourage production from unconventional hydro-carbon resources. The government in the budget allocated INR634bn for petroleum subsidies to cover  under recoveries, the difference between the market price and government  regulated price. Of this amount, INR300bn is for subsidies incurred during FY14,  which leaves a balance of INR334bn for the current fiscal year. Fitch estimates  that the overall under recoveries are likely to be around INR1trn for FY15 (down  from INR1.4trn in FY14), as long as the monthly diesel price hikes of INR0.50  continue and there are no oil price shocks (see Fitch's "Indian National Oil  Companies Dashboard FY14" published on 4 July 2014).   The INR335bn state subsidy allocation for FY15 and the direct subsidies from  upstream companies of USD56 per barrel to the refining companies are broadly  adequate to cover the estimated total under recoveries. With the decline in  under recoveries and with it the lower state subsidy, a larger share of the  under recovery burden would be borne by the upstream players - Oil and Natural  Gas Corp Ltd <ONGC.NS> and Oil India Ltd.  On the upstream front, measures were announced to accelerate development of coal  bed methane reserves and use modern technological methods to revive old or  closed oil fields. The price of natural gas was set to double as it was to be  more market linked from April 2014. The decision was put on hold during the  general elections, and the new government had deferred a decision on the measure  to September 2014. Further deep-sea oil and gas exploration would be linked to  this decision as exploitation of expensive deep-water reserves would be  economically viable only if prices for domestically produced gas are raised. The  proposed higher gas price remains lower than the cost of imports, which have  been increasing to make up for falling domestic gas production over the last few  years.
