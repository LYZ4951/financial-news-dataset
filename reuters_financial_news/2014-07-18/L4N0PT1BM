* A Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew crashed Thursday in the battle-torn east Ukraine region of Donetsk, where U.S. intelligence agencies say it was struck by a ground-to-air missile. The U.S. agencies are divided over whether the missile was launched by the Russian military or by pro-Russia separatist rebels, who officials say lack the expertise on their own to bring down a commercial airline in midflight. (http://on.wsj.com/1mZNwEO)  * The White House late Thursday said the United States is "shocked" by the downing of a Malaysia Airlines <MASM.KL> flight near the Ukraine-Russian border and blamed Russia for fueling tensions that may have led to the disaster.

In an unusual move for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency on Thursday told the group that it should correct weaknesses in its proposed plan. The commission said to consider broadening the definition of equipment and facilities deserving protection and asked the group to allow the federal government to designate additional facilities eligible for increased security.

Airbus beat Boeing in the annual air-show bragging-rights contest, recording deals for 496 jets compared with the 201 plane sales that Boeing made. Airlines typically get big discounts, and several of the deals still need to be finalized.
