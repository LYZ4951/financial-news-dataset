LONDON, July 18(Reuters) - Britain's big banks could be broken up after the country's new competition watchdog said it plans to launch an investigation into services for small business customers and personal current accounts. [ID:nL6N0PT1GL]

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday there was a lack of competition among banks to meet the needs of personal consumers or small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The CMA said Britain's big four banks (including TSB, which was part of Lloyds last year) held 77 percent of the 65 million personal current accounts in Britain in 2013 and had 85 percent of the 3.5 million business current accounts.
