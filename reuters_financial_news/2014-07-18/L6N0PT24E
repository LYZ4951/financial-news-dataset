KIEV, July 18 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund expects to decide on a second tranche to Ukraine within weeks as part of its $17 billion bailout, the mission chief in the country said on Friday.

Nikolay Gueorguiev said the tranche could total $1.4 billion. The ex-Soviet republic received a first tranche of slightly more than $3 billion in May. "The mission has reached an understanding with the Ukrainian authorities on the policies necessary for the completion of the first review under the stand-by agreement... We expect this process to be completed within few weeks" he said.
