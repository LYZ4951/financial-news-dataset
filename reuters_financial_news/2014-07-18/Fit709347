July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Sino-Ocean Land Holdings  Limited <3377.HK> (Sino-Ocean Land) a Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-' with  a Stable Outlook, and a senior unsecured rating of 'BBB-'.  Fitch has also assigned Sino-Ocean Land Treasure Finance I Limited's proposed US  dollar senior unsecured guaranteed notes an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)'. The  issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sino-Ocean Land, a China-based  residential property developer.  The notes are rated at the same level as Sino-Ocean Land's senior unsecured  rating as they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated  obligations of the company. The final rating of the proposed notes is contingent  upon receipt of documents conforming to information already received. In rating Sino-Ocean Land, Fitch has applied the bottom-up approach detailed in  its Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage Criteria. Sino-Ocean Land is rated two  notches higher than its standalone rating of 'BB' to reflect its importance to  its major shareholder China Life Insurance Company Ltd. <2823.TW> (China Life; Insurance  Financial Strength rating of A+/Stable) Sino-Ocean Land's standalone ratings are supported by its strong focus and  leading position in targeted Tier 1 and 2 cities, experienced management team  with proven track record and diversified funding channels. The ratings are  constrained by its scale and diversification. In addition, Sino-Ocean Land's  leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory was 46% at end-2013, which  was relatively high compared with its peers.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Strategic Arm for China Life: Sino-Ocean Land is of high strategic importance to  China Life, which has positioned Sino-Ocean Land as its sole strategic real  estate investment platform in China. It increased its stake in the developer  from 16.57% in 2009 to 29% at present and is committed to own no less than 25%.  China Life also signed an agreement with Sino-Ocean Land to cooperate to exploit  synergies in their insurance and real estate businesses. Although China Life has  provided a written undertaking to support Sino-Ocean Land under certain  circumstances, this undertaking is not legally binding, and thus, is not a major  factor in Sino-Ocean Land's final rating. Strong Focus on Tier 1 and 2 Cities: Most of Sino-Ocean Land's 21m sqm of land  bank are located in Tier 1 and 2 cities - land in these cities make up 74% of  the company's total land bank by GFA and 92% by value in 2013. In addition, the  company has been the market leader in key cities, namely Beijing and Tianjin,  Zhongshan and Dalian, in the past three years. These cities together accounted  for 67% and 59% of contracted sales and 61% and 53% of contracted GFA in 2012  and 2013 respectively. As a result of its focus on these cities, the company's  contracted sales rose around 15% in each of the past four years. Slow Churn; Moderate Margins: For the past four years, Sino-Ocean Land was able  to maintain a moderate EBITDA margin of around 23%-27% given it focused on mass  market products and had a slower churn rate. For the same period, around 60%-74%  of Sino-Ocean Land's contracted sales were from smaller units of 70-150sqm and  total contracted sales to total debt was around 0.7x to 1x. Fitch expects this  trend to continue for the next two to three years. Higher Leverage Than Peers: Sino-Ocean Land's leverage, as measured by net  debt/adjusted inventory, has been on decreasing - it dropped from 65% in 2011 to  52% and 46% in 2012 and 2013 respectively. However, this is still relatively  high compared with its peers. However, given its diversified funding channels,  Sino-Ocean Land maintained a relatively lower funding cost, with effective  interest rate of around 6.5%-7% in the past three years Sufficient Liquidity: At end-2013 Sino-Ocean Land had CNY11.3bn cash and  CNY4.8bn restricted cash. Fitch expects the group to maintain sufficient  liquidity to fund development costs, land premium payments and debt obligations  during 2014-2016 due to its diversified funding channels from both onshore and  offshore capital markets, long-term relationships with onshore and offshore  banks and flexible land acquisition strategy.  Limited Scale: Sino-Ocean Land's rating is constrained by its geographical  concentration in the four key cities namely Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian and  Zhongshan, its limited contracted sales scale and lower ratio of total  contracted sales to total Debt (2013:0.95x) compared with similarly rated peers  and its limited recurring EBITDA interest coverage (2013: 0.05x).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - EBITDA margin sustained below 20% (2013: 20.0%) - substantial decrease in contracted sales  - net debt/adjusted inventory rising close to 50% (2013: 46.0%) - contracted sales/total debt sustained below 0.8x (2013: 0.95x) - evidence of weakening linkage with China Life  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - evidence of strengthening linkage with China Life
