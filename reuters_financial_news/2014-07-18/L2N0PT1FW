July 18 (Reuters) - Bill Gross, chief investment officer of bond investor Pimco, said on Friday the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note <US10YT=RR> belongs in the 2.50 to 3 percent range "now and for the next few years" if the Federal Reserve remains accommodative.

"When the Fed begins its upward journey - June 2015 - then it must be cautious and probably needs to stop at 2 percent sometime in 2017 because we have a highly levered economy, structural demographic headwinds which lower real growth and the effect of technology and job displacement," Gross told Reuters. "When the Fed begins, how quickly it proceeds and where it stops is critical to bond yields as well as stock prices."
