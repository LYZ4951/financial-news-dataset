July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed food and beverage company Findus PledgeCo S.a.r.l.'s (Findus) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B-' with a Stable Outlook, and Findus BondCo S.A.'s senior secured notes at 'B+' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR2'. The affirmation is based on the stabilisation of Findus's financial performance  and recent market share gains in a difficult frozen food market environment and  high key input prices, mainly salmon. Although Fitch expects Findus's funds from  operations (FFO) adjusted leverage to reduce towards 5.5x in 2016, some  uncertainty remains around one of its key markets, Norway, which has recently  seen some pressure on frozen sales. This is partly mitigated by resilience in  their UK chilled volumes. We expect mildly positive free cash flow (FCF) in  future years, therefore ensuring sufficient financial flexibility for the  rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Geographic and Product Diversity  Findus remains the leader in its key markets of Norway, Sweden, Finland and  France, with high market shares in branded frozen food and a diverse product  proposition of frozen fish and ready-to-eat meals. However, Fitch expects  increasing private-label penetration and competition from chilled food to  continue putting pressure on Findus group's profit margins. Cost savings, while  limited, are expected to remain the key driver of profit growth.  Volatility in Commodity Prices  Sudden commodity price inflation, such as the recent all-time high price of  salmon, in conjunction with greater volatility in food commodity markets will  continue to challenge Findus, especially in the event of a slowdown in consumer  spending. Meanwhile, the group is benefiting from continued investments in  product innovation and successful negotiations of contracts with food retailers  to pass on price increases in raw materials.  Scope for EBITDA Stability  Fitch expects product innovation and contract negotiations to mitigate raw  material price increases. We therefore project that EBITDA margins should remain  fairly stable at FY14's (year to September 2014) 8%. FY13 and 1HFY14  performances were in line with management's expectations despite challenges in  frozen fish sales in Norway. EBITDA margins returned to the FY11 level after  having previously been on a contracting path. Resilient Food Consumption  Consumption of fast-moving consumer goods is fairly resilient through the  economic cycle, although growth in mature and developed markets is limited.  Findus's product innovation capabilities and targeted marketing spending are key  to ensuring its product offering remains relevant to consumers amid changing  economic conditions, consumer preferences, health concerns and food price  inflation.   Improving FCF  Findus has historically generated low levels of FCF, which is considered a  weakness. Although we expect a mildly negative FCF margin in 2014 due to one-off  costs for refinancing, exchange rate translational differences and working  capital unwinding, we expect cash generation to improve, albeit remaining  relatively weak at around 1% during FY14-FY16.  High Leverage  Findus's FFO adjusted gross leverage at end of the financial year to September  2013 (FYE13) post refinancing remained high at 6.4x. Fitch expects leverage to  improve towards 5.5x with FFO fixed charge cover moving towards 1.8x by 2016. If  maintained, this leverage profile would be considered relatively strong for the  'B-' rating relative to close peers.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating actions include: - Improvement in operating profitability and organic business growth evidenced  by EBITDA margin improvement up to 9% (FYE13: 7.9%) and FCF margin of 3% or  higher (FYE13: 0.2%). - Further de-leveraging with FFO adjusted leverage to or below 5.5x on a  sustained basis (FYE13: 6.4x). - FFO fixed charge cover at 2x or above on a sustained basis (FYE13: 2.3x). Negative: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive negative rating actions include: - A contraction in organic revenue, for example resulting from increased  competitive pressures, combined with a steady reduction in operating  profitability leading to an EBITDA margin below 7%. - Consecutive periods of negative FCF leading to erosion of the liquidity  cushion. - A sustained deterioration in FFO adjusted leverage to or above 7x. - FFO fixed charge cover sustainably at 1.5x or below.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Adequate Liquidity   Fitch anticipates that Findus's liquidity will remain adequate, supported by a  super senior RCF of GBP60m and, in the longer term, mildly positive FCF  generation from FY15. No Maturities Before 2018
