STOCKHOLM, July 19 (Reuters) - Swedish banking group Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> on Friday posted a second-quarter net profit that beat forecasts on smaller than expected loan losses and as strong domestic demand boosted business.

Net profit for continuing operations rose 9.7 percent to 4.37 billion Swedish crowns ($639.53 million), beating a mean forecast for 4.04 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts. The Swedish bank said economic activity in Sweden continued to grow during the second quarter.
