LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Worldwide mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity has reached $2 trillion so far this year, 75 percent higher than last year, according to Thomson Reuters weekly data, helped by a string of large-cap companies striking high value deals.

Eight deals valued at more than $5 billion were announced this week, setting an all-time record for weekly deal making among companies with a large market capitalisation, Thomson Reuters said on Friday. The total value of deals over $5 billion hit $915.9 billion in the year to July 17, more than triple the level seen a year ago. One such deal came on Tuesday, when Camel cigarettes maker Reynolds American <RAI.N> said it would buy rival Lorillard <LO.N> for $26.8 billion. As part of the takeover, Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group <IMT.L> bought a number of brands and assets from both companies for $7.1 billion.
