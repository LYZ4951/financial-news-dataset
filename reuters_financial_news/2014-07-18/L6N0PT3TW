LAGOS, July 18 (Reuters) - Nigeria plans to raise 134.88 billion naira ($832.49 million) in treasury bills with maturities ranging between 3-months and one year on Wednesday, the central bank said on Friday.

The bank said it will issue 34.88 billion naira in the 3-month treasury bills, 48 billion naira in the 6-month paper and 52 billion naira in the one-year debt notes. Nigeria issues treasury bills as regularly as twice monthly to manage money supply in the economy and curb inflation. The auction result is expected to be released the following day.
