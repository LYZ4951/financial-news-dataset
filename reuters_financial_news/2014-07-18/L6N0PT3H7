ROME, July 18 (Reuters) - The Bank of Italy on Friday cut its estimate for 2014 growth to just 0.2 percent and warned that there was significant uncertainty about the outlook for the eurozone's third-largest economy.

In its latest quarterly bulletin, the Bank of Italy said it expected gross domestic product in the second quarter to be "approximately stationary" after it contracted by 0.1 percent in the first three months of the year. The central bank had previously forecast 0.7 percent growth for 2014 but it said recent economic data had pointed to a weakening in activity in the last few months. The central bank said its forecasts assumed "the full and coherent implementation" of measures to strengthen consumer confidence and investment in Italy and recovery in the eurozone as a whole.
