BELGRADE, July 18 (Reuters) - Parliament in Serbia adopted long-awaited legislation on Friday liberalising the labour market and raising the retirement age for women, the first in a raft of reforms designed to cut spending and attract investors.

The government is expected to move quickly to push through new legislation on bankruptcy and privatisation, as the basis to begin the restructuring of dozens of loss-making state-run firms.
