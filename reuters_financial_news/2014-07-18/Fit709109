July 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Seven Energy International Limited (Seven Energy) an expected Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B-(EXP)' with a Stable Outlook. The expected IDR takes into account a USD255m equity placement and assumes a successful issue of dollar-denominated  notes and repayment of certain existing debt. Fitch has simultaneously assigned Seven Energy Finance Ltd's proposed secured  notes an expected senior secured rating of 'B-(EXP)' and a 'RR4' Recovery  Rating. The company plans to use proceeds from the notes to refinance some of  its existing indebtedness and to improve its capital structure and liquidity.  The assignment of a final IDR is subject to the confirmation of the size of the  notes issue as the repayment of the upcoming maturities is key to maintaining  the company's adequate liquidity position. The assignment of a final rating for  the notes is also contingent on the receipt of final documentation substantially  conforming to the information already received. The proposed notes will benefit from guarantees and security from the parent  company, and a number of companies holding economic interest in the main  oil-producing assets (Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 4, 38 and 41) under the Strategic  Alliance Agreement (SAA) contract and a gas production asset (Uquo Field).  Revenues under the SAA agreement represented 100% of the company's EBITDA in  2013.   The notes benefit from a separate security package under the Accugas II and  Accugas III project finance facilities, which are secured on the property and  assets associated with the gas distribution part of the business, which is  currently in its early stages. The Accugas facilities benefit from an unsecured  guarantee from Seven Energy and in our recovery analysis we have assumed that  they will rank at least pari passu to the proposed secured notes in any  restructuring scenario.  The notes also include a cross-default provision, restrictions on dividends and  limitations on additional indebtedness, eg, total amount under other credit  facilities not to exceed USD450m or 20% of adjusted net tangible assets. Seven Energy is an integrated indigenous Nigerian oil and gas company focused on  onshore oil and gas upstream and midstream (gas processing and pipelines) in  Nigeria (BB-/Stable). It is currently developing a number of gas assets in  South-East Niger Delta. In 2014, it started delivering natural gas to a local  power station and acquired a contract supplying gas to an industrial consumer.  Both are under long-term fixed-price take-or-pay contracts. The company expects  to expand its gas business over the next two years, particularly with the  addition of another local power station as a customer that is expected to  commence consuming gas by end-2014. The Stable Outlook reflects our view that any improvement in Seven Energy's  credit profile may only come from the successful implementation of its gas  strategy, which we do not expect until end-2015 at the earliest. The company  faces inherent challenges to its growth ambitions eg, project execution risks  and the gas offtakers' potential failure to pay in a timely manner for  contracted gas. We believe that after the successful gas strategy implementation  Seven Energy will remain fairly small in size, will maintain a fairly complex  structure and will continue relying on onshore operations in Nigeria, thus  limiting its ratings to the mid-'B' category in the medium term. We forecast  that in 2014-2017 Seven Energy will maintain funds from operations (FFO) net  leverage of 3x or below, commensurate with a mid-'B' category rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Small E&P Producer Seven Energy is a small onshore-based Nigerian E&P company. Almost all of its  existing oil and gas production and cashflows come from SAA, a service-type  contract with the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a fully-owned  subsidiary of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  Its entitlement after taxes and royalties averaged 10.4 thousand barrels of oil  per day (Mbopd) in 2013. The small size of production and EBITDA relative to  other Fitch-rated E&P companies, in particular, Afren plc <AFRE.L> (B+/Stable) with 2013  production of 47 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboepd) or Alliance  Oil Company Ltd. (B/RWN) with 2013 production of 52 Mboepd, caps Seven Energy's  ratings in the mid-'B' rating category.  The SAA covers NPDC's 55% interest in Nigeria's North-West Niger Delta's oil  mining licences (OMLs) 4, 38 and 41, operated by Seplat Petroleum Development  Company <SEPLAT.LG> (Seplat), also a 45% stakeholder in these OMLs. Seven Energy sells its  oil at market prices to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L> (AA/Stable) at the Shell-owned Forcados oil terminal. The company expects that  its entitlements under the SAA will remain its principal production and revenue  source at least until end-2015.  Focus on Monetising Gas Seven Energy's strategy is to monetise natural and associated gas, which it  plans to supply to local power stations and industrial consumers. The company  aims to produce 73.3 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd) of gas in 2H14. In 2014  it has already begun supplying gas to consumers under long-term fixed-price  take-or-pay contracts. We believe that, when fully operational, the gas business  should improve Seven Energy's credit profile as it will provide a stable and  predictable revenue stream, assuming that its offtakers pay for gas fully and on  time. Seven Energy's gas operations are aimed at the domestic market and are,  therefore, subject to infrastructure constraints due to a fairly under-developed  gas pipeline network. Furthermore, one of Seven Energy's gas offtakers, a local  power station, is in the process of being partly privatised and, as such, does  not have an extended track record of payments for gas.  The company's project finance loans contain specific completion targets eg,  Uquo-Oron pipeline is to deliver gas to the Calabar NIPP power station by 1  January 2015; a failure by Seven Energy to achieve these targets would be an  event of default. The company's management believes that the pipeline is nearly  complete and therefore considers the risks of not meeting these deadlines as  minimal. Complex Structure, Strong Shareholders Seven Energy has a complex legal structure. It does not directly own or operate  any of the upstream assets that are currently generating its cashflows; its  economic interest in its principal oil asset is governed by the SAA. It is also  a minority shareholder in its gas production assets; neither does it operate  these assets. However, Seven Energy is entitled to up to 90% of production and  revenue until it recovers its costs and achieves a 15% internal rate of return,  while it pays 100% of associated project costs. While OMLs 4, 38 and 41 fields  have been producing oil for over 40 years, future successful production from  these fields depends on the partners' ability to develop contingent resources.  We also note that there is no operating history of the gas assets that Seven  Energy is currently developing. Seven Energy has recently secured USD255m in new equity from Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] (USD150m), the IFC (International Finance Corporation [IFK.UL]) (USD75m) and the IFC ALAC  Fund (IFC African, Latin American and Caribbean Fund) (USD30m), further  strengthening its shareholder base. This brings total equity contributions to   over USD1bn to date. The company plans to use the cash to fund development  expenditure on its project. New Pipeline Improves Security Risks remain over breaches of security in the Niger Delta region, where Seven  Energy has operations under the SAA. The recent partial closure of the single  sales channel for Seven Energy's production entitlement under the SAA - Shell's  Forcados terminal for nearly 40 days in March-April 2014 due to repairs to  sub-sea linkages damaged by bunkering resulted in a dramatic drop in oil  production on OMLs 4, 38 and 41 in March 2014 and during the first seven days of  April 2014 to 10.3Mbopd from 59.7Mbopd in February 2014. Thereafter, production  resumed to pre-shutdown levels.  To address security risks, in 1Q14 Seplat completed constructing a pipeline to  the Warri refinery in Nigeria to provide a second export route. Seven Energy  states that it will continue relying on the pipeline to Forcados for its  offtakes, while benefitting from the reduced shutdown of the field production  and may use the pipeline to the Warri refinery for partial offtake, if  necessary.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  -Successful implementation of gas strategy, both upstream and midstream, with a  track record of timely payment for gas by offtakers by end-2015 -Maintaining at least stable production volumes from the SAA, and successful  development of contingent oil and gas resources, over the medium term Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -Security-related shutdowns similar to the Forcados closure in the spring of  2014 that would stop SAA's production for a considerable period of time -Failure to achieve gas production targets and / or obtain timely payments for  natural gas from offtakers over the medium term -FFO adjusted net leverage of 4.5x and higher and FFO fixed charge cover of 4x  or lower on a sustained basis   LIQUIDITY AND DEBT
