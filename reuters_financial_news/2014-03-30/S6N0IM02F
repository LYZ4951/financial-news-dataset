SEOUL, March 31 (Reuters) - South Korea's seasonally adjusted current account surplus edged down to $7.57 billion in February from a revised $8.56 billion in January as both exports and imports shrank slightly, central bank data showed on Monday.

Exports last month fell by a seasonally adjusted 4 percent from the previous month to $52.50 billion while imports slipped by 2 percent to $44.53 billion. As a result, the trade surplus stood at $7.97 billion, the Bank of Korea data showed. In the financial account, Asia's fourth-largest economy saw a net outflow of $6.92 billion in February, without adjustment for seasonal patterns, compared to a revised net outflow of $4.48 in January.
