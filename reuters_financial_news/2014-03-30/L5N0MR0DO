The Sunday Times   INSURERS DEMAND CITY WATCHDOG'S HEAD AFTER MARKET BLUNDER Martin Wheatley, head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), faces calls for his resignation after a gaffe that wiped billions of pounds from the value of insurance companies. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) is expected to write to Chancellor George Osborne to complain about the FCA, which has been accused of creating a false market in insurers' shares over the way plans for a review of savings policies sold in the 30 years after 1970 were announced on Friday. Senior sources at four of Britain's biggest insurers have told The Sunday Times that Wheatley's position is untenable, the paper said.

MANSION TAX FEARS STALL LAND SECURITIES LUXURY FLATS PLAN Land Securities <LAND.L> has postponed plans to build 200 luxury flats near Buckingham Palace in the first sign that threats of a "mansion tax" are hitting the capital's economy.

STANLOW REFINERY ON BRINK AS DEBT TALKS LOOM The future of the Stanlow oil refinery, Britain's second-largest, has been thrown into doubt by a funding crisis.
