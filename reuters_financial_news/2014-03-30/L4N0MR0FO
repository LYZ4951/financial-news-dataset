* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.2 percent, a 1.1-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 0.3 percent on Friday and added 0.5 percent for the week.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> slipped 0.1 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended up on Friday but off their session highs as a late afternoon selloff in the biotechnology sector weighed on the overall market. * Copper hit its highest level in 2-1/2 weeks as speculation gathered pace that China could step in to stimulate its economy. Gold turned higher after touching six-week lows under $1,300 an ounce on Friday but marked its second straight weekly decline.  * Suncorp Group Ltd <SUN.AX> has announced its intention to raise A$250 million to fund capital requirements.
