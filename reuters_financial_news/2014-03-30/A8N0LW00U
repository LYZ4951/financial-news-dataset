ATHENS, March 31 (Reuters) - Greece's co-ruling conservative New Democracy party expelled a lawmaker early on Monday who failed to back in parliament a key reform bill demanded by the country's international lenders.

The government's majority shrank to just two seats after Athens lawmaker Nikitas Kaklamanis was expelled from the party's parliamentary group by Prime Minister and New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras.
