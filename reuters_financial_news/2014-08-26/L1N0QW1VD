WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. banks will not be able to include municipal bonds in mandatory buffers of easy-to-sell assets under rules nearing final approval, a person familiar with the process said on Tuesday.

The U.S. Federal Reserve weighed whether certain individual cities' and states' debt should count, but did not include them in the final rules, set to be approved on Sept. 3 as part of a global agreement to make banks safer, the person said. Under the rules, first proposed in October 2013, banks must hold enough assets that can be sold quickly so they can cope with customer withdrawals and post any required collateral in the event of a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

That prompted pushback from city and state officials, who said it could raise their borrowing costs.
