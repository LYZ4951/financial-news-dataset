FRANKFURT, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The balance sheet of the European Central Bank and the euro zone's national central banks contracted by 10.156 billion euros ($13.40 billion) to 2.013 trillion euros in the week that ended on Aug. 22, the ECB said on Tuesday.

The contraction came as banks repaid long-term loans to the central bank and took less in the ECB's main refinancing operations.
