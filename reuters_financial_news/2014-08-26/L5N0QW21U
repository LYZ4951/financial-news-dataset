STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Lending losses at Norway's top bank DNB <DNB.OL> will remain subdued in the time to come, the company's chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday.

"We expect relatively low loan losses going forward. There's solid equity in Norwegian companies, and they are well positioned to handle any ongoing changes that are taking place," CEO Rune Bjerke said on the sidelines of an energy conference. Despite investment cutbacks in the oil industry, DNB still sees growth in demand for loans, he added.
