NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 crossed 2,000, and the closing level will get there eventually too. With the milestone having been accomplished, there are a few things to think about headed into the last few months of the year.

For one, investors aren't holding a lot of cash. Margin accounts show that available cash (debt minus cash) as a percentage of stock market value comes to about negative 0.79 percent. That's the worst in 30 years at a time when that figure has been steadily worsening. Prior to the year 2000, low cash levels - as measured by this figure - were never much of a problem for the stock market, per data from Jason Goepfert of Sundial Capital Research. More recently, though, this figure's worsening trend has been a precursor to problems in the market, so while Goepfert is out there waving a flag about this, it's a yellow caution flag and not much more than that. Jack Ablin of Harris Bank has a few other sobering stats too. He notes that the S&P is currently trading at 1.7 times annual revenue, more than 20 percent more than the historic median, and the last time it traded above its current price-to-sales level was during the tech bubble of 2000. On the other hand, the market's earnings yield remains attractive - it's at six percent, more than two percentage points above triple-B corporate bond yields. The problem on this one would be if it says more about where interest rates are now than the stock market; if interest rates ever do rise again, stocks may correct and in a hurry. Eventually, the bears will be right, and there will be a bear market - but it doesn't appear in the offing for a bit. Still, it's worth noting at a time when the commentariat is increasingly worried about the length of this bull market - a neat stat notes that it took nearly 3,500 days for the S&P to hit 1,750 after first hitting 1,500 back in 2000, while the next 250 points took just 211 days.
