MOSCOW, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's biggest lender, is expected to post 82.8 billion roubles ($2.3 billion) in second-quarter net profit, down almost 4 percent year-on-year, due to higher provisions for possible bad loans, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.

Sberbank is one of five Russian banks subject to European Union sanctions which ban all EU nationals and companies from buying or selling new bonds, equity or other financial instruments it issues with a maturity of more than 90 days.  It made a net profit of 86 billion roubles in the second quarter of last year.  "Increased provisions for bad loans due to deterioration of macroeconomic conditions are pressing profit," said Olga Belenkaya, an analyst with Sovlink.  She added strong net interest and commissions income as well as cost control would cushion the fall in earnings.  On Tuesday, Russia's Economy Ministry raised its 2014 inflation forecast to 7-7.5 percent from 6 percent and cut its 2015 growth forecast to 1 percent from 2 percent, while keeping this year's growth forecast at 0.5 percent.
