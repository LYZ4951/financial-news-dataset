SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Lend Lease Corp Ltd <LLC.AX>, Australia's largest property developer, said on Wednesday annual net profit jumped 50 percent, meeting recently upgraded company forecasts, as it benefited from the sale of its stake in a UK shopping centre.

Net profit came in at A$823 million ($766 million) for the year to June 30, up from A$549 million the previous year and in line with the A$822.4 million average forecast of nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters StarMine.
