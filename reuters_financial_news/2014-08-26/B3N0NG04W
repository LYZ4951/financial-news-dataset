BUDAPEST, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold at a record low 2.1 percent on Tuesday in line with its guidance announced last month, when it ended its two-year easing cycle.

The central bank, which had steadily cut borrowing costs from a 7 percent peak in 2012, now aims to keep rates at a record low for a long period to help economic growth.
