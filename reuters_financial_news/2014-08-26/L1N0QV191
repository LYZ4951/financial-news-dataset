TORONTO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal <BMO.TO> reported a stronger third-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by gains at its Canadian and U.S. personal and commercial banking units and higher revenue at its capital markets arm.

Net profit at Canada's fourth-largest bank was C$1.13 billion ($1.03 billion), or C$1.67 a share, for the third quarter ended July 31, compared with C$1.12 billion, or C$1.66 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were C$1.73 a share. Analysts had expected C$1.66 a share.
