SEOUL, Aug 26 (Reuters) - South Korean shares closed higher on Tuesday, underpinned by stronger investor risk appetitive as bargain hunters locked in on laggard cyclical stocks such as builders and shipyards.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> finished up 0.35 percent at 2,068.05 points. Shipbuilders outperformed the broader index with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering <042660.KS> soaring 4.7 percent while Samsung Heavy Industries <010140.KS> gained 3.3 percent. ECB chief Mario Draghi's speech hinting at aggressive stimulus measures further stoked investor appetite for riskier assets. The South Korean won <KRW=> firmed against the high-flying dollar on exporter demand for month-end settlements.
