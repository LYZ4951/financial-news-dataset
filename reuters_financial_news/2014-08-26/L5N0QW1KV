BELGRADE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The Serbian central bank intervened on the currency market on Tuesday, selling euros to support the dinar after it fell to its lowest level versus the European single currency this year amid strong demand for the euro, dealers said.

The bank began intervening as the dinar fell to 118 to the euro, a 0.24 percent fall on Monday's close of 117.72. The dinar stabilised at around 117.5.   "Poor key indicators, increased subsidised lending in dinars, more demand for the euro, weak offer of the common currency - it all pushed the dinar's rate," a dealer said.
