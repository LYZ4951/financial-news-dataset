SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen edging higher on Wednesday after firmer U.S. data pushed the S&P 500 above 2,000 for the first time, with local attention on a raft of earnings results.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.2 percent to 5,605.0, but were at a 32.6-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark eked out a gain of 0.1 percent on Tuesday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> added 0.2 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday to lift the S&P 500 just a hair above the 2,000 mark, its first close above that milestone, after data that pointed to a brighter future for the economy. * Spot iron ore prices hit their lowest since September 2012 as swelling supplies weighed, while China's Dalian iron ore futures rebounded after a six-day slide that dragged the price down to the lowest level since last year's launch. * BC Iron Ltd <BCI.AX> said its full year net profit after tax was A$73.7 million, up 51 percent. [ID:nWNBS00NMB] * Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd <FLT.AX> reported its full year net profit after tax of A$206.9 million versus A$246.1 million last year. The company also said it is investing in UK-based Topdeck tours in a deal that values Topdeck at GBP 21.8 million. [ID:nWNBS00NMF][ID:nWNBS00NME] * Boral Ltd <BLD.AX> said it swung to an annual net profit, but missed estimates, led by a recovery in construction activity and lower losses at its U.S. business. [ID:nL3N0QV1YX] * Lend Lease Corp Ltd <LLC.AX> said its annual net profit jumped 50 percent, meeting recently upgraded company forecasts, as it benefited from the sale of its stake in a UK shopping centre.
