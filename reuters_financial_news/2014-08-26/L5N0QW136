NAIROBI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Kenyan insurer Jubilee Holdings <JUB.NR> increased its profit before tax 35 percent to 1.54 billion shillings ($17.4 million) in the first six months of this year, it said on Tuesday.

The company, which also operates in Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritius and Burundi, attributed the growth from the same period a year earlier to a 28.5 percent jump in gross premiums to nearly 13 billion shillings.
