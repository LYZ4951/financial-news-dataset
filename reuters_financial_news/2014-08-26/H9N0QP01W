HONG KONG, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark share index finished lower on Tuesday, as weakness in a few heavyweight stocks cancelled out strength in oil companies.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> slipped 0.4 percent from its highest close since May 2008, hit in the previous session, and finished at 25,074.50 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong inched up 0.1 percent. China Mobile <0941.HK>, which reached a six-year high last week, was the top drag on the Hang Seng, down 1.0 percent. Asia insurance giant AIA Group <1299.HK> lost 0.9 percent. Chinese state oil companies led index gains again after rising on Monday on Sinopec's <0386.HK> forecast-beating second-quarter profit. PetroChina <0857.HK> climbed 2.4 percent and CNOOC <0883.HK> 0.7 percent. Sinopec was down 0.8 percent from Monday's six-year high. Good earnings lifted some mainland property developers. Sunac China Holdings <1918.HK> surged 4.7 percent and Evergrande Real Estate Group <3333.HK> 4 percent. [ID:nL3N0QV1MY]
