SOFIA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A Bulgarian court ordered the seizure of property belonging to the main owner of troubled Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, Tsvetan Vassilev, the prosecutors said on Tuesday.

The Bulgarian fourth-largest lender's fate has been in limbo since June, when a run on deposits prompted the central bank to seize control of it and close its operations, sparking the worst banking crisis in the poor Black Sea state since 1990s.
