HONG KONG, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Global private equity firm KKR & Co LP <KKR.N> said on Tuesday it has hired Jaka Prasetya as managing director to lead the firm's credit and special situations initiatives in Southeast Asia as it expands its credit lending strategy in the region.

Prasetya, who will be based in Singapore, joins KKR from Leafgreen Capital, a firm founded in 2011 that provides finance to mid-cap companies in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Prasetya is joined at KKR by two of his partners at Leafgreen, Rahul Bhargava and Allan So, as the U.S. buyouts giant signals its plans to expand a business model it pioneered under its India head Sanjay Nayar. The business model adopted by KKR in Asia is very different to that in the United States and Europe, where private equity makes its profits through large buyouts. In Asia, loans as small as $50 million are a growing part of KKR's business.

KKR agreed to buy a 9.5 percent stake in food company PT Tiga Sejahtera Food Tbk, making that investment through its KKR Asset Management unit rather than its $6 billion Asia buyouts fund.
