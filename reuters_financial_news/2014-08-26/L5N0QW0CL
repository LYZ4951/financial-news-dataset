DUBAI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi-listed Islamic insurer National Takaful Co (Watania) <WATA.AD> said on Tuesday that United Arab Emirates regulators had approved the sale of 60.53 percent of the firm to MB UAE Investments and an affiliate of MB.

In a bourse filing, Watania said MB UAE Investments would acquire 51 percent and Al Madina Insurance Co would take 9.53 percent. The group would buy a total of 90.8 million shares. The deadline for the purchase is next Feb. 24, Watania said in the statement, noting that the regulatory approval did not constitute a commitment by the buyers to actually execute the deal. It did not give details such as the purchase price or who would sell the shares.
