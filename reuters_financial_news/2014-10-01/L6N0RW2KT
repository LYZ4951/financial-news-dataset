MOSCOW, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund halved its growth forecast for Russia for 2015 to 0.5 percent in gross domestic product terms on Wednesday, saying that uncertainty over geopolitical tensions brought downside risks to its estimates.

"Geopolitical uncertainties are having a big direct impact on the Russian economy," Antonio Spilimbergo, the IMF's mission head to Russia, told journalists.
