SEOUL, Oct 1 (Reuters) - South Korean shares tumbled to a fresh 2-1/2 month low on Wednesday over nagging concerns of a slowdown in China's economy, exacerbated by the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> fell 1.41 percent to close at 1,991.54 points. Among notable decliners, LG Electronics <066570.KS> dove 4.4 percent as analysts predicted a rough forecast in the smartphone market with rival Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> and low cost Chinese competitors expected to provide stiff competition. LG Electronics' key supplier and fellow group affiliate LG Display <000660.KS> fell 4 percent, weighed by concerns over lacklustre earnings with the one-time boost of iPhone 6 related orders seen to steadily dwindle. The South Korean won <KRW=> fell to a fresh 6-month low, with foreign investors cutting their exposure to risky emerging markets in favour of safe-haven bids in the dollar as global risk appetites turned sour.
