LISBON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Mexico's Grupo Angeles has withdrawn its 430-million-euro ($541  million) bid for Portugal's Espirito Santo Saude <ESSS.LS>, saying it was unable to go above China's Fosun <0656.HK> offer for the hospital business of the indebted Espirito Santo family.

Grupo Angeles initially offered 4.3 euros a share and raised this to 4.5 euros. It decided not to increase its offer after Fosun International bid 4.82 euros a share, the company said in a statement late on Tuesday.  The Espirito Santo banking family's main holding companies need to sell assets after requesting creditor protection in July as it labours under a mountain of debt that also led to a multi-billion euro state rescue of Banco Espirito Santo. [ID:nL3N0QW3UV] ESS shares fell 0.35 percent to 4.873 euros in early trading but were still above Fosun's offer, suggesting some investors see scope for a higher bid. ESS shares have risen 56 percent since their market debut in February. The all-cash bid by Fosun's Portuguese insurance unit Fidelidade values the health company at 460.5 million euros.[ID:nL6N0RS089]
