MUMBAI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Wednesday as blue-chips such as ITC <ITC.NS> declined as traders refrained from building positions in a holiday truncated week, while foreign investor sales also weighed on sentiment.

Markets will be shut until Monday and re-open for trading on Tuesday. ITC provisionally fell 1.6 percent while Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> ended 2 percent lower.
