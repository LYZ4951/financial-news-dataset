Oct 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government has shelved plans to move the HealthCare.gov insurance website to a new host, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.

The decision represented "the best path forward to ensure a successful second open enrollment period. It was made in order to improve the consumer experience and have sufficient time for testing," the journal reported, citing Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   To read the WSJ article click here: http://on.wsj.com/1rNgGtH  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  The agency signed a contract last November to replace Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N> with Hewlett-Packard Co <HPQ.N> as the host of the HealthCare.gov website.

Albright also said the agency was taking other steps to manage peak traffic, including transferring around 75 percent of newcomers visiting the site to a portion hosted by Amazon Web Services.
