BOSTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Prominent investor shareholder advisory firm ISS called on Allergan Inc. <AGN.N> to give its shareholders a chance to vote on any large, buyout-blocking acquisitions and said the company's board faces a credibility problem as it has promised to enhance value for shareholders, according to an ISS report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.

The report comes as the firm's largest shareholder, hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, is urging the Botox maker to sell itself to rival Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.TO>. Allergan has rebuffed Valeant's offers and has instead been trying to buy Salix for cash, people familiar with the matter have said. Such an acquisition would make Allergan too big and expensive for Valeant or another buyer. ISS said Allergan's largest shareholders feel uneasy about the board's stewardship and have felt compelled to say so publicly.
