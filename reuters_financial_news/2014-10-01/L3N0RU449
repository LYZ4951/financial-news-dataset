DUBAI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU> (ENBD), Dubai's largest lender, has priced a 100 million New Zealand dollar ($77.6 million) five-year bond, in what the lender said was a first in the currency from a Middle Eastern borrower.

The 6 percent coupon translates to spread of 165 basis points over New Zealand midswaps, the rate at which the deal was initially marketed on Monday, the bank said in a statement. [ID:nL6N0RU0YW] "This represents the cheapest five-year funding raised by Emirates NBD in the last six years," said Shayne Nelson, chief executive of ENBD. The issue, arranged by ANZ <ANZ.AX> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, came at a reoffer price of 99.664, a separate document showed.
