MILAN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Pimco, the world's biggest bond investor, remains overweight on Italian government debt after the departure of Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross, the asset manager's European strategist said on Wednesday.

News that Gross was leaving the company triggered sales on Italian and Spanish bonds last Friday as some investors feared the fund may change strategy. [ID:nL6N0RR37A] "Our view on Italian BTP remains the same as per our previous statement," Myles Bradshaw, who is also Pimco's executive vice president, told Reuters. "We remain overweight to Italy in our global portfolios."
