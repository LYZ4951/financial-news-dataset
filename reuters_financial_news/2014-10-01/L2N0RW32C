NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - VWR Corp <VWR.O>, a provider of laboratory supplies and services, priced its initial public offering at $21 per share, lower than the price range it had previously indicated, raising $536 million, a bookrunning source said on Wednesday.

VWR, backed by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, had said last month it expected its common stock to be priced between $22 and $25 per share. The IPO now values the company on pro forma basis at about $5 billion, including debt. [ID:nL3N0RI3FZ] VWR sells laboratory products such as chemicals, reagents, consumables, durable products and scientific instruments to more than 120,000 customers, primarily in North America and Europe. BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs & Co and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters to the IPO.
