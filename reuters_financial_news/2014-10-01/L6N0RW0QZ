KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Oman's Bank Sohar <BKSB.OM>, which is in the process of merging with larger rival Bank Dhofar <BDOF.OM>, said on Wednesday that Chief Executive Mohamed Abdulaziz Kalmoor had resigned for personal reasons.

Rashad Ali al-Musafir, the bank's chief financial officer, would replace Kalmoor as acting CEO for an interim period, the bank said in a bourse filing. Bank Sohar is considering a merger with Bank Dhofar that would create the sultanate's second-largest lender by assets. In June, Bank Dhofar proposed a preliminary share swap ratio after first approaching Bank Sohar about a tie-up in July 2013. [ID:nL6N0OJ0TX]
