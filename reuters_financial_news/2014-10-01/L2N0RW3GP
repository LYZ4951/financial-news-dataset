Oct 1 (Reuters) - The judge presiding over the Stockton, Calif., bankruptcy case said he will wait until late October to make a final ruling over whether the city can exit bankruptcy.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Klein said late on Wednesday afternoon that he was "not in a position to make a decision right now, in light of everything said today," and scheduled a new hearing for Oct. 30.
