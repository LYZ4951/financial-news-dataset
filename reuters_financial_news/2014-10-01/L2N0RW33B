NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association maintained Pimco on its watch list at a board meeting on Wednesday, less than a week after the bond fund manager's former chief investment officer resigned.

The retirement association, which has $200 million of its $4 billion in assets invested with Pimco, placed the Newport Beach, California, company on watch earlier this year, after the departure of prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian. "Our decision to go with Pimco had a lot to do with his (El-Erian's) vision," said Becky Van Wyk, the association's interim retirement administrator.  She added that the association's consultants, Wurts & Associates, are expected to update the board on Pimco in the future. Bill Gross, the bond market's most renowned investor, quit Pimco for distant rival Janus Capital Group Inc <JNS.N> on Friday, the day before he was expected to be fired from the huge investment firm he cofounded more than 40 years ago.
