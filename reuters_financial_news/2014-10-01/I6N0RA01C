BERGAMO, Italy Oct 1 (Reuters) - UniCredit <CRDI.MI> CEO Federico Ghizzoni said on Wednesday he was "extremely satisfied" by the performance of Central and Eastern European markets where the Italian lender operates, including Bulgaria and Romania.

Bad loans at Bulgarian banks have already peaked apart from a possible future spike stemming from troubles at Corpbank, the chief executive of major lender UniCredit's Bulgarian subsidiary, Bulbank, said on Monday. [ID:nL6N0RQ0VO]
