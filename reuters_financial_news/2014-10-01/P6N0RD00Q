PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - European shares dipped early on Wednesday, starting the new quarter in the red as sales warnings from UK retailer J Sainsbury <SBRY.L> and French cable maker Nexans <NEXS.PA> fuelled worries over the outlook for European corporate results.

At 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,377.07 points. Shares in Nexans tumbled 5.6 percent after the firm said full-year revenue would be flat as sales dropped by around 4 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. [ID:nFWN0RV040] J Sainsbury cut its full-year sales after trading fell sharply in the second quarter, dragged down by intense competition in a UK grocery market. However, its stock inched higher, up 0.3 percent as traders cited relief the firm didn't slash its dividend. [ID:nL6N0RW0KP]
