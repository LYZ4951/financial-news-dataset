BERLIN, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Rocket Internet <RKET.DE>, the global e-commerce investor, has priced its initial public offering at the top end of the range, with the price per share fixed at 42.50 euros ($53.61), it said on Wednesday.

The Berlin-based group had offered its shares in a 35.50-42.50 euros apiece range, and then brought its IPO forward by one week, citing "exceptional investor demand" for its shares.
