LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Jonathan Hill, the new European Commissioner for financial services, is being grilled in the European Parliament on Wednesday.

He faces challenges from some lawmakers who are unhappy someone from non-euro zone Britain would be supervising a core part of the new euro zone banking union. If he gets the green light from lawmakers, he would continue with measures remaining from his predecessor, Michel Barnier, under whose watch more than 40 new laws were approved in a bid to avoid a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis that forced taxpayers to bail out banks. Hill's five-year stint won't keep up the same break-neck pace of rulemaking but his agenda will nevertheless include groundbreaking plans for a new capital markets union.  BARNIER'S LEFTOVERS * Money market funds: Battle continues over whether one type of fund, known as constant net asset value (CNAV), should hold a cash buffer. * Regulating market benchmarks: Allegations of currency market manipulation by banks and more fines due for rigging Libor to fuel debate over proposed law to regulate leading benchmarks used by investors. * Structural reform of banks: Draft law proposes limits on banks taking bets on markets with their own money. Britain, Germany and France already introducing similar curbs. * Shareholder rights: Draft law proposes that listed companies must get shareholder approval on pay for top executives, aimed at ending "short termism" at banks and other major companies. * Review of financial watchdog powers: EU lawmakers and member states will decide whether to increase the powers of bloc's markets, banking and insurance watchdogs. Britain opposed to more national powers shifting to EU level. * Liquidity coverage ratio: European Commission to finalise a new rule requiring banks to hold a buffer of cash and bonds to tide them over short-term market shocks unaided. Rule set to bust a global agreement. * Financial trasaction tax: Not part of Hill's portfolio but has a major impact on the financial sector. Eleven euro zone countries, including France and Germany, continue work to tax financial transactions to force banks to pay back some of the money they received in the crisis. Shares and equity derivatives seen as initial targets but divisions over substance.  HILL'S AGENDA * Capital Markets Union: A core programme for the European Commission to kick start flagging economy and create jobs. Early priority is defining "high quality" securitised debt which pools loans into a security to raise funds for investment. Better information on small company credit status and finding agreement on European Long Term Investment Funds also a priority. * Draft law on ensuring the institutions like clearing houses can be wound down smoothly if they get into trouble.
