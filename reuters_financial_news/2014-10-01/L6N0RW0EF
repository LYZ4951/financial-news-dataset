DUBAI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Energy firm Dana Gas <DANA.AD> may support Abu Dhabi's bourse on Wednesday after signing a deal with Egypt that will help it to recover most of the $280 million it is owed by the Cairo government.

Political turmoil and violence since the 2011 revolt that ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak has hit the economy hard and Egypt has struggled to pay foreign companies for gas, with some major gas projects grinding to a halt at a time when generous state subsidies are stoking demand. Dana says it is owed $280 million in outstanding payments but that a new Gas Production Enhancement Agreement (GPEA) will permit it to drill 37 new wells and redevelop existing ones, providing additional condensate production that it can sell on the international market.

Separately, Oil Minister Sherif Ismail said on Tuesday that Egypt aimed to pay back $2 billion to $3 billion it owes to oil and gas companies by the end of the year.
