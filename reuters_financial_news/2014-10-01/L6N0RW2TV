PRAGUE, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Czech lender Komercni Banka expects its net profit to be flat on the year in 2014, improving its outlook due to shrinking risk costs and a strengthening recovery in corporate lending, its chief financial officer said in an interview.

Komercni Banka, 60 percent-owned by France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, has seen income from interest squeezed like other Czech lenders by record low borrowing costs as monetary policymakers expect to keep official rates near zero and the crown currency weak until 2016. While the export-reliant Czech economy is picking up steam, loan demand growth has been slower to recover. Komercni Banka had earlier scaled back its expectations for growing the loan book this year but its CFO, Libor Lofler, told the Reuters Eastern European Investment Summit that he was confident in the bank's latest outlook for 3 percent loan growth this year. "Maybe why I'm a bit more confident... is that we saw and can see improvement on the corporate side (of loan demand)," he said. "In the second quarter and even the third quarter, corporate demand for lending is increasing. We said we expected that, but we were not sure about the time lag and the magnitude." The bank forecasts its cost of risk, reflecting provisions against losses from loans and investments, to drop to very low levels this year due to unexpected releases. "So in terms of net profit, we would be flat year-on-year," Lofler said. "The (cost of risk) level is low... It will go up (next year) because we will grow lending." The bank's previous full-year profit forecast saw around a 1.5 percent drop from last year's 12.5 billion crowns. Lending is seen rising 5 to 6 percent in 2015, Lofler said, leading to about flat revenue after a revenue drop of up to 2 percent in 2014.  The bank may also look next year to change its dividend policy of paying 60-70 percent of net profit. At the moment the bank sees itself sticking to the top of that range, he said.  "For us it is to consider and to establish a new guidance on the dividend payout," he said. "(It is) not yet decided, but we are aware and conscious... that we generate more capital, simply said, than we need to even finance a relatively dynamic growth of our balance sheet." He said he did not expect the crisis in Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists have battled government forces in the east, to derail the Czech economy or cause any major issue for the bank's own loan portfolio.
