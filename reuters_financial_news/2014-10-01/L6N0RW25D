DUBAI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - One of Dubai's top government officials confirmed on Wednesday that Dubai World's [DBWLD.UL] biggest creditors have agreed a deal with the state-owned conglomerate to renegotiate its debt repayment schedule.

Sources told Reuters last month that agreement had been secured with the creditor committee of banks including HSBC <HSBA.L> and Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>. Under the new deal, the repayment date of the biggest chunk of debt under Dubai World's $25 billion restructuring would be extended, in exchange for a series of incentives.
