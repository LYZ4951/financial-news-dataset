LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Tesco <TSCO.L> said Britain's financial watchdog had started a full investigation into the company in the wake of an accounting scandal which wiped 3 billion pounds ($4.86 billion) from the British grocer's stock market value last month.

"Tesco will continue to co-operate fully with the Financial Conduct Authority and other relevant authorities considering this matter," the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
