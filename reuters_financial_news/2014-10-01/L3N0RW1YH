SINGAPORE, Oct 1 (Reuters) - United Overseas Bank <UOBH.SI>, Singapore's third-biggest bank by assets, has won a limited banking licence in Myanmar, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.

A UOB spokeswoman declined to comment. The source declined to be identified before a public announcement from Myanmar's central bank, which is expected to unveil the results of the bidding later in the day. Between five to 10 banks are set to gain a licence.
