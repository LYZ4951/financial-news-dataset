FRANKFURT, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Germany's second biggest lender Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> is cutting 60-70 jobs in its fixed income and currencies division in Frankfurt, several sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Commerzbank is offering severance packages and is aiming to carry out redundancies through voluntary layoffs, the lender said.   Commerzbank last year combined the sales and trading arms of its fixed income and currencies business.
