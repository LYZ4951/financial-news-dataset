FRANKFURT, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Rocket Internet <RKET.DE>, the global e-commerce investor, will likely price its flotation at the upper end of the 35.50 euros ($44.75 dollar) to 42.50 euros a share price range, three people familiar with the deal said.

"Books for retail investors are still open until 5 o'clock (German time), and no final price has been set. But it certainly looks like the price will be 42.50 euros," one of the people said.  The shares are poised to be priced Wednesday night with trading to start on Thursday.
