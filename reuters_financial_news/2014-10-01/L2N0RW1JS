BOSTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Vanguard Group's global fixed income chief said Wednesday the company has tightened controls at some of its long-term bond funds to screen out "hot money" amid heavy cash outflows from rival Pacific Investment Management Co.

"We have a very robust process in place that screens out hot money," said Greg Davis, who oversees more than $800 billion in bond assets at Vanguard. "We've always had tightened controls. We've tightened them up some more." Outflows from Pimco's Total Return Bond Fund <PMBIX.O> have accelerated after star bond manager Bill Gross left the company last week to take a job at Janus Capital Group Inc <JNS.N>, a much smaller company. Davis said controls have been tightened, for example, at the $121 billion Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund <VBMPX.O> because it is a prime substitute for the large Pimco fund formerly run by Gross.
