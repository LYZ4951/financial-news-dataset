LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Ukraine's debt insurance costs in the five-year credit default swaps (CDS) market surged to seven-month highs on Wednesday as investors awaited payment on a $1.6 billion state-guaranteed Eurobond that matured on Sept. 30.

Data from Markit showed that CDS rose 30 basis points from Tuesday's close to 1,322 basis points - the highest since end-February.
