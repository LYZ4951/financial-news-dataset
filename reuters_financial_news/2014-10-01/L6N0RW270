Oct 1 (Reuters) - Alternative investment manager Investcorp <INVB.BH> will complete the $1.43 billion sale of Berlin Packaging to Oak Hill Capital Partners in the first week of October, it said in a statement on Wednesday.

The Bahrain-based firm bought a majority stake in 2007 in Chicago-headquartered Berlin Packaging, which makes rigid plastic, glass and metal containers.
