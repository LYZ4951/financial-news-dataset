LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Songbird Estates <SBDE.L>, the majority owner of London's Canary Wharf estate, has sold one of its properties in the east London financial district to Crosby Investment Holdings for 153.5 million pounds ($249 million).

The 11-storey building at 50 Bank Street, which is mostly let to asset management firm Northern Trust <NTRS.O> until 2022, generates annual rent of around 8.58 million pounds, the property company said. Songbird Estates aims to use the proceeds from the sale to help fund the construction of a 58-floor residential tower to the east of Canary Wharf and the redevelopment of the Shell Centre next to the River Thames, it said.
