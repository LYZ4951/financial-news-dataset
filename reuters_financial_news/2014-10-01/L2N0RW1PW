NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - BATS Global Markets has narrowed its search for a new president to two industry executives with close ties to the No. 2 U.S. stock market operator, three sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.

Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer of trading firm Virtu Financial, and Jose Marques, global head of electronic trading at Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, are the front-runners for the position, the sources said. Neither candidate, however, is guaranteed to take the job and others remain in the mix, one of the sources said.
