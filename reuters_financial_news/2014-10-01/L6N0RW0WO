MOSCOW, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Russia's Central Bank will look into possible attempts at market manipulation through reports about the bank mulling the introduction of capital controls, TASS news agency reported on Wednesday.

The Central Bank denied a media report on Tuesday that Russia was weighing the introduction of temporary capital controls. The report sent the rouble tumbling.
