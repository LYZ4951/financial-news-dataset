SYDNEY, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd <VAH.AX> on Thursday said the foreign investment review board has given its nod to the proposed acquisition of a 35 percent stake in its frequent flyer program.

Virgin Australia expects the transaction to be completed by October end. In August, Virgin announced the sale to private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners after annual net loss tripled. [ID:nL3N0QY628]
