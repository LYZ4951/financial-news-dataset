LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Investors loading up on some of the euro zone's riskiest government bonds on expectations that the European Central Bank will buy them are making a "mistake", BlackRock's head of European and global bonds said on Wednesday.

"The market is very much taking for granted that quantitative easing through a government bond purchase programme is coming and I think there are many, many obstacles to that still to come," Scott Thiel, who oversees assets worth around $100 billion for BlackRock, told Reuters. "If people are buying Spanish and Italian bonds because they think the ECB is going to buy them from them, I think that is a mistake."
