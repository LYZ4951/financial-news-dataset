DUBAI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Developer Barwa Real Estate <BRES.QA> helped lift Qatar's bourse on Wednesday after announcing a land sale deal with the government, while Abu Dhabi's Dana Gas <DANA.AD> rose after signing a new contract in Egypt.

Qatar's benchmark <.QSI> rose 0.2 percent as shares in Barwa jumped 3.5 percent and were among the main supports. Barwa said on Wednesday it would sell land worth 2.54 billion riyals ($697.4 million) to the government, the latest state assistance which the indebted developer has received.  The sale will have a positive impact on the company's financials, it said, although Barwa did not specify which when this would be. Abu Dhabi's index <.ADI> rose 0.5 percent heavyweight Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank <ADCB.AD> climbed 1.5 percent. Shares in energy firm Dana Gas <DANA.AD> gained 2.9 percent after it announced a deal with Egypt that will help it to recover most of the $280 million it is owed by the Cairo government. Political turmoil and violence since the 2011 revolt that ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak has hit the economy hard, and Egypt has struggled to pay foreign companies for gas, with some major gas projects grinding to a halt at a time when generous state subsidies are stoking demand. Dana says it is owed $280 million in outstanding payments but that a new Gas Production Enhancement Agreement (GPEA) will permit it to drill 37 new wells and redevelop existing ones, providing additional condensate production that it can sell on the international market.
