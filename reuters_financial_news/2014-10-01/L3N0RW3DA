BANGKOK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Thai shares eked out small gains on Wednesday, as top energy firm PTT Pcl <PTT.BK> rallied to a near 20-month high after gas price hikes and the military government's $11.2 billion measures to revive the domestic economy.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> ended up 0.11 percent after a weak session on Tuesday when data showed the domestic economy lost traction in August amid contractions in trade and weak private consumption. [ID:nL3N0RU4CG] [ID:nL3N0RW326] PTT shares climbed 1.7 percent to 366 baht, their highest close since February 2013. On Tuesday, they rose 2 percent as an increase in price of natural gas for vehicles (NGV) boded well for the future of its loss-making NGV business. [ID:nL3N0RV38C] Other markets were mostly range-bound, with Asian stock markets slipping amid caution due to unrest in Hong Kong. [MKTS/GLOB] Fund flows to Southeast Asia were mixed, with the Thai bourse reporting net foreign buying of 1.64 billion baht ($50.5 million). [TH/TRADING02]
