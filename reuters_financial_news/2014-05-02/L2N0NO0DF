NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - If the U.S. economy indeed is going to shake off the weather-related problems and push higher in coming months, one of its biggest bettors is likely to remain Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> this weekend reports results and holds its Omaha confab that brings in investors, fans and interested parties alike. Warren and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will sip Coke, talk up their investments and reveal what else it is they're looking at about now.

Buffett famously couldn't find a bear on Berkshire this time around (bears on Berkshire being the market's equivalent of the Washington Generals - foils to the Harlem Globetrotters - just looking to be a punching bag), so they'll have other analysts asking them questions. One of the more pertinent ones will be what companies Buffett might be eyeing for potential acquisitions in the coming years. That's not an easy one to suss out. Buffett famously hates newfangled stuff that smacks of a fad. He partnered with 3G Capital last year to buy Heinz in a $23 billion deal, and so he may not go alone if he hunts for another "elephant" as he likes to put it. He told Reuters' Luciana Lopez last week that such a template could be used again, saying "If I live long enough, we'll do another one." Buffett has underperformed in the last five years, and it's not hard to see why; the S&P 500's total return from 2008-2013 was 128 percent; Berkshire saw its net worth grow 91 percent during that time. It's the first time in nearly half a century that the Berkshire book value over five years trailed the S&P. It's hard to count him out, though (50 years is a pretty damned good track record, and it's not like there's a comparable group that's been investing over a period of time to which compare because many of them are probably dead). His acquisition strategy is laid out in a Berkshire regulatory filing this year that says, "Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management." That's part of it, but some of it is also that he's usually getting into businesses that are embedded like a tick in the American landscape. Heinz is the very definition of ketchup; BNSF is the largest operator of U.S. rails, Geico recently became the second-largest car insurer in America; Lubrizol, another Buffett holding, was the top performing chemical company among Fortune 500 companies in 2010, based on earnings per share and total shareholder return. He is a big holder of Coca-Cola Co <KO.N> and IBM <IBM.N>, which, well, y'know. Trying to figure out who might be next on his list is a tricky one. A screen of companies with a low P/E, high return on equity and low debt-to-capital ratios (about 25 percent) yields only a handful of names, and most of them are pretty small. That's not to say smaller companies aren't something he'd like, but they'd better have a market-leading position. Still, Buffett's boosterism of the United States, which he highlighted a few years back, comes at a time when capital expenditures are starting to rise and strategists have noted rising bank loans to smaller companies as well.
