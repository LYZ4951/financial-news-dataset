SEOUL, May 2 (Reuters) - Lotte Shopping Co Ltd <023530.KS>, South Korea's largest department store chain owner, said on Friday it is postponing the listing of an up to $1 billion real estate investment trust (REIT) in Singapore.

The company said in a regulatory filing it could consider the option again if global financial market conditions improve in the future, but is currently considering a sale & lease back deal through a local public real estate fund as an alternative.
