May 2 (Reuters) - The CME Group <CME.O> halted trading in some Treasuries futures contracts on Friday immediately after the highly anticipated U.S. jobs report for April was released.

CME halted trading in 5-year Treasury futures for 10 seconds, Reuters data shows, disrupting one of the world's biggest marketplaces where investors bet on and hedge against bond-market swings. Reuters data shows trading stopped at 8:30:04 a.m., immediately after the data was released, and resumed at 8:30:15 a.m.  CME spokespeople did not immediately respond for comment.
