May 2 (Reuters) - Banks in the euro area will borrow heavily once again at the European Central Bank's weekly refinancing operation amid tight money market conditions, a Reuters Poll showed on Friday.

The poll of 23 money market traders found banks will take 140.0 billion euros ($194.1 billion) at the ECB's one-week tender.  Although that consensus is lower than the 172.6 billion euros banks took on Wednesday, it would be significantly higher than the average of 104.5 billion euros banks have been borrowing over the last two months. Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> fell below 100 billion euros for the first time since September 2011 last week. While that did not result in a spike in the EONIA rate <EONIA=>, banks are expected to borrow heavily from the ECB to meet their liquidity requirements.  Friday's poll also showed banks will repay 6 billion euros of the ECB's two long-term crisis loans in the week of May 12, more than the 1.75 billion euros they are expected to return on May 7. ----------------------------------------------------------------   ALLOTMENT ONE-WEEK ---------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN140.0  MEAN  138.6 MODE  140.0  HIGHEST   180.0LOWEST 98.0 COUNT   23 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   THREE-YEAR LTRO REPAYMENTS   FIRST LTRO  SECOND LTRO   ----------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN 3.0   3.0MEAN   3.3   2.8MODE   5.0   3.0HIGHEST6.0   5.0LOWEST 0.3   0.3COUNT   2222   ----------------------------------------------------------------  GUIDE TO EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCEMENTS <ECBMENU> ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ECB OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS <ECB15>
