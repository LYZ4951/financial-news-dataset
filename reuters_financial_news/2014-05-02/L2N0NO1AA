NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories <ABT.N> is considering selling a big chunk of its mature drugs, people familiar with the matter said, joining a list of large drugmakers seeking to sell their older products in an effort to focus on high-growth areas.

Abbott's portfolio of mature drugs being reviewed for sale has around $2 billion in annual revenue and could fetch more than $5 billion, the people said. The U.S. drugmaker is working with Morgan Stanley <MS.N> to find a buyer for the off-patent, or established products, the people added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Abbott and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Abbott has a big lineup of established pharmaceuticals, whose sales fell 3 percent last year to $4.97 billion. Analysts have been grumbling for the past year about the performance of the business, which has dragged down overall company results.
