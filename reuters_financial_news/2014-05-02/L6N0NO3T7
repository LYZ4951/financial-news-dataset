ABIDJAN, May 2 (Reuters) - West Africa's regional BRVM bourse closes lower in the week to Friday, weighed down by Burkina Faso telecoms Onatel <ONTBF.C> and Senegalese heavyweight Sonatel <SNTS.CI>.

The all-share index BRVMCI declines 4.65 percent to 229.85 points on turnover of 6.18 billion CFA francs ($13.06 million)in the four sessions, sharply up from 943.8 million CFA francs in four sessions last week. The bourse was closed on Thursday because of a national holiday.  Onatel falls 1,260 CFA francs, or more than 13 percent, to finish at 8,200 CFA francs, while Sonatel sheds 500 CFA francs, or more than 2 percent, to close at 22,000 CFA francs, both on profit-taking, traders say.
