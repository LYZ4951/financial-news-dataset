LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> said it does not intend to settle early with investors who claim they were misled over its 12 billion pound ($20.27 billion) rights issue six years ago and are suing it for billions of pounds.

Hundreds of investors, including some of the bank's biggest institutional investors, claim they were misled by RBS over its massive rights issue in 2008, raising the prospect of a high profile fight in court next year. [ID:nL6N0NH3KQ]
