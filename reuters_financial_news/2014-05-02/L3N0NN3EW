May 2 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc's <TWTR.N> six-month lock-up period is set to expire on May 5, removing restrictions on the sale of about 470 million shares, or roughly 82 percent of its outstanding shares.

Twitter's co-founders and an investor, together holding about 109 million shares, have said they would not sell their stake immediately after the expiry of the lock-up. "Despite some key investor and executive statements that they will not sell near term, we estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of shares could be unlocked," JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a research note on April 30.
