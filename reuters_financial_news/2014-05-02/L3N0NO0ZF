SINGAPORE, May 2 (Reuters) - Singapore shares edged down on Friday on the back of a muted performance on Wall Street and uninspiring China manufacturing data, while the broader Asian market fared slightly better.

The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> fell 0.4 percent to 3,252.05, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.4 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd <HKLD.SI> led losses on the index, plunging 4.1 percent to an intra-day low of $6.71, its lowest in three weeks. Record first-quarter earnings on Wednesday from Singapore's three banks were also cited by analysts as a cue for investors to book their profits at the end of the week. [ID:nL3N0NM1CW] "I guess the market is taking some profits off the table, especially after we've had a pretty good run on Wednesday," said Carey Wong, an analyst at OCBC Investment Research. Among other stocks, shares of SMRT Ltd <SMRT.SI> rose as much as 2.9 percent after the transport operator reported a rise in its fourth-quarter net profit from a year earlier. [ID:nSNZ61kQnQ]
