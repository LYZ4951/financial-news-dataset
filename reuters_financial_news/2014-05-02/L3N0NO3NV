May 2 (Reuters) - Sport shoes maker Skechers USA Inc <SKX.N> said on Friday it will explore buying a stake in the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, whose owner is at the center of a controversy over alleged racist remarks.

The commissioner of the National Basketball Association has banned team owner Donald Sterling for life over the alleged comments, raising the likelihood that the team will be sold.
