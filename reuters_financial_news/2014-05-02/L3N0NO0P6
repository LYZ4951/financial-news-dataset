SEOUL, May 2 (Reuters) - Seoul shares inched down on Friday and for the week as foreign investors' net selling extended into a fourth session ahead of key U.S. jobs data and a four-day weekend, while the won <KRW=> inched up to finish the week stronger.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.1 percent at 1,959.44 points, extending its losing skid to a seventh session. The index slipped 0.6 percent for the week. Foreign investors sold a net 150 billion won ($145 million) worth of KOSPI shares, bringing their net selling to 507.8 billion Korean won during a four-day selloff.

On a weekly basis, the won rose 1.1 percent after two straight weeks of weekly declines.
