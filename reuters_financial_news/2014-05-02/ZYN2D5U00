FRANKFURT, May 2 (Reuters) - Banks will return 1.75 billion euros ($2.43 billion) in long-term crisis loans to the European Central Bank next week, far less than expected amid tight money market conditions.

The amount banks will repay on May 7 is less than this week's repayments of 9.579 billion euros, and below the 6.5 billion forecast in a Reuters poll. [ECB/REFI] Banks are voluntarily offloading the crisis loans they took from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012 in anticipation of Europe-wide bank stress tests, which will over the next couple of months check how the lenders hold up under certain scenarios. The tests are part of a broader balance sheet review done by ECB before it takes over as bank supervisor in November. Tightness in money markets, along with a fall in euro zone lending and weaker-than-expected German inflation, has compounded the European Central Bank's policy conundrum in the run-up to its meeting next week. [ID:nL6N0NL54G] Euro zone banks repaid on average 10.5 billion euros per week in March and 7.6 billion on average in April.   The pace has slowed somewhat as the level of liquidity in the system beyond what banks need for their day-to-day operations reached critical levels. On Friday, the ECB said two banks would repay 1.3 billion euros from the first LTRO on May 7, and three banks would pay back 0.450 billion from the second LTRO.
