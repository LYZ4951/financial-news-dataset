LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's debt insurance costs rose and its dollar bonds fell on Friday on mounting tensions in the conflict with Russia.

Pro-Russian rebels shot down two Ukrainian helicopters on Friday, killing two crew, as troops tightened their siege of separatist-held Slaviansk.  [ID:nL6N0NO1R6] Russia was calling for a U.N. Security Council meeting following Ukraine's attack on Slaviansk, a news agency quoted the Russian mission as saying. [ID:nL6N0NO2UB] Ukraine's 5-year credit default swaps rose 54 basis points from Thursday's close to a 2-1/2-month high of 1,244 bps, according to Markit. Ukraine's dollar bonds fell 1-2 cents on the dollar <XS091760584=TE> <XS045920712=TE> to six-week lows, according to Tradeweb. Russia's CDS also rose 18 bps to 278 bps, a one-week high.
