TOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - Japanese shares stepped back on Friday, with Sony Corp. <6758.T> falling after a profit warning and as investors took a wait-and-see stance ahead of a closely-watched U.S. employment report later in the day.

The Nikkei share average <.N225> ticked down 0.2 percent to 14,457.51, halting a recovery from Monday's low of 14,224.47, hampered by resistance around 14,500 - 14,600.
