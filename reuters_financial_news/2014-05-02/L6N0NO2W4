ZURICH, May 2 (Reuters) - Switzerland's Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf is meeting Eric Holder, Attorney General of the United States, in Washington on Friday to discuss a tax-evasion probe into Swiss banks by U.S. authorities, a ministry spokesman said.

Contacted by phone, the spokesman said Widmer-Schlumpf would push for "fair and equal treatment" of the Swiss banks involved in the probe. Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX>, the biggest Swiss bank in the probe, came under more pressure this week as one of its former employees pleaded guilty to helping U.S. clients avoid taxes. [ID:nL2N0NM22B] [ID:nL6N0MZ1SK] "The United States Department of Justice's investigation into the U.S. tax matter remains outstanding and, while we are working hard to bring this to a close, the timing and outcome remain uncertain," Credit Suisse said in its quarterly report published on Friday. The bank declined to comment further on the minister's talks. More than a dozen Swiss banks, also including Julius Baer <BAER.VX> and the Swiss arm of Britain's HSBC <HSBA.L>, are under criminal investigation in the United States to determine if and how they helped wealthy Americans hide money from the taxman.
