May 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The removal of adverse consumer credit information from  South African credit bureau records will increase credit risk, although this is  mitigated as all lenders will still have access to borrowers' payment histories,  while banks can keep and use their own existing records, Fitch Ratings says.  The increased risk should therefore remain manageable, although it may push up  the price of consumer credit. Eventually, the measures may reduce competition in  the South African banking market.  Under regulations that took effect at the beginning of last month, a registered  credit bureau must remove adverse consumer credit information within two months  of April 1 2014. This includes "subjective classifications of consumer  behaviour? such as 'delinquent', 'default', 'slow paying', 'absconded' or 'not  contactable'," and "adverse classifications of enforcement action" by lenders,  as well as details of disputes lodged by borrowers.  Information relating to  paid up judgements must be removed continuously. No lender will be able to use  the removed information for any reason, including credit scoring and assessment.  The government has stressed that the regulations are not a credit amnesty and  that it is concerned about wider problems where an adverse credit history  restricts opportunities, such as employment or rental accommodation.  Credit bureaus can keep, and all lenders will still be able to refer to,  borrowers' payment histories under the regulations. The banks' internal credit  information on past and existing customers will also remain unaffected and  available for use. This will limit the regulations' impact on banks' ability to  perform credit assessments, as we anticipated when the regulations were first  proposed last year.  However, the removal and restriction on use of adverse credit information will  increase risk in the system as lenders lose more detailed information on why  payments were not made. The additional risk will depend on how accurately  historical borrower delinquencies can be inferred from the borrowers' payment  history. Credit scoring models may have to be redesigned, and may become less  effective at identifying good and bad credit risks, depending on the extent to  which they incorporate adverse credit information. This will vary from bank to  bank, but may increase the overall price of consumer credit, also in line with  our initial assessment.  The impact will be greater for credit products where large-scale lending  decisions are largely based on model results such as unsecured consumer loans,  auto loans and, to a lesser extent, residential mortgages.  In the long term, the regulations could limit competition in the South African  banking sector, as potential new entrants would not have access to adverse  credit information via credit bureaux. The strict enforcement of the regulations  may be a source of conduct risk for lenders.  Overall, we think the increase in credit risk is manageable for South African  banks, and the regulations do not have rating implications for the sector. For  securitisation, we also do not expect a direct impact for existing mortgage and  auto loan securitisation platforms, and we do not currently rate South African  structured finance transactions backed by unsecured loans, which may see a  bigger impact.
