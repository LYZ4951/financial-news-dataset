BOSTON, May 1 (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings extended this year's strong gains with a 7.6 percent jump in April, leaving it up 20 percent for the year, three sources said on Thursday.

A large part of April's gains were driven by pharmaceutical company Allergan Inc <AGN.N>, whose stock rallied 36 percent in the wake of news that Pershing Square had acquired a 10 percent stake and is working with pharmaceutical company Valeant <VRX.TO> to buy the Botox-maker.
