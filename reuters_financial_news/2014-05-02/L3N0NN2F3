May 2 (Reuters) - Direct Line Insurance Group Plc <DLGD.L>, Britain's largest car insurer, posted a 5.6 percent decline in first-quarter gross written premium, as it grappled with tough competition in the UK motor and home insurance markets.

The company, which also offers home, travel and pet cover, said it would target margins at the expense of policy volumes. [ID:nRSB1333Ga]
