NAIROBI, July 17 (Reuters) - Kenya's state pension fund expects annual contributions from members to rise to 118 billion shillings ($1.35 billion) in five years from 8 billion shillings now and will invest the cash in new asset classes like private equity, its chief executive said.

Richard Langat, the chief executive of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), told Reuters the annual contributions  would rise to 12 percent of gross monthly earnings, split evenly between employee and employer, up from just 1 percent now. The move will help Kenya catch up with other east African nations which have proven better at gathering savings for retirement. Higher contributions to the fund, now worth about 160 billion shillings, could also generate more domestic resources to fund new infrastructure and other major projects.  "We are making Kenyans save for their future," Langat said in an interview on Wednesday. "We are poor savers as Kenyans. We are a consumer economy." The contributions increase, which has been challenged in court by some trade unions, would be implemented gradually over the five years to 2018/19, Langat said. The first increment, which kicks in this financial year of 2014/15, was expected to increase total annual contributions to 23 billion shillings from the current level of about 8 billion shillings, he said, rising to 118 billion shillings by 2018/19. Kenya's financial year runs from July 1 to June 30. Seeking to allay fears the fund would saturate Kenya's bourse, which has a market capitalisation of 2.1 trillion shillings, he said NSSF would look for new investment avenues.  "We have fund managers who will be scouting for investment opportunities including private equity, offshore investments," Langat said. The aim was to diversify from its present focus on real estate, listed firms, government and corporate debt as well as cash deposits with financial institutions, he added.  NSSF would also invest some funds in the government's mega-infrastructure projects, such as the construction of a new seaport in Lamu on the north coast and a new rail network. "That is where NSSF would like to invest," he said.   PENSIONS CATCH-UP The higher contributions were part of a new law enacted last year to boost savings in Kenya, which has lagged others in the region in mobilising pension contributions, he said. "Kenya will be doing catch-up," he said, citing neighbouring Uganda where the pension contribution now stands at 15 percent of gross monthly salary - 5 percent contributed by the employee and 10 percent by the employer. Only about 2 million Kenyans, out of an eligible population of 12.5 million workers in the formal and informal sectors, are members of a pension scheme, with 1.7 million contributing to the NSSF and the rest to private schemes, Langat said. "We are targeting to grow (NSSF membership) to 3.8 million in the next five years," the chief executive said. In the past, the CEO was appointed by the labour minister, fuelling accusations that politics rather than sound strategy often drove investments. For example, critics complained that the fund sometimes bought land at inflated prices, benefiting the seller at the expense of the fund contributors.  Under the new law, the CEO will be picked by the board, which includes labour union and employer representatives, as well as the government. The NSSF will also hold an annual meeting to enhance transparency. The first will be in September. Other reforms already implemented include a decision to outsource fund management to six private firms in 2011. That change boosted annual returns to 17-20 percent from single digits previously, helping increase the total size of the fund to 160 billion shillings last month from 134 billion shillings in June last year, Langat said.
