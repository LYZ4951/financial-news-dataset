STOCKHOLM, July 17 (Reuters) - Sweden's Handelsbanken <SHBa.ST> reported on Thursday second-quarter operating profit above expectations thanks to lower loan losses and a boost from dividend income.

Operating profit in the quarter rose to 5.1 billion Swedish crowns ($747 million), beating a mean forecast for 4.8 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts and compared with 4.7 billion in the year-earlier period.
