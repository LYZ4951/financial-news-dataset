LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Russian sovereign dollar bonds slumped on Thursday to multi-week lows after the United States slapped its most wide-ranging sanctions yet on Russia's economy, hitting major state-run companies and bank.

Russia's most traded 2030 bond <XS011428878=TE> fell 1.5 cents to trade at 113.7 cents in the dollar, the lowest since early May while the 2020 issue touched a one-month low <XS050495434=TE>. Russian bond yield spreads on the EMBI Global, a measure of the premium investors demand to hold Russian debt compared to underlying U.S. Treasuries, widened 20 basis points to 261 bps <11EML> "This represents a seismic hit to Russia, and to Russian markets," Standard Bank analyst Tim Ash said of the sanctions.
