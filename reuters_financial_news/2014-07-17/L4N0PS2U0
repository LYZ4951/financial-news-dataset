July 17 (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc <UNH.N>, the largest U.S. health insurer, reported a 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue, helped by the addition of 270,000 members to its healthcare plans and strong growth in its Optum pharmacy services division.

Net income was $1.41 billion, or $1.42 per share, in the second-quarter ended June 30, compared to $1.44 billion, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier. [ID:nBw4XMwzxa]
