LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Thursday it would consult all of its shareholders on the implications of the European Union's call for it to suspend new lending in Russia.

In Brussels on Wednesday EU leaders said they would expand sanctions against Russia to target companies that undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and ask the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to suspend new lending. "We note the decision of the EU Council in Brussels concerning our activities in Russia and will now be consulting all of our shareholders on the implications," said the EBRD's Director of Communications, Jonathan Charles. While the large number of former Soviet countries that are EBRD shareholders may make it difficult to secure a formal suspension of lending in Russia, the U.S. and EU would have a majority meaning they could effectively block all projects. Russia has traditionally been the biggest recipient of the London-based EBRD's funds - it lent 1.8 billion euros ($2.46 billion) there last year. The EIB pledged to lend more than 1 billion euros to Russia last year.
