July 17 (Reuters) - South Korean shares rose to more than a seven-month closing high on Thursday, boosted by foreign inflows, while won gains were capped amid ongoing speculation of a rate cut.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> finished at 2,020.90, up 0.37 percent from Wednesday's domestic close at 2,013.48. It was the highest closing level since Dec. 2, 2013. Offshore investors bought a net 226 billion won ($219.59 million) worth of KOSPI shares, while institutions and retail investors sold a net 116 billion won ($112.7 million) and 111 billion won ($107.9 million), respectively. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,029.1 against the dollar at the domestic close, up 0.29 percent from Wednesday's onshore close at 1,032.1. The chairman of the finance committee called for a 50-basis- point cut in interest rates at the National Assembly meeting on Thursday, weakening the won.
