July 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley's <MS.N> quarterly adjusted earnings more than doubled as stronger performances by its investment banking and wealth management businesses more than made up for a fall in revenue from bond trading.

Net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $1.86 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the three months to June 30 from $802 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. [ID:nBwbVS7Fha]
