CAIRO, July 17 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> remained stable at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday and on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $37.4 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, the same as its last sale on Wednesday. The bank's rates have stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after it had allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.43 pounds, one market participant said, the same rate as the day before.
