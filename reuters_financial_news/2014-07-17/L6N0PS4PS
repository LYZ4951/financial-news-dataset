LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - UK hospital group Spire Healthcare [IPO-SPIR.L] is set to price its London stock market debut at 210 pence a share, the bottom of the range and valuing the firm at 842 million pounds ($1.4 billion), two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Spire, which is owned by European private equity firm Cinven [CINV.UL], had set the original price range at 210-300 pence a share, later narrowed to 210-220 pence, as it seeks to raise gross proceeds of 315 million pounds through the sale of new shares.
