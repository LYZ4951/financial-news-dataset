July 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Korea-based Doosan  Infracore Co., Ltd.'s <042670.KS> (DI) USD500m capital securities at 'A-'. The rating reflects the credit enhancement provided to investors by the credit  facility provider (CFP) banks.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Credit Enhancement by Banks: The rating reflects the credit enhancement provided  to investors by Korea Development Bank [KDB.UL] (AA-/Stable), Woori Bank [WOORIA.UL] (A-/Stable) and Hana Bank [SEOULB.UL](A-/Stable). Investors in the securities are granted the right to put  the securities to Core Partners Limited, a special purpose company unrelated to  DI. The abovementioned banks provide a five-year irrevocable and unconditional  commitment via a credit agreement to lend Core Partners an amount sufficient to  meet its put obligations. This amount includes the then outstanding principal  and any accumulated distribution payments. Put Option: Investors can exercise the put option if DI fails to redeem the  securities at the end of the fifth year (2017), when the distribution rate steps  up by 500 basis points. Investors also have the right to exercise the put option  in a number of other instances prior to the fifth year, including the bankruptcy  of DI. Fitch's Rating Assumptions: In rating the securities, Fitch has taken the view  that investors will exercise the put option at the end of the fifth year (2017)  if DI chooses not to redeem the securities. As a result, the rating reflects the  banks' commitment to fund Core Partners to meet its obligations to the  investors. However, the rating is capped at the lowest of Fitch's assessments of  the banks due to the several but not joint obligations of the banks under the  credit agreement. Any change in the lowest of Fitch's assessments of the banks  will result in an equivalent change to the instrument rating.DI's Credit Not Considered: DI's standalone credit strength is not a  consideration in the instrument rating as the credit agreement remains in force  even if DI is declared bankrupt. However, DI may elect to defer distribution  payments during the credit agreement period without triggering the put option.  Investors will receive any deferred distributions only upon the exercise of the  put option.
