LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - The following are outstanding syndicated loans and selected hard-currency bonds issued by Russian energy companies Rosneft <ROSN.MM> and Novatek <NVTK.MM> and banks Gazprombank <GZPRI.RTS> and VEB, on which the United States imposed sanctions on Wednesday.

The sanctions effectively close access for the four firms to new medium- and long-term dollar funding. [ID:nL6N0PS1PZ] The oustanding loans, many of which were taken from syndicates involving U.S. banks, together amount to $32.29 billion. The bonds listed are those maturing in the next two years.
