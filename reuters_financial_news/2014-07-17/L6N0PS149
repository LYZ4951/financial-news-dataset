FRANKFURT, July 17 (Reuters) - German engineering group Siemens <SIEGn.DE> agreed to sell its clinical microbiology business to Beckman Coulter [DHRBE.UL], a subsidiary of Danaher Corp <DHR.N>, as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve profitability.

Siemens, which did not disclose financial details of the deal, said the move allowed it to focus its healthcare division more on its in-vitro business.
