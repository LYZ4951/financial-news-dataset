LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Investment funds focused on emerging economies or high-yield debt may be unable to return investors' money promptly if turmoil hits markets, potentially causing major disruption, a top Bank of England official warned on Thursday.

Many investment funds promise to redeem investors' shares within a day or two. But BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said this may not be realistic when trouble strikes less liquid markets and droves of investors want to cut their losses.
