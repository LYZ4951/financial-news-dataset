NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped on Thursday to hit session lows on news that a Malaysian passenger jetliner had been downed in Ukraine, fresh on the heels of new U.S. and European Union sanctions on Russia.

A Malaysian airplane failed to enter Russian airspace when expected on Thursday and was found burning on the ground in eastern Ukraine, an aviation source told Reuters. [ID:nL6N0PS5CC] "Clearly there is a lot of speculation, there are even videos surfacing on YouTube and the market is quite sensitive to things it can only verify by Twitter," said Joseph Greco, managing director at Meridian Equity Partners in New York.  "President Obama had some words about sanctions and as you know, that is going to be a bit of an issue."  The iShares China Large Cap ETF <FXI.P> lost 0.8 percent. The NYSEArce airline index <.XAL> was down 1.6 percent.  The U.S. sanctions announced late Wednesday hit some of Russia's biggest firms while the EU sanctions were aimed at Russian companies that help destabilize Ukraine and will block new loans to Russia through two multilateral lenders. The Market Vectors Russia ETF <RSX.P> dropped 5.5 percent. [ID:nL6N0PS1PZ] [ID:nL6N0PR2EQ] Equities had been holding near the unchanged mark earlier in the session, largely on the back of solid earnings from companies such as Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, which was down 0.1 percent at $32.46, and UnitedHealth <UNH.N>, up 3.4 percent at $86.62. [ID:nL4N0PS37M] [ID:nL4N0PS2XQ] Microsoft <MSFT.O> shares rose 2.9 percent to $45.34 after the company said it would cut up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, resulting in pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four quarters.
