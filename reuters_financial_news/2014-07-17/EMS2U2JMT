NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended July 16 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $13.5 billion to $1.028 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $8.4 billion to $1.047 trillion.
