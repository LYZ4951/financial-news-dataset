MUMBAI, July 17 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose for a third straight session on Thursday as lenders such as Kotak Mahindra Bank <KTKM.NS> extended gains on earnings, and on upbeat sentiment as the central bank exempted long-term bonds for the infrastructure sector from reserve requirements.

Kotak Mahindra Bank provisionally rose 3.8 percent while State Bank of India <SBI.NS> ended up 1 percent.
