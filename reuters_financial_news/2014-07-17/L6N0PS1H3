DUBAI, July 17 (Reuters) - Trade in shares of Dubai construction firm Arabtec <ARTC.DU> were suspended from the opening on Thursday pending clarification of media reports on possible investment in its shares, a bourse spokesman said.

Arabtec shares, the most heavily traded on the bourse, have risen sharply this week on speculation that Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments, a big shareholder, may further raise its stake from the current 18.94 percent.
