July 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in its 2014 Mid-year Sovereign Review  and Outlook report that a stabilisation in the eurozone has supported an  improving trend in global sovereign rating actions and a rebalancing towards  fewer Negative Outlooks in 1H14, indicating that downward pressure on sovereign  creditworthiness has reduced.   This improving trend reflects principally the stabilisation and improvement of  sovereign ratings and Outlooks in the developed market (DM) economies, in  particular the eurozone. 1H14 saw upgrades for both Spain (to BBB+/Stable) and  Greece (to B/Stable), reflecting improvements in the fiscal positions and  macroeconomic performance of the peripheral eurozone countries as they continue  to recover from deep recessions. Positive Outlook revisions on the ratings of  Italy, Cyprus and Portugal (the latter from Negative to Positive at BB+) and  very recently on the Netherlands underscore the stabilisation of eurozone  sovereign creditworthiness over the past six months. For the first time since  2009, no eurozone countries are on Negative Outlook. In contrast, the net upward momentum in emerging market (EM) sovereign ratings  since 2010 has stalled, extending a trend observed in 2013, as many face more  challenging growth conditions, difficult policy trade-offs and political or  geopolitical pressures. This represents further evidence that the secular trend  of convergence in the ratings of DM and EM sovereigns is starting to reverse.  The balance of DM and EM Outlooks suggests this reversal will continue in 2H14  and 2015. Negative Outlooks on DM sovereigns are now outnumbered by those on  Positive (three to two), while EMs exhibit a heavily negative balance, with 12  on Negative Outlook and only five on Positive. Fitch forecasts global economic growth to accelerate gradually to 2.7% in 2014  and 3.1% in 2015 and 2016, from 2.4% in 2013. Growth will largely result from a  firmer and more balanced recovery across DMs, although weak world trade and  higher oil prices add to risks. We forecast growth in EMs at 4.3% in 2014, 4.8%  in 2015 and 4.9% in 2016, down from 4.7% in 2013, reflecting constraints from  infrastructure bottlenecks, weak business environments and unbalanced growth  that have reduced medium-term growth potential in many countries. Fitch expects the Fed and the Bank of England to start gradually tightening  policy over the next 12 months. Normalising monetary conditions after over five  years of virtually zero interest rates and unwinding inflated central bank  balance sheets is historically unprecedented and may trigger some increase in  financial market volatility, albeit from very low levels. This will also create  divergence with the ECB and the Bank of Japan, which are still loosening policy  and are likely to keep interest rates unchanged until at least 2016. Following the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Federation in 1Q14, the  Russia/Ukraine crisis remains unresolved, although the near-term macroeconomic  implications are manageable for the global economy. More recently, intensifying  insurgency in Iraq has potentially widespread but uncertain implications  throughout the region and beyond, due to the impact on Sunni/Shia tensions and  the role of key players such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the US. Although macroeconomic volatility has reduced since the global financial crisis,  medium- to long-term growth rates are likely to come under downward pressure  from a combination of weaker productivity growth and negative demographics  stemming from ageing populations. These trends are likely to affect both DMs and  EMs, although if current trends are maintained, the impact will be felt more  acutely in DMs.
