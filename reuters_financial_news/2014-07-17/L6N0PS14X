DUBAI, July 17 (Reuters) - Dubai's bourse may continue rising on Thursday after its rally became more broad-based in the previous session and volumes remained strong, but the latest round of second-quarter earnings reports across the Gulf has been mixed.

The Dubai index <.DFMGI> rose 1.9 percent on Wednesday. Builder Arabtec <ARTC.DU> rose the same amount and again dominated trading, but some other Dubai stocks also attracted heavy retail investor interest; bourse operator Dubai Financial Market <DFM.DU> jumped 5.5 percent and conglomerate Dubai Investments <DINV.DU> was up 5.0 percent. DFM is expected to publish its second-quarter earnings after trading closes on Thursday, and the stock could gain further on hopes for positive results. Abu Dhabi's Dana Gas <DANA.AD> could weaken, however, after Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region on Wednesday rejected a statement by the firm that a London tribunal had awarded the company the right to receive some outstanding payments from the Kurdish government. [ID:nL6N0PR422] In Qatar, Doha Bank <DOBK.QA> jumped 4.2 percent on Wednesday before publishing its quarterly earnings, but its profit rose in line with analysts' forecasts and may disappoint investors who had bet on a positive surprise. [ID:nL6N0PS0UE] Saudi food producer Savola Group <2050.SE> may gain after it reported a higher than expected 32.4 percent jump in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday. [ID:nL6N0PR3Y1]
