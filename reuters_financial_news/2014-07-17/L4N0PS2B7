SHANGHAI, July 17 (Reuters) - China's Jiangsu province will issue a total of 17.4 billion yuan ($2.80 billion) of five-, seven- and 10-year municipal bonds on July 24.

The proceeds will be used to support public projects such as the rebuilding of substandard housing and the construction of roads, the Shandong government said in the bond prospectus published on a website for major Chinese bond issues (www.chinabond.com.cn). Jiangsu province is the third local government to issue municipal bonds after Guangdong and Shandong.[ID:nL4N0P40FY][ID:nB9N0OL00K] The Ministry of Finance said in late May that 10 local governments had been given quotas to issue a combined 109.2 billion yuan ($17.60 billion) of municipal bonds this year.
