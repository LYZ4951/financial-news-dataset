July 17 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Sycamore Partners is in talks with regional discount store operator Fred's Inc <FRED.O> about a potential takeover, according to people familiar with the matter.

The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Sycamore declined to comment. Fred's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
