MADRID, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. investment fund Blackstone <BX.N> paid 3.615 billion euros ($5 billion) for a portfolio of home loans belonging to Spain's bailed-out Catalunya Banc, the lender said on Thursday, confirming an earlier Reuters story. [ID:nL6N0PR5B5]

Spain's bank restructuring fund, the FROB, put 572 million euros towards the deal, Catalunya Banc said. The government hopes the sale of the huge portfolio will slim down the bank and make it more attractive to buyers.
