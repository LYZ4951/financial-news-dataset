HONG KONG, July 17 (Reuters) - China shares declined on Thursday as investors moved out of recent outperforming blue chips to keep money aside for new initial public offerings, with property developers and carmakers leading losses.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.6 percent at 2,055.59 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also fell 0.6 percent. Property developers were broadly weaker ahead of the release of June home price data on Friday. China Vanke <000002.SZ> shed 1 percent and Poly Real Estate <600048.SS> 0.2 percent. SAIC Motor <600104.SS> sank 2.4 percent, after lingering around its 7-month high for three days.
