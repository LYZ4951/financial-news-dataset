BEIJING, July 17 (Reuters) - China is allowing banks to extend new loans to small companies so they can repay old debts, according to a government document seen by Reuters on Thursday, in an apparent move to throw a lifeline to cash-strapped firms.

Issued by the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the circular said small- to micro-sized firms that are financially sound, operating normally and have never given inaccurate information about how they planned to use their loans may be eligible. Analysts said the programme did not amount to allowing companies to roll over their loans as companies that qualify do not have to pay higher interest rates as is often the case when loans are rolled over. The bank regulator was not immediately available for comment. Banks will also be encouraged to develop new loan products tailored to the needs of smaller firms, such as allowing loans to be repaid in instalments, the notice said. The move is one of a series of measures undertaken in recent months to help channel credit to smaller firms and the farm sector, part of efforts to shore up the economy. Other measures include cutting the reserve requirement ratio for selected banks that have focused their lending on small companies and agricultural projects, and the launch of a "re-lending" programme that pumps more money into the two sectors.
