NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday in volatile trading on news that a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet crashed near the Ukraine-Russia border, after the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia.

Investors sold equities in a move to avoid risk because of conflicting reports about the reason why the plane went down. A New York Stock Exchange floor trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited reports that the plane might been shot down. "What's happening in the market is what you'd expect, a risk reversal. Stocks fall a bit, gold rises a bit, energy prices are still high, the volatility index spikes," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> surged 17.6 percent to 12.94 and was on track to post its biggest daily percentage gain in at least three months. Spot gold <XAU=> rose 1.4 percent to above $1,315 an ounce and U.S. crude <CLc1> shot up 1.8 percent to $103.03 a barrel. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 89.26 points or 0.52 percent, to 17,048.94. The S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 14.37 points or 0.73 percent, to 1,967.20. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 40.89 points or 0.92 percent, to 4,385.08. The major U.S. stock indexes opened modestly lower following news of fresh U.S. and European Union sanctions on Russia. Stronger-than-expected earnings, however, helped curb the declines. By late morning, stocks slid to session lows after news that a Malaysian airliner was brought down over eastern Ukraine on Thursday. The crash killed all 295 people aboard and sharply increased the stakes in a conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow rebels in which Russia and the West back opposing sides. [ID:nL6N0PS6BC] Ukraine accused "terrorists" - militants fighting to unite eastern Ukraine with Russia - of shooting down the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with a heavy Soviet-era ground-to-air missile as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. "If there's an escalation here and we go to Tier Three sanctions, think about the economic effect it has on Russia and its trading partners," Hogan said. "If sanctions become harsh enough and have enough economic impact on Russia, it could drag the core of Europe into a recession. That's the economic possibility." The iShares China Large Cap ETF <FXI.P> slipped 1.1 percent. The NYSE Arca airline index <.XAL> was down 1.6 percent.  The U.S. sanctions, which were announced late on Wednesday, hit some of Russia's biggest companies while the EU sanctions were aimed at Russian companies that help destabilize Ukraine and will block new loans to Russia through two multilateral lenders. The Market Vectors Russia ETF <RSX.P> lost 6.4 percent. [ID:nL6N0PS1PZ] [ID:nL6N0PR2EQ] Equities had been holding near the unchanged mark earlier in the session, largely on the back of solid earnings from companies such as Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, down 0.2 percent at $32.44, and UnitedHealth <UNH.N>, up 2.4 percent at $85.77. [ID:nL4N0PS37M] [ID:nL4N0PS2XQ] Microsoft <MSFT.O> shares rose 1.3 percent to $44.64 after the company said it would cut up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, resulting in pre-tax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four quarters. [ID:nL2N0PS0J5] Data on manufacturing and the labor market indicated that the U.S. economy was improving, although the housing market remains weak. The PHLX housing index <.HGX> fell 1.6 percent.For Market Pulse:  [WATCH/US]  For running updates on what's moving U.S. stocks: [STXNEWS/US] ==============================================================  For other U.S. market data and news:   U.S. Equities speed guide........................<US/EQUITY>   S&P 500 index ........................................<.SPX>   Dow Jones industrial average..........................<.DJI>   Nasdaq Composite index...............................<.IXIC>   Nasdaq 100............................................<.NDX>   Thomson Reuters US Index .......................<.TRXFLDUSP>  Russell 2000 small cap................................<.RUT>   S&P major sectors..............................<0#.GSPMAJOR>   NYSE most active.....................................<.AV.N>   Nasdaq most active...................................<.AV.O>   Top NYSE pct gainers.................................<.PG.N>   Top NYSE pct losers..................................<.PL.N>   Top Nasdaq pct gainers...............................<.PG.O>   Top Nasdaq pct losers................................<.PL.O>   52 week highs:  NYSE...............<t.YH.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YH.O>   52 week lows:  NYSE...............<t.YL.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YL.O>Main global stock indexes and market reports:   FTSE Eurotop 300 .....<.FTEU3>  European report .......[.EU]   Nikkei 225.............<.N225>  Tokyo report............[.T]   FTSE 100...............<.FTSE>  London report...........[.L]   Xetra DAX.............<.GDAXI>  Frankfurt market stories[.F]   CAC-40.................<.FCHI>  Paris market stories...[.PA]   World Indices.....................................<0#.INDEX>   Reuters survey of world bourse outlook.........<EQUITYPOLL1>   U.S. IPO diary........................................[IPO/]   U.S. Asset Allocation Table.......................[US/ASSET] More Reuters News on equities at a glance:   Equities ............[E]   US company news.........[TOP/EQU]Key non-equities market reports:   Foreign exchange......................................[FRX/]   Oil....................................................[O/R]   US Treasuries.........................................[US/N]   International bonds...................................[EUB/]   Gold.......................................[GOL/X] or [GOL/]   ))  Keywords: MARKETS USA STOCKS
