July 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hiscox Ltd's <HSX.L> (Hiscox) group  core entities' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings at 'A+'. Fitch has also  affirmed the Long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of all Hiscox's holding  companies at 'A-'. The Outlooks on all ratings are Stable. A full list of rating  actions is at the end of this comment.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects Hiscox's robust risk-adjusted capitalisation and  expectations of an on-going sound record of profitability supported by  well-diversified business activities. The ratings remain constrained by the  moderate scale of the company.  Hiscox's core entities' ratings are supported by the group's strong  risk-adjusted capitalisation, reinforced by strong retained earnings. Based on  Fitch's internal assessment, Hiscox's risk-adjusted capitalisation remains  comfortably supportive of its current ratings.  The ratings are further supported by Hiscox's strong track record of  underwriting profitability. In 2013, Hiscox's Fitch-calculated combined ratio  remained strong at 80.4% (2012: 84.1%), which compared favourably with peers.  Fitch expects the company to report a strong profit for 1H14, given the  relatively benign weather to date. The historical stability of Hiscox's  technical performance, reflected in a five-year average combined ratio of 87.2%,  has been aided by a diversified business mix, combining both volatile and more  stable lines of business.  Reserve releases are expected to continue to support results. Hiscox's reserve  releases have been relatively stable in recent years, which Fitch views as  indicative of a strong and relatively high degree of prudence in its reserving.  In 2013, reserve releases were 10.3% as a percentage of prior year equity, which  is higher than most peers.  Fitch expects Hiscox to continue to focus on growth of business outside its  traditional market. Hiscox International and Hiscox Europe reported gross  written premium growth in 2013 of 12.9% to GBP472.1m and 10.9% to GBP146.7m,  respectively. Fitch believes that Hiscox's operations outside the UK will  continue to grow, supported by the development of new product offerings and  continued marketing expenditure. In 2013, all of Hiscox's underwriting divisions  contributed positively to the technical result and the group's growth.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade could be triggered by a considerable erosion of capital, equivalent  to a sustained increase in net underwriting leverage to 1.5x (2012: 0.9x). A  deterioration in profitability, reflected in a combined ratio consistently above  97%, or a notable decline in profitability compared with peers could also result  in a downgrade.  An upgrade is unlikely, given the medium scale of the company.  The rating actions are as follows:  Hiscox Insurance Company Limited: IFS affirmed at 'A+'; Outlook Stable Hiscox Insurance Company (Guernsey) Limited: IFS affirmed at 'A+'; Outlook  Stable Hiscox Insurance Company (Bermuda) Limited: IFS affirmed at 'A+'; Outlook Stable Hiscox Ltd: Long-term IDR affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook Stable
