WARSAW, July 17 (Reuters) - Poland's third-largest bank BZ WBK <BZW.WA> said on Thursday it had issued 475 million zlotys ($155 million) in 3-year floating-rate bonds yielding one percentage point above the country's 6-month interbank rate.

The bank said it planned to list the papers on the Warsaw-based BondSpot bond market and on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. "The aim is to diversify our financing sources," a BZ WBK spokeswoman said, adding the issue was similar to one from last year. BZ WBK is controlled by Spain's Santander <SAN.MC> and has a market capitalisation of $10.6 billion. It issued bonds worth 500 million zlotys in December last year.
