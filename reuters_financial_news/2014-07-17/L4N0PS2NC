MUMBAI, July 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose for a third straight session on Thursday as lenders such as Kotak Mahindra Bank <KTKM.NS> extended gains on upbeat sentiment as the central bank exempted long-term bonds for the infrastructure sector from reserve requirements.

Also, overseas investors bought Indian shares worth of 6.21 billion rupees ($103.5 million) on Wednesday, provisional exchange data showed. Sentiment also got a boost as the monsoon rains were 15 percent below average in the past week, against 41 percent below average rainfall in the previous week, the weather office data showed.

"Markets are likely to trade range-bound in the short term. Corporate earnings are the immediate trigger and there would be stock-specific movements. There could be some profit booking in select stocks, however, long-term trend is still bullish," said Suresh Parmar, head, institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> rose 0.21 percent, or 16.05 points, to end at 7,640.45, marking its second straight highest close since July 7, when it hit a record closing high.
