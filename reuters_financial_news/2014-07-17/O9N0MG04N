OSLO, July 17 (Reuters) - Norwegian household credit demand rose faster than expected in the second quarter and banks expect overall household credit demand to remain unchanged in the third quarter, the central bank said in a quarterly survey on Thursday.

Lending margins to businesses fell in the second quarter, in line with expectations, and banks expect lending margins to continue to fall in the third quarter, the central bank added.
