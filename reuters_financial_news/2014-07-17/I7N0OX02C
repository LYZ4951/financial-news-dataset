ISTANBUL, July 17 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank cut its one-week repo rate by 50 basis points to 8.25 percent on Thursday, saying inflation was falling and global liquidity conditions were improving.

The bank kept its overnight lending rate at 12 percent and its overnight borrowing rate at 8 percent.
