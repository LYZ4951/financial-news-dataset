July 17 (Reuters) - State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc <RBS.L> is shuttering a distressed-debt unit as it continues to shrink its investment bank, Bloomberg reported, citing three people familiar with the matter.

"We are materially reducing our special situations group," Bloomberg quoted RBS spokeswoman Sarah Lukashok as saying. RBS did not respond immediately to a request for comment made by Reuters.  Distressed debt involves the purchase of the debt of companies in or near bankruptcy at a deep discount.
