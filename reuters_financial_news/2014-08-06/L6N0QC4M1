FRANKFURT, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Buyout group KKR <KKR.N> increased its offer to take full control of German cutlery and coffee-machine maker WMF <WMFG.F> by 5 euros ($6.68) to 58 euros per share, the investment company said on Wednesday.

KKR also extended the offer period until August 25. KKR, which already owns 72 percent of WMF, launched an offer in July to take full control of the company, which it then plans to delist from the Frankfurt stock exchange. [ID:nL6N0PP25E]
