HONG KONG, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd (HKEx) <0388.HK>, the world's largest listed stock market operator, posted a 1 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, as an increase in listing fees offset weaker share trading volumes.

Net profit rose to HK$1.19 billion in April-June from HK$1.17 billion a year earlier, according to a Reuters calculation from an HKEx statement on Wednesday. That was better than the average estimate of five analysts polled by Reuters, who had expected profit for the quarter to fall to HK$1.1 billion.
