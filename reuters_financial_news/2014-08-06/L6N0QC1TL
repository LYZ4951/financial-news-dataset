EDINBURGH, Aug 6 (Reuters) - European shares fell in early deals on Wednesday, with appetite for equities knocked back by a resurgence in geopolitical tension over Ukraine and some weaker than expected earnings reports.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.8 percent at 1,324.53 by 0704 GMT, with the German DAX <.GDAXI>, whose firms are heavily dependent on Russian energy, down 1.1 percent. Equities fell after reports that Russian troops were massing at the eastern Ukrainian border, where pro-Moscow rebels are in conflict with the Ukrainian government - ratcheting up geopolitical tension in the region. [ID:nL4N0QC055] Russian President Vladimir Putin also ordered his government to prepare retaliatory measures against the latest round of Western sanctions, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday. [ID:nL6N0QB43E] "President Putin reportedly ordered his government to investigate retaliatory sanctions against the EU and U.S," Stan Shamu, market strategist at IG, said in a trading note.  "There is also renewed build-up of Russian troops at the Ukraine border resulting in fears of Russia invading Ukraine."
