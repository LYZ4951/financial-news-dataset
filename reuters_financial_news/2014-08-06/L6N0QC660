LISBON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Portugal's CMVM securities market regulator announced a one-day ban on short selling in shares of Millennium bcp <BCP.LS> for Thursday after the bank's stocks slumped 15 percent on Wednesday, CMVM said in a statement.

Shares in Portuguese banks fell sharply earlier on Wednesday, led by Millennium bcp, on concerns that lenders may end up footing part of the rescue bill for rival Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> after a 4.9 billion euro injection mostly in state loans. [ID:nL6N0QC5XN]
