MUMBAI, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India's interest rate moves will be guided more by domestic factors than external ones, Governor Raghuram Rajan told analyts in a conference call on Wednesday, a day after he left rates unchanged, as widely expected.

The central bank governor said the RBI does not manage liquidity through foreign exchange markets, and added it could consider increasing the foreign debt limits, should the existing limits fill up.
