COPENHAGEN, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Regional financial institution Ringkjobing Landbobank <RILBA.CO> posted a rise in pretax profit for the second quarter due to an increase in customer base in both the branch network and niche concepts. [ID:nWEB00R1C]

Following are quotes from Chief Executive John Fisker:  "The Danish economy is moving slowly in the right direction. We can see our corporate customers increase their activities. Private customers are still consolidating their household finances and I expect that it will take a good while before we see higher activity among private customers."  "Existing customers have paid off their loans but new customers at the bank represent a 14 percent increase in bank loans and 11 percent increase in deposits."  "No banks that fits into our strategy is up for sale. We will continue to focus on the organic growth strategy with focus on private banking, financing wind farm projects and other niche areas."
