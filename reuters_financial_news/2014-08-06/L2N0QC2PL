Aug 6 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc <STI.N>, a U.S. southeast regional bank, on Wednesday said it is cooperating with the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in New York in a broader-based industry investigation regarding claims for foreclosure-related expenses charged by law firms.

In a regulatory filing, the Atlanta-based lender said the charges concern the foreclosure of loans guaranteed or insured by government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> or Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB>, or by the Federal Housing Administration.
