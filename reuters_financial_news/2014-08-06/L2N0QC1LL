TORONTO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Great-West Lifeco Inc <GWO.TO>, Canada's second-largest life insurer, said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit rose 18 percent, helped by the acquisition of Irish Life Group last year.

Winnipeg, Manitoba-based Great-West, which is 71-percent owned by Canadian holding company Power Financial Corp, earned a net C$615 million in the quarter, or 62 Canadian cents a share, up from a year-ago profit of C$521 million, or 55 Canadian cents a share. The results met analysts' estimates of a profit of 62 Canadian cents a share. Great-West owns insurance subsidiaries including London Life and Canada Life, as well as Putnam Investments. Last July, the company acquired Irish Life, Ireland's largest life and pension company.
