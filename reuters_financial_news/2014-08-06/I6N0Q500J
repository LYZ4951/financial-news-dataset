MILAN, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Italian insurer UnipolSai <US.MI> said on Wednesday its net profit in the first half rose 4.5 percent on a proforma basis to take account of a merger with a peer, lifted by a strong performance in life insurance.

Italy's No. 2 insurer, created from the merger of Unipol and the Fondiaria SAI group, said in a statement its net profit in the six months to June was 357 million euros ($478 million). The Bologna-based insurer said its Solvency I ratio was 1.6 times regulatory requirements.
