LAGOS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> fell 0.43 percent against the U.S. dollar on the interbank market on Wednesday after importers brought forward their obligations to take advantage of a recent rally in the local currency.

The local unit closed at 161.65 naira to the dollar, weaker than the 160.95 naira it closed the previous day. The naira on Monday firmed to an almost 3-month high against the greenback.[nL6N0QA3OP] Traders said the local unit of Eni <ENI.M1> sold $20 million to some lenders on Wednesday, but it was not sufficient to support the naira. "There was a lot of demand in the market today ... from importers buying dollars," one dealer said.
