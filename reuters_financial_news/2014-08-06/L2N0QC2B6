TORONTO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index closed little changed on Wednesday as concerns that Russia might move troops into Ukraine were offset by gains in shares of Tim Hortons Inc <THI.TO> and gold producers.

NATO said Russia has massed about 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine's eastern border and could use the pretext of a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission to invade. Russia also announced another round of retaliatory sanctions against Europe and the United States.
