HONG KONG, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Fierce competition is squeezing commission fees for banks in the red-hot offshore yuan bond market, even as issuance reaches record levels.

The primary market was dominated by issuers with strong credit ratings in the first half of the year, putting extra pressure on fees.Underwriting fees for the offshore yuan, or "dim sum" bonds totalled $77.8 million in the first half, up 30 percent from a year earlier, but still comprehensively lagging the 53 percent rise in total issuance volume and an 82 percent gain in the number of deals done according to Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting.  That suggests the average commission rate to underwrite offshore yuan bonds has declined. The top five dim sum bond underwriters are HSBC <0005.HK><HSBA.L>, Standard Chartered <STAN.L>, DBS <DBSM.SI>, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> and Bank of China <3988.HK><601988.SS>. The lower average commission rate in the dim sum market this year is also in line with that in the Asian dollar market, where fees dropped 22 percent even as the number of deals climbed 27 percent in the first half. "One of the factors (that drives down fees) is the pick-up in issuance from banks. Banks, because of their strong credit ratings, pay lower fees compared to issuance from corporates or high yields," said Paul Au, Asian head of debt syndicate at UBS. Banks and other financial institutions accounted for 83 percent of the total dim sum bond issue volume from January to June this year, up from 77 percent for the same period in 2013, Thomson Reuters statistics showed. The robust supply from Chinese banks was encouraged by lower funding costs in the offshore market as liquidity in China's domestic market was tight partly due to capital outflows triggered by a sluggish economy and a weak currency at the beginning of the year. In addition, an expanded quota that was granted by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) this year to allow mainland entities to sell yuan bonds in Hong Kong has also been actively utilised by banks. "Appetite for high-yield bonds, which are usually dominated by Chinese property companies, is weak this year, as the sector is slowing down and investors have concerns on their earnings," said a debt capital market (DCM) banker at a Chinese bank in Hong Kong. A number of small developers - the kind that by sheer weight of numbers dominates China's vast property sector - are set to report big drops in earnings or even losses as the industry grapples with tight credit, sluggish sales and excess supply. [ID:nL4N0PZ1OL] Debt capital market bankers say underwriting fees for investment-grade dim sum bonds are usually around 50 basis points (bps) of the issue size and can be as low as 20 bps for issuers with extremely strong credit. For high-yield bonds, it's not difficult to obtain underwriting fees of about 1.5-2 percent of the issue size, depending on the quality of the issuer.  The momentum of issuance from financial institutions may slow down in the second half as Beijing has started to loosen up liquidity in the onshore market, which will make room for more corporate issuance there, said Steve Wang, head of fixed-income research at Bank of China International (BOCI).
