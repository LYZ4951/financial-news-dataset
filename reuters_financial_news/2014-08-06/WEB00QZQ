ZURICH, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Swiss Re <SRENH.VX>, the world's second largest reinsurer, posted a lower-than-expected rise in second-quarter net profit to $802 million for the second quarter, and said it saw prices in the insurance industry weakening further.

"We see the insurance market generally softening," Chief Executive Michel Lies said in a statement.
