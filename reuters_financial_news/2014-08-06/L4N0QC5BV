Aug 6 (Reuters) - Kellogg Co <K.N> is considering a 2 billion pound ($3.37 billion) offer for United Biscuits <IPO-UNI.L>, the UK-based maker of McVitie's, Sky News reported.

Industry insiders have said Kellogg could be a possible suitor for United Biscuits, given its large presence in the snack aisle with Keebler cookies, Pop Tarts and Cheez-It crackers and due to the struggles at its core cereal business. Sky News said Kellogg was working with investment bank Barclays on a possible deal.
