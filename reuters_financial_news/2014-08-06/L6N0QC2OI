EDINBURGH, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Italian blue-chip shares fell deeper into negative territory on Wednesday after economic data showed that the country had unexpectedly fallen back into recession in the second quarter.

The Italy FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> index was down 2.2 percent at 0921 GMT, extending losses after preliminary gross-domestic-product data for the second quarter showed a 0.2 percent fall. The index is down 13.4 percent from its June highs. The GDP figure was below all forecasts in a Reuters survey of 25 analysts, which had pointed to a second-quarter gain of 0.2 percent. Forecasts ranged from a 0.1 percent fall to a gain of 0.4 percent.
