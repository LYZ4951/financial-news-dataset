TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co [MEIJY.UL] is continuing to seek acquisition opportunities in emerging markets and the United States, and is starting to consider buying majority stakes, said a top executive at Japan's third-largest life insurer.

Meiji Yasuda and its domestic peers have been expanding overseas in recent years as sales of products such as death benefit policies are widely expected to shrink at home as society ages and the working population declines. Investments have been limited to minority stakes in Asian counterparts worth less than $1 billion. But in June, Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co Ltd <8750.T> agreed to buy all of U.S. peer Protective Life Corp <PL.N> for $5.7 billion, in what would be the biggest acquisition by a Japanese insurer. [ID:nL3N0OL0Z0] Meiji Yasuda would also consider majority stakes in future overseas M&As, particularly in the United States, now it has experience of the industry in other countries, Deputy President Hiroaki Tonooka said in an interview on Wednesday. "Our main targets are growth markets such as Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America," Tonooka said. "But these areas take time (to make significant contributions to profit) so we are also looking at developed markets including North America." The insurer said it has up to 250 billion yen ($2.4 billion) for overseas M&As for the three years through March 2017. Its most recent purchase was 15 percent of Thai Life Assurance PCL <THREL.BK> last year in a deal one person familiar with the matter valued at around $700 million.

In the business year ended March, the six accounted for less than 2 percent of Meiji Yasuda's 300 billion yen in pretax profit. The company aims to increase overseas contributions to 10 percent organically and through acquisitions over the next decade, Tonooka said. The executive said Meiji Yasuda is not in talks with any potential targets. But he expects a flow of insurance assets to go on sale as global financial conglomerates divest of non-core assets to raise funds to cope with stricter capital requirements.
