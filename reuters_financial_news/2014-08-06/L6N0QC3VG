DUBAI, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Ahli United Bank, Bahrain's largest lender, posted 35.1 percent rise in its second-quarter net profit, the bank said in a statement on Wednesday, as core operating earnings grew.

The bank's net attributable profit for the three months to June 30 was $125.9 million, compared with $93.2 million in the corresponding period of 2013. Arqaam Capital and SICO Bahrain expected the bank to make a net profit of $109 million and $125.98 million in the quarter respectively.

Loans and advances stood at $23.1 billion at the end of June. AUB has been the subject of M&A speculation, with sources telling Reuters in April that a stake in the bank could be sold or it could be merged with another bank. [ID:nL6N0N74KQ]
