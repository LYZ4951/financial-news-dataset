FRANKFURT, March 5 (Reuters) - Prospective buyers of Deutsche Annington <ANNGn.DE> shares were given a price guidance of 19 euros per share as part of the German property group's capital increase, a person familiar with the transaction told Reuters on Wednesday.

The books were closed, the source added. Deutsche Annington on Tuesday said its sale of 16 million new shares in a capital increase to help fund property buys would also see shareholder Terra Firma [TERA.UL] sell 11 million shares of its holding in the German real estate group. [ID:nL6N0M14C7]
