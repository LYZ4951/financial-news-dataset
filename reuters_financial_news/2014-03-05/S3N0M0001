COPENHAGEN, March 5 (Reuters) - Retail purchases with the Danish national debit card, Dankort, rose 5.1 percent in February from a year earlier to 23 billion Danish crowns, card payment services firm Nets said on Wednesday.

The data are an indicator of private consumption and come ahead of the national statistics agency's retail sales figures.
