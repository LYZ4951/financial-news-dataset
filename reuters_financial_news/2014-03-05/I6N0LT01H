MILAN, March 5 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's third biggest lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> extended gains to rise more than 20 percent in heavy volumes on Wednesday, with traders citing short-covering and speculative buying on the stock.

The shares soared 21 percent to 0.22 percent by 1611 GMT, with volumes nine times the daily average. "There is a lot of short covering," said one fund manager. He also mentioned a report on La Repubblica daily's website citing a warning by the European Commission that the bank may have to cut costs further if it does not make enough profits to pay a coupon on state loans it received last year.
