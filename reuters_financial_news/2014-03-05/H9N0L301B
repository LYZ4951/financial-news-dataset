HONG KONG, March 5 (Reuters) - China shares sank on Wednesday, led by the banking sector on fears of a possible default by a listed company and on Beijing's plan to introduce deposit insurance, a move towards freeing up deposit rates.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, which fell 0.2 percent on Tuesday, closed down 0.9 percent at 2,053.1 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also dropped 0.9 percent. [ID:nL3N0M21H2] The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mainly high tech startups listed in Shenzhen rose 0.3 percent.  In what would be the country's first domestic bond default, loss-making Chinese solar equipment producer Chaori Solar <002506.SZ> said it will not be able to meet interest payments on bonds due on Friday.
