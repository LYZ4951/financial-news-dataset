CAIRO, March 5 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> strengthened slightly against the dollar at a central bank sale of foreign currency on Wednesday, but has been trading weaker on the black market.

The central bank sold $38.3 million to banks at the auction, with a cut-off price of 6.9505 pounds to the dollar, compared with 6.9506 pounds at Monday's auction. <CBEO> <EGP=> On the black market, the dollar was offered at around 7.37 pounds on Tuesday, a market participant said. The pound has been under pressure during three years of political turmoil. Egypt's foreign currency reserves stood at about $17.3 billion pounds in February, down from $36 billion before the uprising that led to President Hosni Mubarak's downfall in 2011.
