March 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings believes that the likely first default of a Chinese corporate onshore bond will be positive for the market in the long term as it will instil greater discipline to price credit risk more effectively. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Co.,  Ltd. <002506.SZ> (Chaori) has warned it will not make in full a CNY89m interest payment due  7 March 2014 on an onshore interbank bond with a March 2017 maturity. Chaori's expected default coincides with the annual National People's Congress,  a meeting of China's political leadership. That the Chaori default has been  allowed to emerge may signal a shift in the government's stance towards a  greater tolerance of outright corporate defaults. Chaori's bonds have a large  retail investor base, which makes the case even more noteworthy. In the recent years, local governments have intervened several times to prevent  defaults in the onshore corporate credit market in order to maintain economic  and social stability. In particular, corporate bond defaults have been prevented  because China has a keen interest in expanding its onshore bond market.  The onset of an outright default is likely to lead to a re-pricing of corporate  credit risk as the common perception that the government will bail out all  struggling companies falls away. Weaker Chinese corporates may therefore see an  increase in their onshore borrowing costs. Fitch expects a reduction of onshore  lenders' and investors' risk appetites, which could pressure frailer companies'  liquidity, especially in sectors challenged by cyclical downturns and persistent  capacity surpluses.  We see onshore corporate credit defaults as a long-term positive for China's  financial system as it should instil greater market discipline and lead to a  more efficient allocation of capital among corporate borrowers. It may also  prompt further regulatory progress to provide more clarity on the legal process  governing domestic bankruptcies and restructuring, which should benefit both  onshore and offshore creditors in the long run.
