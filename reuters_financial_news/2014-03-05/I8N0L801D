MUMBAI, Mar 5 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index edged up on Wednesday to approach a record closing high hit last month, extending a recent rally as continued foreign-investor buying boosted blue chips such as ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS>.

ICICI Bank shares provisionally rose 2.8 percent, while Bank of Baroda Ltd <BOB.NS> gained 6.4 percent. The BSE index <.BSESN> rose 0.26 percent to a provisional close of 21,265.49, near a record closing high of 21,373.66 hit on Jan. 23.
