MILAN, March 5 (Reuters) - Risanamento <RN.MI> investor Luigi Zunino has dropped a legal action against a vital sale of the Italian real estate group's Paris assets, a source with knowledge of the matter said.

The planned sale to UK-based fund Chelsfield concerns nine high-end properties in central Paris and would help the company reduce the bulk of its 1.8 billion euro ($2.5 billion) debt.
