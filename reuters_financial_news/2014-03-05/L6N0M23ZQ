LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Wednesday as the United States and Russia planned talks to ease tensions over Ukraine, while Spain and Italy outperformed on signs their economies were gathering strength.

The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> closed flat at 3,135.97 points, but the Spanish and Italian markets - dubbed as the "periphery" by many investors compared to the "core" of Germany and France - fared better. Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> equity index rose 1.4 percent while Spain's benchmark IBEX <.IBEX> index advanced by 0.9 percent, outperforming falls in Germany and France. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which fell 2.2 percent at the start of the week on fears of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, edged down 0.1 percent to 1,343.99 points. The Milan and Madrid bourses rose after Markit composite purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) for Italy and Spain both beat forecasts and came in above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. [ID:nL6N0M22C5] Shares in Italy's third-biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>, also surged by nearly 20 percent.[ID:nI6N0LT01H] Analysts said speculation about fresh action from the European Central Bank on Thursday to spur the region's economy and fend off the threat of ultra-low inflation was also acting as an extra support for European equities. Andrea Williams, European equities fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, backed Italian and Spanish stocks such as Italian airport and motorway operator Atlantia <ATL.MI>, Spanish electricity grid operator Red Electrica <REE.MC> and Spanish oil group Repsol <REP.MC>.  "We don't have a lot of exposure to the periphery but I can see that their economies are improving," said Williams. >^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Europe bourses in 2014: http://link.reuters.com/pad95v Asset performance in 2014: http://link.reuters.com/rav46v Today's European research round-up [RCH/EUROPE] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<CRIMEA CONCERNS In spite of a hit to equity markets this week from Ukraine, European stock markets have maintained their upwards trajectory from last year, with the FTSEurofirst 300 up by around 2 percent after having risen 16 percent in 2013.
