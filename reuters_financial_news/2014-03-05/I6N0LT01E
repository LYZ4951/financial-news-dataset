MILAN, March 5 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> were suspended from trading limit-up on Wednesday after rising almost 10 percent on Milan's bourse.

A Milan-based trader said earlier in the day that the shares were bought because they were seen as cheap after falling to a one-month low of 0.1778 euros on March 3.
