MILAN, March 5 (Reuters) - Shares in Credito Valtellinese (CreVal) <PCVI.MI> were suspended from trading on Wednesday, after reversing opening losses and rising as much as 8 percent, following an announcement of a 400 million euros rights issue.[nL6N0M144R]

CreVal reported on Tuesday a 2013 net profit of 11.7 million euros, after goodwill writedowns led to a loss the previous year. After market closed, the lender announced a rights issue to bolster its capital base as an asset review of the sector by the European Central Bank gets under way. "It is an unusual reaction, but also shares in Banco Popolare did the same after it announced a capital increase," a Milan-based trader said. "The initial fall may have triggered speculative buys," he added. Shares initially fell as much as 2 percent. Italy's banking stock index <.FTIT8300> rose 1 percent. Broker ICBPI said in a note CreVal's results met expectations and the capital increase was also expected given the European Central Bank's asset-quality review.
