HANOI, March 5 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> climbed 0.87 percent to close at 574.94 points on Wednesday as investors picked up stocks that lost over the past sessions, analysts said.

The index bounced back from a three-week low on Tuesday thanks to bargain buying around the support level of 565 points, analysts said.

Its shares advanced 1.36 percent after a three-session fall of 3.9 percent, Reuters data showed.
