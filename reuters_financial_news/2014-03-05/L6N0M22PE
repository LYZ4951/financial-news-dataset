LAGOS, March 5 (Reuters) - Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves had fallen to a 19-month low of $39.72 billion by March 3, data from central bank showed on Wednesday, as the regulator aggressively sells dollars to prop-up the naira currency.

Forex reserves have fallen 16.48 percent since this time last year and are down 7.13 percent in the last month.
