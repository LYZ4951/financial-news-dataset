PARIS/LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Bouygues' <BOUY.PA> bid for Vivendi's SFR <VIV.PA> will be financed with cash, debt, and shares in the newly combined company, and will not require a capital increase, said two people close to the situation.

Vivendi is expecting offers for France's second-biggest telecom group from French cable operator Numericable <NUME.PA> and Bouygues <BOUY.PA>, sources earlier said, ahead of a 1900GMT deadline on Wednesday. "The financing is perfectly lined up and there is no need to do a cash call," said one of the people. A spokesman for Bouygues did not return a request for comment.
