BERLIN, March 5 (Reuters) - Lufthansa <LHAG.DE>, Germany's largest airline, unveiled its new premium economy class on Wednesday, part of a strategy to reinforce its position as a top-class airline against fast-growing rivals from the Middle East.

The airline said the new class will be available on long-haul flights from November on its Boeing 747-8, flying to destinations such as Washington DC, Los Angeles or Hong Kong. A return flight will cost on average 600 euros more than a regular economy ticket.
