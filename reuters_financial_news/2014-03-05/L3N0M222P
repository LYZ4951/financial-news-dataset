March 5 (Reuters) - Engineering turnaround specialist Melrose Industries <MRON.L> <MRON.L> full-year headline pretax profit almost doubled, boosted by the acquisition of Elster, which makes meters for measuring gas, water and electricity consumption.

Melrose, which follows a private equity type model of buy, improve and sell, said profit in Elster, acquired in 2012, increased by over a third in the first full year of ownership.
