SAO PAULO, March 5 (Reuters) - Brazilian real estate developer BR Properties SA <BRPR3.SA> will sell most of its industrial warehouses and logistics facilities to Singapore-listed Global Logistic Properties Limited <GLPL.SI> for 3.18 billion reais ($1.36 billion), according to a securities filing on Wednesday.

In November, BR Properties announced it would sell the properties to WTGoodman IBP Participações, a joint venture between Australia's Goodman Group Pty Ltd <GMG.AX> and local developer WTorre, pending a due diligence period. In Wednesday's filing, however, BR Properties said the deal was now being carried out with GLP's LPP Empreendimentos e Participações unit after WTGoodman IBP's exclusivity agreement expired. The deal with GLP is subject to regulatory approval, "among other conditions," BR Properties said in the filing. Representatives for BR Properties, GLP and WGoodman's Brazil unit were not immediately available for comment. Cash generated by the sale will be used to cut debt, buy back shares and pay dividends, BR Properties said.
