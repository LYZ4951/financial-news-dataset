OSLO, March 5 (Reuters) - Investment firm Heraldic Holding has bought an additional 13.9 percent stake in electricity infrastructure builder Infratek <INFRAT.OL>, lifting its overall holding to 94.6 percent, Heraldic said in a statement on Wednesday.

Heraldic paid 18 Norwegian crowns per share, 4 crowns more than it paid last year when it bought almost 80 percent of the shares. By crossing the 90-percent threshold, it will now be able to force out the remaining owners.
