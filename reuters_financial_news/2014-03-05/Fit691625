March 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Instituto de Finanzas de  Cantabria's [INSFI.UL] (ICAF) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) at 'BBB' and its Short-term foreign currency rating at 'F2'.  Fitch has  also affirmed ICAF's outstanding bonds at 'BBB'. The Outlook has been revised to  Stable from Negative.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  ICAF's ratings are based on its clear link to the Autonomous Community of  Cantabria (BBB/Stable/F2), and on the explicit financial support from the  regional government stated in its charter. The institute's objectives are to  contribute the region's sustainable economic and social development and carry  out the financial management and supervision of Cantabria's stake holding in  several public sector entities' (PSEs). The Outlook revision reflects its  sponsor's Outlook. In December 2011 the Autonomous Community of Cantabria decided to explicitly  guarantee the fulfilment of any obligations and liabilities that ICAF has with  any third party and the regional government will provide the relevant economic  resources to do so. Fitch also understands that in the extreme event that ICAF  would have to be liquidated, such an outcome would not occur before all its  liabilities had been fulfilled.  ICAF meets all the criteria under the agency's methodology to be classified as a  dependent entity of the region. Since November 2011, the national regulator has  classified ICAF as an entity that belongs to the regional government's  administrative sector. The consequence for the Autonomous Community of Cantabria  is that the deficits incurred by ICAF as well as its debt will now be included  in its fiscal targets, therefore the regional administration may become even  more vigilant to any deviations from ICAF's initial budget. ICAF had financial debt at end 2013 of EUR133.5m with moderate debt repayment in  the medium term. The credit exposure including the debt guaranteed by ICAF is  relatively moderate at EUR157m and essentially on the public sector constituting  about 65% of total risk including loans and debt guarantees. In the past three  years, ICAF made significant reserves on potential impaired loans that totalled  EUR24.7m at end 2013 or about 19% of its assets. In particular, ICAF had to  assume liabilities of the soccer club Racing Santander for a total of EUR11.8m.  In 2014 ICAF expects to receive financial compensation from the regional  government through a capital injection, with the aim to bring the capital ratio  at 12% in 2014 (equity / loans net of impairment charges) while it was negative  in 2013.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  A change in ICAF's legal status, which is rather unlikely, or a downgrade of  Cantabria's ratings would automatically be reflected in a change in ICAF's  ratings. Conversely, an upgrade of Cantabria will be necessary for an upgrade of ICAF.  RATING ASSUMPTIONS
