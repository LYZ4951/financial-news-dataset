ZAGREB, March 5 (Reuters) - Croatia's government, struggling to observe EU budget deficit limits, said on Wednesday it has lowered its 2014 general budget deficit target by one percentage point to 4.5 percent of GDP, thanks to plans to raise its revenue.

Revenues will be boosted by higher health contributions, a higher lottery tax and concession fees. The government will also draw on part of the profits of public companies and reduce the number of beneficiaries of private pension funds, said Finance Minister Slavko Linic.
