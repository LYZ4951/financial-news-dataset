March 5 (Reuters) - Egyptian investment bank EFG-Hermes <HRHO.CA> has agreed to sell its 19 percent stake in United Arab Emirates jeweller Damas to Qatar's Mannai Corp <MCCS.QA> for $150 million, a source familiar with the deal said on Wednesday.

Mannai and EFG-Hermes took control of the jeweller in April 2012, with Mannai holding 66 percent of Damas and the Egyptian company owning 19 percent.
