ROME, March 5 (Reuters) - Italian watchdog Consob is probing sharp share price movements in troubled lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>, a regulatory source said on Wednesday, after the stock shot up more than 20 percent during the day.

Cobsob has asked large trading houses in Italy and abroad for information on the price movements, the source said.
