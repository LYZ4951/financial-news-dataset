DUBLIN, March 5 (Reuters) - Allied Irish Banks <ALBK.I> will wait until European stress tests are out of the way to sell its contingent capital notes, even though it is confident of getting the all-clear later this year, Chief Executive David Duffy said.

The bank announced a review of its capital structure on Tuesday, including the sale of the CoCo bonds and a conversion of its preference shares, after more than halving its full-year loss in 2013 and returning to operating profit. [ID:nL6N0M211A] "I wouldn't say we'd do it ahead of the stress tests. There's no upside in taking risk," Duffy told Reuters in a telephone interview, adding that at today's prices the bank would sell at least at par, if not at a profit.
