STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Reuters) - Telecoms operator Tele2 <TEL2b.ST> hopes to further increase its share of the corporate segment in its Swedish home market after gaining on industry leader TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST> last year, the company told Reuters in an interview.

Top operator TeliaSonera recently said it had lost ground in the Swedish corporate segment, which makes up about one third of the country's overall mobile services market, according to The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS). "I have a very optimistic view (of the corporate segment), for the same reason Telia says it's a tough market," Thomas Ekman, head of Tele2's Swedish unit, told Reuters. He said market shares were relatively stable before 2013, but that companies last year began to look for better offers. The drivers behind this change were smartphones, new applications, fourth-generation (4G) mobile networks and flat rates, he said, noting that corporate clients now use phones not only to call and text, but also for services. "This has made companies wake up, wanting to evaluate their whole solution for communication," Ekman said, adding that changes like these naturally put pressure on the market leader. Tele2 Sweden has traditionally had good market positions with very small and very big companies, and hopes to gain ground in the small to medium sized corporate segment. "There we see possibilities to win market shares," Ekman said. Based on segment data it has compiled from the PTS, Tele2 estimates that it had a total share of the corporate market of around 12 percent at the end of 2012, far behind TeliaSonera but marginally ahead of Telenor's <TEL.OL> Swedish unit. Official full-year 2013 data are not yet available but Tele2 believes it gained share, while TeliaSonera admits it lost some. Ekman said there is moderate price pressure in the corporate market, as smaller players, like Denmark's TDC <TDC.CO>, have entered the market, while the smallest customers tend to look for better deals as they compare their prices to the lower priced residential telecoms services.   A BUYER, NOT A SELLER In addition to TeliaSonera, Tele2 and Telenor, operator 3 Scandinavia, owned by Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa <0013.HK> and Swedish investment company Investor <INVEb.ST>, also runs a network in the country. The potential for consolidation in the sector has for years been a hot topic of discussion, as having four mobile operators in a country of about ten million people has been seen as too crowded. But little has happened, and Ekman didn't predict that any changes would come. Instead he reiterated statements made earlier by Tele2's chief executive, who has said that if anything happens in the Swedish market, then Tele2 will be a buyer and not a seller.
