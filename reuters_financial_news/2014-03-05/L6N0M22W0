LAGOS, March 5 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> firmed to its strongest in two weeks against the dollar on the interbank market on Wednesday, after state-owned energy company NNPC sold around $400 million to lenders, traders said.

The local unit closed at 163.80 to the dollar, 0.48 percent stronger than 164.60 the previous day. The naira was the firmest since Feb. 18, when it closed at 162.70 to the dollar.
