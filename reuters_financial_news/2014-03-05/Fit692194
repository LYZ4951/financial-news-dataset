March 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Brit Insurance Holdings B.V.'s <32OW.L> Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook and its subordinated notes at 'BB+'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation is in response to the announcement made on 04 March 2014 of the  intention to float the Brit group (Brit) on the London Stock Exchange. The  affirmations and Stable Outlook reflect the agency's view that the initial  public offering (IPO) of a 25% minimum free float is a marginal credit positive.  The agency recognises the improvements that have been made to Brit's  underwriting performance since the company was taken into private ownership and  views the announcement of the IPO as a natural progression for the insurer,  which removes some uncertainty around the possibility and nature of a return to  public ownership. Fitch will closely monitor Brit's post-IPO profile, specifically in relation to  the size and timing of any further share sales, dividend strategy and overall  capitalisation. Fitch also notes the shareholder lock-up arrangements which  prevent any further sales by the majority shareholders, Apollo and CVC, for 180  days and by management and other employees for 365 days following completion of  the IPO.  The affirmations also reflect the solid financial profile of Brit, which is  supported by a strong level of risk-adjusted capitalisation and underlying  earnings. The group reported an overall profit after tax for 2013 of GBP101.7m  (2012: GBP84.7m). The reported combined ratio, excluding FX effects, was 85.2%  (2012: 93.2%), which was assisted by the continued benign catastrophe  environment.  Brit will continue to be majority owned by Achilles Netherlands Holdings B.V, a  holding company majority owned by funds managed by Apollo Management VII, L.P.  and funds advised by CVC Capital Partners Ltd [CVC.UL].   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for a downgrade include failure by Brit to maintain  financial leverage and capitalisation at levels at least commensurate with the  current ratings. Any marked shift towards a more risky investment portfolio  could lead to negative rating pressure.
