FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The 25 euro zone lenders that failed the European Central Bank's landmark health check of the banking sector had a capital shortfall of 25 billion euros ($31.7 billion) at the end of last year, the ECB said on Sunday.

Twelve of the 25 banks that failed the exercise, which was based on the banks' financial positions at the end of 2013, have since covered their capital shortfalls by increasing their capital by 15 billion euros in 2014, the central bank said. Goldman Sachs investors expected banks to have to raise an additional 51 billion euros, taking into account capital raises that had already happened by August. The ECB has spent the last year reviewing the assets of the euro zone's 130 biggest lenders and subjecting them to rigorous stress tests - an exercise aimed at flushing out any problems in the sector before it begins supervising the lenders from Nov. 4. The central bank also wants the review to draw a line under persistent doubts about the health of the euro zone's banking sector, with a view to boosting investor confidence in the region and helping support its flagging economy. "This unprecedented in-depth review of the largest banks' positions will boost public confidence in the banking sector," ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said in a statement. "This should facilitate more lending in Europe, which will help economic growth," he added. The fourth EU stress test of banks is being coordinated by the bloc's banking watchdog, the European Banking Authority (EBA), which required 123 banking groups from across the EU states to submit themselves to theoretical shocks such as severe recession. The ECB has also scrutinised the balance sheets of 130 banks in the euro zone, a higher number as it also includes subsidiaries of big banks while the EBA test looks at group holding companies. The ECB exercise has been billed as more transparent and rigorous than previous efforts, and included a forensic assessment of whether banks had properly valued their assets and a stress test - with 'baseline' and 'adverse' scenarios - to see if they had enough capital to withstand another crash. The ECB said its adverse stress test scenario showed banks' capital would be depleted by 263 billion euros, reducing their median core capital ratio to 8.3 percent from 12.4 percent - more than in similar tests in the United States. Banks in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain would take the biggest hits under such adverse conditions. The ECB has said lenders will have six months to cover capital shortfalls reported in its asset quality review or the baseline stress test scenario, and nine months to cover any capital shortfalls from the adverse stress test scenario. Following Sunday's publication of the results, those banks concerned will have two weeks to submit capital plans to the ECB, detailing how shortfalls will be covered. Over the past year, more than 6,000 experts combed through the euro zone's 130 largest banks' books - including household names like Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Santander <SAN.MC> and BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> - to unearth any hidden losses and weaknesses.
