VIENNA, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Austria's Erste Group Bank <ERST.VI> named the head of its Slovakia unit on Sunday as board member for corporate customers and markets, in a revamp that creates a new group board role for its retail business.

Jozef Sikela, chief executive of its Slovenska sporitelna unit, will take over from Franz Hochstrasser, who will leave the board but remain a consultant until the end of 2015, the bank said in a statement. Peter Bosek, now a director of Erste Bank Oesterreich, will become management board member responsible for the Austrian as well as the group-wide retail business. Herbert Juranek, the group's chief operating officer, will also leave the management board. His successor was due to be named within weeks, Erste said.
