COPENHAGEN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Jyske Bank <JYSK.CO> said it had doubled pre-tax profit in the first nine months of this year to 3.4 billion Danish crowns ($579 million) from 1.7 billion crowns in the same period a year ago.

The bank issued its results, which had been due this Wednesday, after the European Banking Authority and the Danish Financial Services Authority published their stress-test results.
