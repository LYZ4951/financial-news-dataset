PARIS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's in-depth health checks of euro zone banks does not reduce the need for ECB actions to get credit flowing to the economy, the head of the French central bank governor said on Sunday.

The ECB published the results of an extensive review of banks' finances earlier on Sunday with the aim of dispelling doubts that they can survive another crisis in hope of getting them lending again to the broader economy. Speaking to journalists, Bank of France governor Christian Noyer said that now that the review was over, concerns about the banking system should lift and credit should start flowing.
