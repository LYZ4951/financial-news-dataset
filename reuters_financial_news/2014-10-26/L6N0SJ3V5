LJUBLJANA, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Slovenia's state-owned banks NLB and NKBM have failed an ECB stress test with a joint capital shortfall of 65 million euros in adverse scenario, the Bank of Slovenia said on Sunday.

It said in a statement both banks would cover the shortfall from their profits as both have improved profitability in 2014. A third bank on the list, SID banka, passed the stress test.
