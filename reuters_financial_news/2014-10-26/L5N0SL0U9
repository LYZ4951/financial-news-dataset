LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Italy's Monte Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> has hired investment banks UBS and Citi to advise it on options to fill a capital shortfall of 2.1 billion euros that emerged after Europe-wide stress tests of the banking sector, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

The source said a range of options were under consideration and it was not clear what the bank would eventually do.
