LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Some 24 European banks failed a "stress test" of their capital strength conducted by the European Banking Authority. [ID:nL6N0SJ42J]

Under the EBA's healthcheck, banks needed to hold common equity of 5.5 percent or more of their risk-weighted assets under a stressed 3-year recession scenario as at the end of 2013. Any bank falling short of that level needs to take action to get to that target, and the EBA said 14 banks still had work to do at the end of September 2014. The following are details released by the EBA on Sunday of the 24 banks. Several other banks narrowly passed and had a common equity capital ratio of less than 6.5 percent at the end of 2013 under the stressed scenario.
