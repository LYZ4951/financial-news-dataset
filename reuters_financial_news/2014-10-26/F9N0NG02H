FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Sabine Lautenschlaeger said on Sunday she took a critical view of some unconventional policy measures such as sovereign bond purchases, which she believed should only be used as a last resort to fight deflation.

Lautenschlaeger told reporters she had no problems with the conventional measures the ECB had taken, such as cutting interest rates to record lows and injecting liquidity into the financial system. "I take a more critical view of some areas of the unconventional measures," she added. The ECB has begun buying covered bonds and plans to buy asset-backed securities (ABS) later this year, but it has so far held off printing money to make U.S.-style purchases of sovereign bonds - so-called quantitative easing (QE). "If we talk about large-scale purchase programmes of securitised assets - the renowned ABS (plan), or even large-scale sovereign bond purchases - then I take a more critical view, because for me the balance between costs and needs is negative at the moment."
