JERUSALEM, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel is expected to leave short-term interest rates unchanged for a second straight month but some analysts believe weak economic growth and a shift to deflation could push the key rate closer to zero.

Eight of the 12 economists polled by Reuters forecast the Bank of Israel will keep its benchmark interest rate at an all-time low of 0.25 percent when it announces its decision on Monday at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT). Three analysts foresee a 0.1 percentage point reduction to 0.15 percent and one expects a 0.15 point cut to 0.1 percent. The bank has not moved in less than quarter-point increments since early 2005, prior to the arrival of former governor Stanley Fischer and it is not clear whether new governor Karnit Flug will change policy. In an Oct. 10 interview with Reuters, Flug voiced openness to reducing rates further or using unconventional policy tools to boost inflation. [ID:nW1N0S3036] Israel's annual inflation rate moved to minus 0.3 percent in September, the first time it has been negative since 2007.  The latest inflation report "supports the view that economic activity and inflation dynamics require an accommodative monetary policy and is posing a risk of a policy rate cut -   potentially a smaller cut than the traditional 25-basis-point  moves - to prevent the policy rate from going to zero," said Credit Suisse economist Nimrod Mevorach. The MPC lowered the rate by a quarter-point in July and again in August as the economy slowed and inflation fell. Credit Suisse's Mevorach said in a report that those cuts "and the favourable impact of the recent shekel depreciation on exports and inflation outlook will probably keep the monetary committee on wait-and-see mode for now". In its last decision, the monetary policy committee's six members all voted to keep the key rate unchanged, saying it was in line with the economic environment. [ID:nL6N0S10LH] Goldman Sachs economist Kasper Lund-Jensen projects a -0.4 or -0.5 percent annual inflation rate in October and expects a 0.2 percentage point rate cut during the fourth quarter. Bond yields suggest the inflation rate will move to 0.9 percent in a year's time, below the government's annual target of 1 to 3 percent. [ID:nL6N0SG23I]  Israeli bond yields have rallied in recent months and are near one-year lows. [ID:nL6N0SH4GV] Israel's shekel <ILS=> stands at 3.78 per dollar having depreciated by 10 percent since July. The Bank of Israel last month lowered its 2014 growth forecast to 2.3 percent from 2.9 percent, largely due to the effects of a war in Gaza in July and August. It maintained a 3 percent estimate for 2015.
