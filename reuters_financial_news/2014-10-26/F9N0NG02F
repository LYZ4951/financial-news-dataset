FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is concerned about a lack of real growth in the euro zone economy, ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said on Sunday.

"We are worried that there is not enough real growth and as a result there is a big slack in the economy," he told reporters after the ECB published the results of its health check of the euro zone's 130 biggest banks. Banks with a capital shortfall will have to say within two weeks how they intend to close the gap and will then be given up to nine months to do so.
