PARIS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - French banks are sufficiently capitalised after health checks of the sector's finances in Europe to see whether they can survive a crisis, the Bank of France said on Sunday.

Mortgage financing vehicle Caisse de Refinancement de l'Habitat (CRH) was the only entity to fail the tests with a capital shortfall of 124 million euros (157.11 million US dollar). However, CRH has already raised sufficient capital since the 2013 cut-off date for the tests. French banks were widely expected to pass. They have sold assets, pulled out of markets such as Greece and raised funds that could qualify for common equity tier one (CET1) capital to meet tougher post-crisis regulations and cope with weak economic conditions. "The results for French banks confirm the quality of their assets and their capacity to withstand severe shocks," the Bank of France said in a statement.
