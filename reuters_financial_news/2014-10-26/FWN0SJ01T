FRANKFURT, Oct 26 (Reuters) - German corporate bank IKB <IKBG.F> said on Sunday it has raised more than 190 million euros this year and has passed a bank stress test led by the European Central Bank.

The lender, Germany's first high-profile victim of the financial crisis, posted a core tier 1 capital ratio of 6.53 percent in the hardest part of the assessment, compared to a minimum requirement of 5.5 percent, ECB data showed. IKB had required several bailouts from development bank KfW [KFW.UL] and the German state after its off-balance sheet investment vehicles ran into funding problems in 2007.  Following the rescues, IKB was taken over by KfW [KFW.UL], which sold it to U.S. buyout group Lone Star in August 2008 for 137 million euros. The investor earlier this year launched a sale of the lender, but it has so far attracted little interest, even after offering to sell it in pieces, people familiar with the process said.[ID:nL5N0MW2EH]
