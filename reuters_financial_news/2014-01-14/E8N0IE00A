MADRID, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Spain's family-owned Villar Mir group said on Monday it has purchased 19.33 percent of bank-owned real estate company Colonial from Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>, at a price of 1 euro per share, for a total investment of 44 million euros.

Villar Mir, controlled by the chairman of Spanish builder OHL <OHL.MC>, agreed earlier this month to invest 300 million euros in Colonial. It was not clear whether the 44 million euros are part of this larger investment.
