SYDNEY, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Australian shares were set to firm on Wednesday, rebounding from its biggest single day decline in 3-1/2 months in the previous session, drawing support from Wall Street, which rose on better-than-expected retail figures.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.6 percent to 5,204.0, which is still an 8-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark fell 1.5 percent on Tuesday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> edged up 0.1 percent to 4,868.0 in early trade. * U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, erasing much of the previous session's steep drop, after a strong December retail sales reading eased concerns about an economic slowdown. * Copper dipped on Tuesday due to a firming dollar and caution over growth prospects for the world's top copper consumer China, but a shortfall of metal in the physical markets and upbeat U.S. data helped limit losses. * OZ Minerals Ltd <OZL.AX> said copper and gold productions were expected to increase in 2014, as the miner reported total copper production for December quarter of 18,119 tonnes versus 17,390 tonnes last quarter. [ID:nWNBS00A2N] * Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX>, BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd <FMG.AX> are set to report higher iron ore output for the December quarter after spending heavily to dig more mines in Australia.------------------ MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2204 GMT ------------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1,838.88 1.08%19.680 USD/JPY <JPY=>   104.19  -0.01%-0.010 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.8709  -- 0.046 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1,244.39-0.03%-0.320 US CRUDE<CLc1>   92.640.92% 0.840 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16,373.860.71%115.92 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  146.72   0.42%  0.62 -------------------------------------------------------------   * Wall St rebounds as sales point to healthy economy [.N] * U.S. oil up, Brent falls; spread narrows over $1   [O/R] * Gold falls as Wall St rises on U.S. retail sales data  [GOL/] * Copper falls on firm dollar, caution over China growth [MET/L]  DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
