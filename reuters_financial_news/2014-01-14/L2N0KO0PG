TORONTO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Canadian home prices edged up in December, reversing the loss seen the month before and returning the index to its all-time high, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index showed on Tuesday.

The index, which measures price changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed national prices rose 0.1 percent last month from November. Prices were up 3.8 percent from a year ago, an acceleration from November's 3.4 percent price gain.
