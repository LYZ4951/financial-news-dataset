Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Bharti Airtel  International (Netherlands) B.V's EUR250m 4% senior unsecured notes due 2018 a  rating of 'BBB-'. The notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by  India's Bharti Airtel Limited <BRTI.NS> (Bharti, BBB-/Stable) and are therefore rated at  the same level as Bharti's foreign-currency senior unsecured rating of 'BBB-'.  Bharti will use all the proceeds from the notes issue to refinance its existing  debt. The terms and conditions of the proposed bond are materially the same as  Bharti's existing guaranteed bond of EUR750m due 2018 and USD1.5bn due 2023. The  notes rank pari passu with the issuer's and guarantor's existing and future  senior unsecured indebtedness.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage to Improve: Bharti's funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net  leverage will improve to 2.6x-2.7x in the financial year ending March 2014  (FY14) from 3.0x in FY13 following an equity injection of USD1.3bn from Qatar  Foundation Endowment. This, along with free cash flow (FCF) generation, will  more than offset the addition of debt stemming from the acquisition of  Qualcomm's spectrum for USD1bn and the increase in leverage by 0.15x-0.2x due to  the 13% depreciation of the rupee during 1H14. Sustained Profitability: We expect Bharti's FY14 operating EBITDAR margin to  remain resilient at 31% (FY13: 30.9%) as the competitive landscape for its  Indian operations improves and the company gains market share in its African  operations. The Indian operations' profitability will improve as industry  overcapacity falls following the exit or contraction by smaller operators.  The profitability of its African operations will improve gradually (1H14  operating EBIDTAR margin: 26.7%), benefiting from increasing economies of scale  on a growing subscriber base and traffic minutes. In addition, the narrowing of  the tariff differential between off-net and on-net calls following a cut in  mobile termination rates in key African markets will improve Bharti's  profitability.  FCF to Fund Regulatory Costs: Fitch believes that Bharti's regulatory payments  are manageable given its ability to generate at least USD700m-USD800m in annual  FCF - which can fund its annual regulatory-related cash outflows. The regulatory  risk has reduced with a cheaper pan-India spectrum in an upcoming auction  (likely in January-February 2014) and the introduction of a flexible payment  mechanism for regulatory payments. The Indian government now provides an option  for regulatory payments to be phased over the life of the licence, instead of  upfront lump sums previously. Capex Could Surprise: Fitch believes that capex could rise over FY15-FY16 as  data traffic grows significantly in its Indian operations. Indian telcos'  average capex/revenue of 15%-17% is much lower than that for their Chinese and  Indonesian peers, which invest over 20% of their revenue. This is even though  Indian telcos face a greater shortage of spectrum compared with their Asian  peers. Bharti's FY14 capex guidance is USD2.1bn-2.2bn (15%-16% of FY14 revenue)  of which the company has invested only about USD750m during 1H14.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could individually or collectively lead to  negative rating actions include - A higher-than-expected regulatory charge or M&A activity resulting in  FFO-adjusted net leverage remaining above 2.5x on a sustained basis - A downgrade of India's 'BBB-' Country Ceiling
