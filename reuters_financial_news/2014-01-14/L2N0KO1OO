BOSTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - QFS Asset Management, which used a quantitative approach to global macro investing, said that it is shutting down after 26 years in the business, citing difficult market conditions.

The Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm, founded by economist Sandy Grossman, said in news release on Tuesday that it will return nearly $1 billion to clients by the end of the month. "The current market environment does not offer adequate risk adjusted opportunities for fundamentally-driven quant macro strategies, and that is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future," QFS Chief Executive Officer Karlheinz Muhr said in a statement. Muhr joined the firm as part of a merger in 2011. QFS becomes one of the new year's first hedge fund industry casualties after a difficult 2013 marked by generally lackluster returns. The Hedge Fund Research Inc's Macro index dipped 0.3 percent last year, making for a third consecutive year of declines. Macro funds bet on interest rate movements, currencies, and broad economic trends. At its heyday just before the financial crisis, QFS oversaw $3.6 billion in assets. Assets have shrunk despite some strong returns, people familiar with the fund said. QFS isn't alone in complaining about uncertain economic conditions and what managers perceive as a more difficult investing environment.
