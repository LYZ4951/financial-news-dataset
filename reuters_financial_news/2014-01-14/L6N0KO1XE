BELGRADE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank is likely to cut its benchmark rate for a fourth month running on Thursday, on low inflation, weak consumer and corporate demand, a stable dinar currency and fiscal consolidation plans, a Reuters poll showed.

Out of 14 traders and dealers polled by Reuters <RSKEY1>, 12 said they expected the bank's executive board to reduce the benchmark rate <RSDREPO=> on Jan. 16, while two said they expected no change.  Of the 12, nine expected a 25 basis points cut to 9.25 percent, which would still be the highest rate in the Balkans. Three forecast a deeper cut of 50 basis points.  Last month the bank cut the rate by 25 basis points to 9.5 percent, citing slowing inflation, a stable dinar and expectations of further government saving measures in 2014.  In an analysis on Tuesday, the Hypo Alpe-Adria bank said the central bank was likely to cut the rate by 25 basis points.  "More so, we do not fully exclude that the NBS (Serbia's central bank) cuts the policy rate by 50 basis points given its sizeable differential over inflation," it said.  Serbia's December inflation rose to 2.2 percent year-on-year in December, up from 1.6 percent a month earlier - still below the bank's 2014 target of 4 percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points. The Socialist-led government hopes wants to eke out 1 percent growth in 2014, depending on exports from its automotive and oil industries and agriculture.  It is also trying to secure a new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with talks expected in February or March. [ID:nL9N0IK008] Serbia's 2014 budget targets a shortfall of 4.6 percent of national output. But spending by municipalities, subsidies and sovereign guarantees for loss-making state companies could push the consolidated deficit to 7.1 percent of GDP. With public debt expected to have been 64.4 percent of GDP in 2013, more than the IMF recommends for such economies, the government has announced plans to cut public-sector wages and pensions.  To secure growth and trim the budget deficit, Serbia is seeking to sell or close loss-making state firms, amend laws on labour, privatisation and bankruptcy and improve collection of fiscal revenues. It also wants to end subsidies and sovereign guarantees for loss-making state firms.  On Tuesday, Sasa Radulovic, the economy minister, said that a failure of reforms which include changes to laws on labour, privatisation and bankruptcy could lead to early elections. [ID:nL6N0KO1GL] The Serbian dinar <EURRSD=D1>, which has been stable against the euro since October, has weakened since the beginning of the year, prompting the central bank to sell 20 million euros so far to stabilise the market.  "We see the EUR/RSD in narrow range these days as the dinar may find some support in carry trades ahead," the Hypo Alpe-Adria bank said.
