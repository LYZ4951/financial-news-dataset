MEXICO CITY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Retail and banking group Elektra paid $31 million for Blockbuster's video and games rental stores in Mexico and plans to add banking services to the locations, a senior executive at the company said on Tuesday.

Mexico's Elektra, owned by billionaire businessman Ricardo Salinas, will add financial services from its bank Banco Azteca to the stores, said Banco Azteca Chief Executive Luis Nino de Rivera in an interview. The Elektra-owned Blockbuster, which will retain that brand for two years, will also offer online video streaming services. "We think that what we have to do with Blockbuster is keep the business it already has and add high-tech products and services," he added. The sale of the Mexican assets comes after Blockbuster went into bankruptcy in 2010, battered by online and mail-order rental services that transformed how customers rent movies.. Dish Network <DISH.O>, which acquired Blockbuster in a bankruptcy auction in 2011, said in its third-quarter report that it put the Mexican unit up for sale. Dish wrote down its Blockbuster Mexico assets by $21 million, according to a regulatory filing. [ID:nL2N0KD128] Blockbuster in Mexico had sales of 2.2 billion pesos in 2012, Nino de Rivera said. The 320 Blockbuster stores cover 108 cities in Mexico and reach higher-earning segments of the population, which will help Elektra widen its client base, according to a statement. Nino de Rivera said Elektra is not taking on any debt as part of the 408 million pesos ($31.22 million) acquisition.
