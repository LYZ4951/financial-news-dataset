Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that  while pressure continues to mount for consolidation within Germany's highly  fragmented public-sector (PS) insurance sector, the prospect of mergers is  restricted by PS insurers' ownership structure. Because of their public ownership, Fitch believes that a merger of PS insurers  in the legal form of a stock company will be unlikely primarily as public  officials are not willing to tolerate the job losses that such mergers may  entail in their own region. A public-sector company would remain under public  control while a stock company could be divested, allowing offices to be closed. Further, because public-sector insurers operate in their own tightly defined  geographical regions, synergies from mergers are likely to be smaller than for  traditional insurers. Fitch believes that the resilience of PS life insurers to persistently low  investment yields is lower than the sector average because of limited earnings  diversification. Additionally, PS life insurers held a slightly lower level of  funds for future appropriation compared with the German life insurance sector  average at end-2012. Fitch believes that capital requirements after the  introduction of Solvency II are likely to be challenging for PS life insurers  because of their traditional product mix.  PS non-life insurers reported solid underwriting profitability and achieved an  average net combined ratio (CR) of 96.2% for 2008-12, which compares favourably  with the German market average of 97.1% despite their high market share in  German home insurance (the weakest line in underwriting profitability). However,  PS non-life insurers are likely to report weaker CRs than the sector average for  2013 because of their higher-than-average exposure to recent floods and  hailstorms.
