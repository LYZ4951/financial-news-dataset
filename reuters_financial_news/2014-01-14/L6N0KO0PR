STOCKHOLM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) said on Tuesday it would immediately withdraw the operating licence of credit firm Exchange Finans over failures in internal governance.

Exchange Finans' main business areas are money order redemption, foreign exchange and cash management. "The company has had serious deficiencies in its internal governance and control and has in particular neglected to take measures to prevent the operations from being used for money laundering and terrorist financing," the FSA said in a statement. "The company must therefore cease all operations with immediate effect."  The FSA said that in 2007 it had issued a warning to the company and imposed a fine, but that Exchange Finans had failed to rectify the problems identified then.   Exchange Finans has 250 employees in 25 offices around the country and had in 2012 assets of 598 million SEK and made a profit of 22 million before taxes.  Link to press release:
