Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> reported a 7.3 percent drop in quarterly profit after the biggest U.S. bank by assets paid penalties to the government for not reporting suspicions of fraud by Ponzi-schemer client Bernie Madoff.

Net income fell to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 per share, in the fourth quarter from $5.69 billion, or $1.39 per share in the same quarter of 2012, JPMorgan said on Tuesday. [ID:nBwq0R9Va]
