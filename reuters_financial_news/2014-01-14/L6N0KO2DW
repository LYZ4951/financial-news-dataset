STOCKHOLM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Sweden needs a road map for introducing countercyclical buffers for its banking system before spring, Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Tuesday.

The Nordic country is looking at ways to cool a red-hot housing market and Borg is keen for Sweden to implement such buffers to keep the banks in check. "During the coming months, before spring, that's on the agenda," he told journalists, without saying what the levels should be. Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) is planning to introduce countercyclical capital buffers around the middle of 2014. It has said the buffers will be somewhere in a range of 0-2.5 percent. In times of high credit growth, it will be at the higher end of the span and the FSA has used one percent in some of its base-case scenarios. Worries about a bubble in the Swedish housing market have been growing. Prices have nearly tripled over the last 15 years - in part due to a shortage of home building - and household debt levels are among the highest in Europe.
