Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The assessment of liquidity gaps and the  creditworthiness of the underlying pools could limit the uplift above the issuer  rating that is achievable for a new category of Italian covered bonds proposed  under changes to the country's covered bond law, Fitch Ratings says.  The new-style collateralised bank bonds would be dual recourse bonds similar to  obbligazioni bancarie garantite (OBG), but secured by assets currently not  eligible by law for OBG cover pools. These include corporate bonds, loans to  small and medium enterprises (SME), shipping loans, and lease and factoring  receivables, as well as tranches of securitisations backed by these assets.  The new bonds are outlined in Article 12 of Decree Law 145 (Destinazione  Italia), which adds new provisions to the existing Law 130/99 that governs  Italian covered bonds. They are intended to provide domestic banks with an  additional funding tool and encourage them to increase lending to companies.  Ratings assigned to the new debt instrument would reflect the difficulty of  bridging maturity mismatches between the cover assets and bonds, were any to  arise post-issuer default. In Fitch's view, the new asset types are less  tradable than those eligible for OBG. Therefore the typical soft bullet  redemption profiles of OBG rated by Fitch, which have a maturity date extension  of up to 15 months, would not result in the same notching differential if  applied to the collateralised bank bonds.  We expect the credit quality of the assets eligible for this debt instrument to  be worse or more volatile than those eligible for OBG. Depending on the  availability of performance data, this could either lead to higher breakeven  overcollateralisation levels for a given rating level or limit the potential  rating uplift of the new-style bond above the bank's Issuer Default Rating  (IDR). Our experience of rating Italian SME collateralised loan obligations and  leasing securitisation transactions suggests that comprehensive and detailed  historical data can be made available for these assets. But this is not always  the case for all asset classes. Insufficient information can cap the covered  bonds rating relative to the IDR. The decree law makes no reference to Bank of Italy instructions issued in 2007,  which specified that only banks meeting certain capital requirements can issue  covered bonds. This would suggest that issuance of the proposed new debt  instrument might be open to smaller lenders currently not eligible to issue OBG. The decree law would only become law if approved by the Italian Parliament  within 60 days of its publication in the Italian Official Gazette (ie before 21  February 2014). We will monitor developments and if the decree law is converted  into law, we will assess the revised legal framework when the secondary  legislation is finalised.
