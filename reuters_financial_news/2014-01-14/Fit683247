Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Northumbrian Water  Limited's [NWGTR.UL] (NWL) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', senior  unsecured rating at 'A-' and Short-term IDR at 'F2'. Northumbrian Water Finance  plc's [NWGFA.UL] (NWF) bonds, which benefit from an NWL guarantee, have been affirmed at  'A-'. The Outlook on NWL's Long-term IDR is Stable. The affirmation reflects the transparent regulatory framework in which NWL  operates, with revenue visibility until March 2015, the company's improving  operating & regulatory performance, and gearing in the mid-to-high 60%.  KEY RATING DRIVERS NWL's performance for the year to 31 March 2013 (FY13) relative to the targets  set by Ofwat, the economic regulator for the UK water sector, provides for solid  results, including meeting leakage targets and achieving stable asset  serviceability for all asset categories. Only repeat internal sewer flooding  incidents were above target, but this reflects an extremely wet year and this is  an area where many water & wastewater companies are having difficulties. NWL is  rephasing some capital expenditure to meet this regulatory output target. For FY13, NWL outperformed regulatory operating expenditure by just over GBP10m,  with savings in purchasing power at more favourable terms and efficiency gains  in procurement. This puts NWL in a strong position to achieve 1.4% annual  efficiency gains and additional cost challenges, including carbon reduction  commitment (CRC) and adoption of private sewer costs. Ofwat will modify the tariff-setting methodology for the price control period  from April 2015 to March 2020. The new totex (total expenditure) approach will  likely have companies look at opex solutions more carefully as an alternative to  large-scale capex projects, depending on long-term cost to deliver better  customer value. . There will be a greater focus on the customer, with the  companies being given the flexibility to deliver outcomes at lower cost and  manage risks through delivery incentives, leading to greater differentiation  within the sector. As water has been dragged into the political debate about  affordability, the new regulation will likely address the issues of tariffs for  the poorest customers. NWL's 2015-2020 business plan is based on a cost of capital (vanilla) of 4.2% -  which in turn is based on a real cost of debt of 2.3% - against 5.1% under the  price review 2009. If Ofwat takes a tough view of NWL's business plan, then the  credit rating could potentially be put at risk. While there will be additional  factors making up the achieved return, such as retail margins, NWL assumes  future efficiencies and the impact of AMP5 reconciliation adjustments will  offset cost increases. However, ahead of Ofwat making any material changes to  the business plan, it is difficult to judge the impact on NWL's credit profile  at this stage. Fitch forecasts post-maintenance and post-tax interest cover (PMICR) at around  1.7x for NWL and pension-adjusted net debt/regulatory asset value (RAV)  increasing to around 68.2% in FY15 from 65.4% in FY13, after adjusting for the  construction output price index. Fitch expects parent Northumbrian Water Group  to maintain pension-adjusted net debt/RAV at around 70%, excluding the Kielder  securitisation and project financing related to the non-regulated businesses.  These metrics are commensurate with Fitch's ratio guidelines for NWL's 'BBB+'  IDR. As at 30 September 2013, NWL had available GBP117.9m in cash and cash  equivalents. Undrawn, committed standby liquidity included GBP400m of capex  funding and GBP50m of working capital facilities with a July 2016 maturity.  These commitments provide sufficient liquidity for operating requirements and  debt maturities until the end of the price control period in March 2015.  NWL is the regulated monopoly water and wastewater company in northeast and  southeast England. It is owned by Northumbrian Water Group [UKWATN.UL], which also has a  number of other subsidiaries that pursue operating and maintenance contracts  related to water and wastewater operations. The group, which we view as a  standalone business reflecting regulatory and funding provisions, is ultimately  owned by a consortium, comprising Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Limited <1038.HK>  (A-/Rating Watch Negative), Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited <0001.HK> and Li Ka Shing  Foundation Limited.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: -A decrease in gearing at NWL to below low 60% respectively, and an increase in  NWL's PMICR to above 1.8x on a sustained basis  Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: -A tough view from Ofwat of NWL's 2015-2020 business plan
