MILAN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - In the current low-inflation environment, the European Central Bank can look at some of the instruments at its disposal to pursue its secondary mandate of lowering unemployment and fostering growth, European Central Bank Vice-President Vitor Constancio said.

"The treaty says that provided price stability is insured we should pursue other objectives, like unemployment and growth. Clearly there is a secondary mandate," Constancio said during a round table discussion in Milan.
