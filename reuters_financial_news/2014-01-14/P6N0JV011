PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - European stocks dropped in early trade on Tuesday, tracking sharp losses on Wall Street following a number of disappointing earnings and outlook statements that raised concern about profit growth.

Shares in German drugs distributor Celesio <CLSGn.DE> tumbled 7.7 percent after suitor McKesson <MCK.N> failed to get enough shares for its takeover bid to succeed. [ID:nWEB00GNG] At 0804 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top  European shares was down 1.1 percent at 1,310.50 points. Wall Street's S&P 500 <.SPX> slid 1.3 percent on Monday after a number of mid-sized companies posted weak earnings or forecasts. [.N] According to Thomson Reuters data, almost 10 out of every 11 companies that have had pre-announcements for the current earnings season from S&P 500 companies have lowered estimates. "We've been focusing a lot on macro data, but the real test is coming, with the earnings season starting, and the market might have been too optimistic about earnings recovery," a Paris-based equity and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trader said.
