Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published a sector-specific  criteria report describing its approach to rating transactions backed by  long-term charter and/or services agreements related to offshore vessels used in  different stages of the oil exploration and production (E&P) chain in Latin  America.  'Fitch believes this report will be useful for the regional marketplace given  investment in offshore production in Brazil and political commitment to offshore  waters development in Mexico,' said Cinthya Ortega, Director at Fitch Ratings.  Fitch rated the first transaction of this kind in 2010 and has published  numerous issuance-specific and special reports on its website. The new criteria report outlines the qualitative and quantitative factors  relevant to analyzing oil vessel-backed financings. Offshore vessels include  drilling rigs, Floating-Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units, and  shuttle tankers, among others.  Since contracts backing these transactions are the main source of cash flow  generation, the offtaker's credit rating acts as a cap to the transaction  rating, with few exceptions, according to 'Criteria for Rating Oil Vessel-Backed  Financing in Latin America,' now available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by  clicking on the link.  Ratings assigned to these transactions in Latin America have generally been  capped in the 'BBB' category.  While some of this has been driven by offtaker  credit quality and overall leverage, the main factors that influence this cap  are operating risks associated with the asset, potential technology risk, and  exposure of the asset value to long-term oil prices.   Additionally, the charter and/or services agreements backing these transactions  typically contain termination clauses related to the bankruptcy of the  operator/sponsor.  The degree of linkage between the transaction's rating and  the credit quality of the operator or sponsor is determined on a case by case  basis, as a function of (i) the asset type, (ii) the local supply and demand  fundamentals, (iii) the attractiveness of the asset to the offtaker, (iv)  contract characteristics, (v) available liquidity, and (vi) leverage and debt  service coverage metrics. Transaction ratings ultimately reflect the structural features designed to  mitigate performance risks, completion risk, refinancing risk, and the potential  for sale or relocation of the assets in the event of contract termination. Any  exposure to other counterparties and legal analysis are incorporated into the  analysis and reflected in the final rating.
