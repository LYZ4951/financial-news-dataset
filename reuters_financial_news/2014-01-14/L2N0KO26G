WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Five U.S. bank regulatory agencies on Tuesday approved a tweak to the Volcker rule that would allow banks to keep interests in certain funds backed by trust-preferred securities.

The change was aimed at easing small banks' concerns that they needed to dump certain investments they had previously thought would be allowed under the rule, losing money in the process. A bank trade group sued regulators over the dispute, and lawmakers from both parties have backed the banks.
