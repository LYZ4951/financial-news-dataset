NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - This earnings season is front-loaded, per usual, with financial companies, which bring out the big guns this week (JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, American Express, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs), at a time when valuations are under a bit more scrutiny for a few reasons.

For one, the outperformance of financial shares throughout 2013 has been based, in part, on expectations of more lending activity (not just in the shadow banking system, which has seen a pickup since 2012, according to KBW, but also in bank lending). Improved economic growth in the U.S. provides a bit of a lift as well, in terms of net interest margin to big lenders. Over the past 12 months, diversified financials have surged 38 percent, insurance names are up 40 percent, and banks 35 percent, so most industries in this sector - with real estate a noted exception - have been running strongly for some time.  And yet, per Goldman Sachs data, the financials sport a 14.4 price-to-earnings ratio, making it one of the less pricey of the 10 industry sectors in the S&P 500.  JP Morgan, the first out of the gate, has been consistent in exceeding estimates, beating 84 percent of the time, per Birinyi Associates, and the same goes for Goldman Sachs (87 percent) and Bank of America (73 percent), dating to 2003.  Starmine, to a man, sees these guys as undervalued across the board, with none of the big four even trading at their overall intrinsic value, which looks at the growth expectations 10 years out. So, what holds things back?  Well, revenue is nothing special. The sector is expected to post sales of $269.2 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $308 billion a year earlier, according to KBW, and particularly in the life and health insurance industries and industrial REITs sector, which would drag things down even further.  If anything, it's Wells Fargo that's set to buck the trend: The company has seen earnings estimates rise by 0.9 percent in the last 30 days, something the likes of JPM, Capital One, SunTrust, Citigroup and Bank of America haven't managed (they're all seeing estimates fall).
