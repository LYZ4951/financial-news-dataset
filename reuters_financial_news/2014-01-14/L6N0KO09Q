KUWAIT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Kuwait's government will continue a review of its spending on subsidies under a new cabinet appointed this month, the new finance minister said on Tuesday.

Anas al-Saleh said charging consumers more for state utilities was among options being considered, and that the government's subsidies review committee was expected to report its recommendations this year.
