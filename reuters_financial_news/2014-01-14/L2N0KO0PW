NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - As Wall Street's biggest banks report quarterly earnings this week, many will also offer a tiny glimpse into the scale of their commodity market activity through a measure of trading risk called VaR.

JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, the first to report, said on Tuesday its commodity markets Value-at-Risk (VaR) rose slightly in the fourth quarter, even as it prepared to sell its physical commodities trading business. Its VaR rose to $15 million in the fourth quarter, from $13 million, unchanged during the previous two quarters, and up $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. VaR is the most that can be lost on 95 percent of trading days within a given period. JPMorgan, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its commodities revenue under the fixed income category and does not break out the sector, often leaving VaR as one of its key risk-reward indicators that can measure commodities exposure. For the fourth quarter, fixed income revenue was $3.2 billion, down from $3.4 billion in the third quarter and in line with the fourth quarter of 2012.  The bank said in July it would sell its physical commodities business, and expects to complete a sale in the first quarter of 2014. The bank said it will retain its financial commodity trading business to serve client needs.
