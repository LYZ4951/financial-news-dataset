LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - French private equity firm PAI Partners has raised 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) - almost half of its target - for the first tranche of a new buyout fund after 10 months on the road, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Paris-based PAI, which is aiming to raise 3 billion euros in total, has benefited from a recovery in demand from U.S. and other international investors for exposure to Europe, where PAI focuses its investments, the source said.
