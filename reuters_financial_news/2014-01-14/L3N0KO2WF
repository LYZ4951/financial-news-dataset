MUMBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Tuesday led by declines in software exporters such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd <TCS.NS> on profit-taking after the recent run-up on better-than-expected quarterly results by peer Infosys Ltd. <INFY.NS>.

Falls also tracked weak global shares as a batch of weak earnings pre-announcements in the United States sparked concerns that the upcoming reporting season may disappoint, leaving some indexes looking expensive after a bumper 2013.[MKTS/GLOB] After India's retail inflation in December eased to a three-month low on Monday, traders are eyeing December wholesale price inflation, seen at 7 percent and due Wednesday, and considered to be key ahead of the central bank's rate review on Jan. 28.  Retail prices <INCPIY=ECI> rose an annual 9.87 percent last month, slower than expected, as vegetable prices fell, giving some relief to policymakers struggling to contain price pressures as growth hovers at a decade low. [ID:nL3N0KN29L] Also, a surprise contraction in industrial production and a slowdown in merchandise exports growth, which have dampened hopes of a rebound in Asia's third-largest economy, further reduces the chances of a rate hike, dealers said. [ID:nL3N0KK3WS] "Growth for India has bottomed out and even valuations look reasonable. Inflation has eased and I think a delay in rate action by the RBI governor signifies he may side with growth," said Nandkumar Surti, managing director and chief executive officer at JP Morgan Asset Management.

[ID:nWNBS00A04] Ranbaxy Laboratories <RANB.NS> fell 2 percent, adding to Monday's 5.4 percent slump, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raised concerns about manufacturing practices at one of its factories.
