PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - France's unemployment benefit fund said on Tuesday it expects its financial shortfall to widen further this year as joblessness keeps rising, driving its debt to a record level.

The further deterioration of UNEDIC's finances adds pressure on unions and employers ahead of talks starting on Friday about bringing its accounts back into the black. It said it expected 63,200 more workers to join the jobless register this year after 168,700 last year.  France's unpopular President Francois Hollande, who will lay out plans to make the economy more competitive in a press conference later on Tuesday, had pledged to get the country's unemployment rate on a downward trajectory by the end of last year. UNEDIC said its deficit would reach a record 4.3 billion euros ($5.9 billion), up from 4.0 billion euros last year. The forecast was down from a previous estimate of 4.4 billion euros. UNEDIC is financed directly by contributions from workers and employers, with any shortfall made up by borrowing. Because the state guarantees UNEDIC's bonds, its debt counts towards the total government debt. Unions and employers face tough talks to reduce UNEDIC's deficit with increased contributions a likely prospect as cutting benefits would be difficult to swallow in a period of high unemployment. The negotiations aim to bring UNEDIC's finances back into surplus so that it can begin paying off its debt, which it said was set to reach a record 22.1 billion euros this year, up from 17.8 billion euros in 2013.
