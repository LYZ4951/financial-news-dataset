Jan 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Developments in US Federal Reserve tapering and  financial regulation will weigh on the US tri-party repo market again in 2014,  Fitch Ratings says. The US tri-party repo market dropped USD257bn or 14% in  2013, largely as interest rate rises and regulation influenced volumes. Much  will depend on how interest rates move and how banks adjust to the Basel III  leverage ratio finalised on Sunday. The US tri-party repo market as a whole declined to USD1.61trn at end-2013  according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data published last week. Agency  MBS repo and to a lesser extent, Treasury, were the drivers of the fall. Agency  MBS repo fell by USD226bn or 28%, while Treasury repo fell 10%.  The interest rate sensitivity of the collateral means agency MBS and Treasury  repos were more affected as rates started to rise in May 2013 on the expectation  of tapering of quantitative easing. Valuation losses, amplified by the use of  leverage in repos, and resulting market volatility are likely to have  contributed to lower volumes. Agency MBS repo supply could also have been  affected by the precipitous drop in mortgage refinancing following the rate  pick-up, which adversely affected mortgage origination across the industry. The  interest rate environment will remain a source of uncertainty in 2014 affecting  incentives for repo market participants and the supply of repo collateral. Tougher financial market regulations and deleveraging in the financial sector as  institutions adjust to Basel III rules being phased in from 2014, have also hit  US tri-party repo volumes. Regulatory constraints on banks' trading activities,  including the Volcker Rule and more conservative Basel 2.5 market-risk capital  charges, may reduce their repo funding needs and their repo intermediation  services.  The Basel Committee's recently-proposed recognition of limited bilateral netting  within the leverage ratio could ease some of the regulatory capital pressures on  banks that participate actively in the repo market. However, the impact on repo  depends on how these changes are implemented. Minimum leverage ratio standards  have yet to be finalised by national regulators and could therefore vary across  jurisdiction. At the same time, systemic risk regulators have been focused on  curbing potential "fire sale" risks, in which repo funding disruptions could  have cascading effects across financial markets more broadly. This policy  uncertainty could shift the competitive landscape for repo activities. Volumes  could also migrate to the shadow banking sector and financial institutions not  subject to these rules.
