HANOI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.35 percent at the break on Tuesday, boosted by buying that lifted most blue chips and several property stocks.

Shares of steel manufacturer Hoa Phat <HPG.HM> rose 4.16 percent, while dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> and Hanoi-based lender Vietcombank <VCB.HM> each gained 0.73 percent. Investors also bought small-cap stocks in the real estate sector, said analyst Pham Van Khoa at Bao Viet Securities. Sacom Development and Investment Corp <SAM.HM> advanced 4.6 percent, and property firm Tan Tao Investment and Industry Group <ITA.HM> rose 1.56 percent.  The index might further rise this week before falling slightly from early next week as investors have been gradually shifting focus to penny stocks from blue chips, the main support for the market's gains in recent days, Khoa said.
