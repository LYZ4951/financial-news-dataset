SAO PAULO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - First Data Corp plans to enter Brazil's card payment processing market without resorting to a price war, indicating that soaring demand for plastic money in Latin America's largest economy will be enough for the U.S. firm to gain market share.

First Data will go into the $400 billion-a-year market in a joint venture with cooperative lender Banco Cooperativo do Brasil SA, executives at both companies told Reuters. Debbie Guerra, head of First Data's Brazil unit, expects the venture's acquiring platform to begin operations during the first half of 2014. The venture wants to grow in small- and mid-sized cities where Bancoob, as the cooperative bank is known, has the largest chunk of its 300,000 clients. Guerra and Marco Aurélio Almada, Bancoob's president, ruled out trimming merchant discount rates - the fees charged to retailers to settle transactions - to win customers from incumbent rivals. "We didn't set out to alter the economic reality of the merchant acquiring market," Almada said. "We don't see ourselves charging merchant discount rates different from the ones currently practiced in the market." The goal is to capture as much as 10 percent of Brazil's market for card payments in five years, Guerra added. First Data's decision to tap Brazil's buoyant acquiring sector comes as competition heats up and a secular migration from paper to electronic payment gains steam. According to industry group Abecs, the nation's card payment industry has grown an average 19 percent in the past five years, and could expand between 15 percent and 18 percent in coming years.  COMPETITION Both executives suggested that the ability to grow outside the largest metropolitan centers could be a powerful driver for growth. Brazil's card business covers about 30 percent of consumer spending - low compared to global peers, but higher than the rest of Latin America.  Results at Cielo SA <CIEL3.SA>, Brazil's largest merchant acquirer and the only one listed in Brazil, have been resilient over the past three years, despite cooling consumption and below-trend economic growth, with billings outgrowing the overall economy. Analysts such as Carlos Macedo of Goldman Sachs Group Inc are forecasting competition to increase this year, driven by a more aggressive posture by Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and new entrants - such as First Data. Itaú <ITUB4.SA>, Brazil's most profitable bank, gobbled up Redecard SA and integrated it into a consumer finance platform to gain market share from Cielo. In recent years, Citigroup Inc <C.N> and Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA> have also ramped up their acquiring units in Brazil to take advantage of a surge in card payments.
