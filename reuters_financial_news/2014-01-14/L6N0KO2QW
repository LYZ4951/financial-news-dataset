JOHANNESBURG, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Standard Chartered <STAN.L> said on Tuesday its private equity arm has taken a 13 percent stake in Botswana-listed supermarket chain Choppies Enterprises <CHOPP.BT>, the latest private equity deal to target African consumers.

London-listed Standard Chartered did not disclose the acquisition price, but Choppies has a market value of $456 million, according to Thomson Reuters data, which would make the stake worth nearly $6 million. Fast-growing Africa is increasingly seen as fertile ground for private equity firms, given rapid economic growth and rising consumer spending.  Sub-Saharan capital markets are largely illiquid, apart from a few major centres such as Johannesburg and Nairobi, making private equity one of the few vehicles for investing in African companies. Choppies, the largest retailer in diamond-producing Botswana, operates more than 100 supermarkets and has operations in South Africa and Zimbabwe.
