MUMBAI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Wednesday, recovering from one-month lows and snapping a three-day losing streak, as recent underperformers such as State Bank of India <SBI.NS> gained on value-buying while a firmer trend across the region also helped.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally rose 0.12 percent to 27,831.10, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 0.18 percent higher at 8,355.65.
