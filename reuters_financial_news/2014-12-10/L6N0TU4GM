ROME, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The former president of the Vatican bank, Angelo Caloia, has resigned from the positions he held at the Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, Intesa said on Wednesday.

The announcement came four days after Reuters reported that assets belonging to Caloia and two other people had been frozen as part of an investigation into the sale of Vatican-owned real estate in the 2000s. [ID:nL6N0TQ0D3] It was not clear if Caloia's resignation was connected with the report. It was not immediately possible to reach Caloia or Intesa for comment.
