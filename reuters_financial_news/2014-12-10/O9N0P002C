OSLO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Norway's $860 billion oil fund has lifted its investment ban on Dongfeng Motor Group Co <0489.HK> and will no longer keep Randgold Resources Ltd. <RRS.L> on observation for possible exclusion, the finance ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

The government regularly reviews the oil fund's investments and puts companies either on a watch list or excludes them from the fund's portfolio if the ministry's ethics council observes ethical violations in the firms' operations.
