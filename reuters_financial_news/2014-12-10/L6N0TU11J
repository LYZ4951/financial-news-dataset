LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Greece's short-term borrowing costs jumped further above longer-term equivalents on Wednesday, a tell-tale sign that investors fear political uncertainty in Athens could put the country back on the road towards default.

The move follows a sharp sell-off on Tuesday after Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras brought forward a presidential vote, a gamble that if fails, could catapult the leftist anti-bailout Syriza party to power. [ID:nL6N0TT2IY]   This is an outcome feared by bondholders who prefer pro-business governments that stick to the rigours of the IMF/EU bailout programme. Yields on Greek three-year bonds <GR3YT=RR> shot up more than 100 basis points to 9.3 percent, the highest level since the bonds were issued back in July, and above equivalent 10-year yields which rose 15 basis points to 8.22 percent <GR10YT=RR>. "This inversion tells you that there is concerns about further potential debt writedowns, and that is a function of minds being focused on Syriza which would no doubt push hard for such a policy," said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor. Greece agreed a debt swap deal with its creditors in 2012 in exchange for receiving the second tranche of its 240 billion euro bailout. Most of its outstanding debt - which is around 175 percent of GDP - is held by these official creditors, but analysts say this may not prevent private investors from escaping future debt restructurings. Greece has sold two new bonds via capital markets in 2014, a five-year in April and the three-year in July. Finance ministers of the 18 euro zone countries, known together as the Eurogroup, on Monday supported a two-month technical extension of Greece's bailout programme and the granting of a precautionary credit line for Athens afterwards. The EU's economics chief also said late on Tuesday Samaras' decision to bring forward the vote showed he was confident he could win. [ID:nL6N0TT3LE]But the political uncertainty has shaken markets. If Samaras fails to secure victory for his presidential candidate, snap national elections could be called that Syriza would likely win.
