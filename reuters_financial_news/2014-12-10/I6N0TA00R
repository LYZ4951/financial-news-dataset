MILAN, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Bank loans to companies in Italy fell in October for the 30th straight month, as lenders saddled with a huge stock of bad loans are more selective than in the past in lending and the country's stagnating economy depresses corporate investments.

The Bank of Italy said on Wednesday bank loans to non-financial firms fell 3.1 percent from a year earlier in October, after a 3.3 percent fall in September. Bank lending to companies has been contracting since May 2012.
