LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to Ukrainian debt rose to its highest level in 5-1/2 years on Wednesday, according to data from financial information provider Markit, as fears mounted the country will have to restructure debt.

Ukraine's 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) rose more than 200 basis points from Tuesday's close, to 2,026 bps, a level last seen in mid-2009.  One-year CDS stood at 3,563 on Wednesday, Markit said. Ukraine's new economy minister, Aivaras Abromavicius, said on Wednesday the government wanted the International Monetary Fund to expand its $17 billion bailout package due to Ukraine's worsened economic outlook.
