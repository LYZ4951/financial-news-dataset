Dec 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday that 618,548 individuals selected a 2015 health plan on HealthCare.Gov during the week of Nov. 29 to Dec. 5, of which 48 percent were consumers who had not previously purchased this insurance.

HealthCare.gov is a website created under the national healthcare reform law that sells health plans to individuals and provides income-based subsidies. Enrollment opened for 2015 plans on Nov. 15. More than 7 million people signed up for this insurance in 2014 and the government expects more than 9 million to enroll in 2015. Since Nov. 15, 1,383,683 people have signed up for plans and of them, more than 664,000 were new consumers who did not previously have a plan, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on its website.
