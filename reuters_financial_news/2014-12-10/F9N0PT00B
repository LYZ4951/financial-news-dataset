TALLINN, Dec 10 (Reuters) - It is too early to say whether the European Central Bank's January policy meeting will be too soon to decide on whether the bank should start buying sovereign bonds, ECB policymaker Ardo Hansson said on Wednesday.

"I think the fluctuation in the oil price makes the de-trending or understanding the underlying trends a bit more tricky," Hansson told reporters in Tallinn. "The thing is that headline inflation is moving around a bit, but ... I think every time you come together you look at a range of factors," he added. "You analyse risks and the effects of different measures, you revisit the medium-term inflation outlook and come to a decision. Whether is it early or not too early (to decide in January) is at this point I think too early to tell."
