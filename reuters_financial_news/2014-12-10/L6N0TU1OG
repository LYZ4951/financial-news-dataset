LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Greece's short-term borrowing costs ballooned on Wednesday, rising further above long-term rates in a sign that investors fear political upheaval in Athens could put the country back on the road to default.

The move follows a sharp sell-off on Tuesday after Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras brought forward a presidential vote, a gamble that if fails, could catapult the leftist anti-bailout Syriza party to power. [ID:nL6N0TT2IY]   This is an outcome feared by bondholders who prefer pro-business governments that stick to the rigours of the IMF/EU bailout programme which has been extended until early next year. Yields on Greek three-year bonds shot up over 130 basis points to 9.64 percent, the highest level since the bonds were issued back in July, and above equivalent 10-year yields which rose 59 basis points to 8.70 percent <0#GRTSY=TWEB>.

The cost of insurance on five-year Greek bonds rocketed 100 bps, credit default swap prices from Markit showed. Greece agreed a debt swap deal with its creditors in 2012 in exchange for receiving the second tranche of its 240 billion euro bailout. Most of its outstanding debt - which is around 175 percent of GDP - is held by these official creditors, but analysts say this may not prevent private investors from escaping future debt restructurings. Athens issued five- and three-year bonds in the capital markets earlier this year, its first since default.   WORSE AHEAD? The political uncertainty has shaken other markets from Greek stocks to other lower-rated euro zone bonds. If Samaras fails to secure support for his presidential candidate, snap elections could be called that Syriza would likely win. Portuguese 10-year yields <PT10YT=TWEB> were 9 bps higher at 2.93 percent, while Italian and Spanish equivalents rose 5 bps to 2.08 <IT10YT=TWEB> and 1.87 percent <ES10YT=TWEB>. Athens <.ATG> was the worst performing stock market in Europe. [.EU]  German bonds, which fall in times of uncertainty as investors seek refuge in top-rated assets, dipped 1 bps to a new record low of 0.673 percent <DE10YT=TWEB>. The EU's economics chief tried to quell market panic on Tuesday, saying Samaras' decision to bring forward the vote showed he was confident he could win. [ID:nL6N0TT3LE]But with the vote to be held over three rounds, and the government most likely to win at its last attempt on Dec. 29 where it requires a smaller majority, market jitters are likely to continue in the weeks ahead. Citi's global rates strategy head, Alessandro Tentori, said the timing of the sell-off was also unfortunate as very few investors will look to add risk as they prepare accounts for year-end reporting.
