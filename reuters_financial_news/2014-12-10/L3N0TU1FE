WELLINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged as expected on Thursday, but signalled that further rate hikes were still likely at a later stage, sending the New Zealand dollar sharply higher.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held its official cash rate at 3.50 percent for the third consecutive policy review, having tightened monetary policy by a total of 100 basis points between March and July. All 16 economists polled by Reuters had expected no change to rates, with a majority seeing rates on hold at least until the third quarter of next year before a resumption of tightening. [NZ/POLL] **************************************************************** KEY POINTS: - RBNZ says further rate rises will be needed, to return to neutral level. - RBNZ will assess policy, inflation outlook to set pace of tightening - RBNZ wholesale interest rate forecasts imply no OCR rises before late 2015   - RBNZ says NZ dlr level still unjustifiable, unsustainable, expects further significant depreciation - RBNZ says NZ growth to remain solid around 3 pct next two years - RBNZ says inflation seen lower for longer, but will rise as growth continues - RBNZ says dairy price slide a risk to growth   - RBNZ says softening in major economies apart from U.S. seen, expects supportive monetary policies for longer - For text of the RBNZ statement click on [ID:nZZN00C000]  COMMENTARY: SU-LIN ONG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS "The statement is not as dovish as some were expecting. There had been thoughts the RBNZ would shift to a clear neutral stance, but instead it kept the tightening bias intact. "Still, we suspect it's a mild bias that is very conditional on how the economy pans out. We believe the activity data will disappoint in coming months so that a hike gets pushed out farther and farther into the future. In particular, there's no way inflation is going to get back to the mid-point of the target anytime soon. In all, the RBNZ may already be done with this tightening cycle."  MARKET REACTION:  The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> rose to $0.7805 from around $0.7685 before the announcement, while interest rate futures <0#NBB:> also rose.  LINKS:  BACKGROUND: - The RBNZ has been hold after raising its Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent in July, making a total of 1 percentage point rise in the rate from March after being on hold at a record low 2.5 percent for three years. - In the October statement the RBNZ removed its previous explicit comment about further rate rises being needed. The RBNZ has said it sees the neutral level for the cash rate at between 4.5 to 5 percent. - Financial market pricing based on swaps <CSSY> put 2 percent chance of a rate rise in this review, with 8 basis points of rises seen over the coming year. - Annual inflation was 1.0 percent in the third quarter. The RBNZ has said it aims to keep inflation around the middle of its 1-3 percent target band. [ID:nL6N0SH04S] - Annual CPI is seen holding below target for much of next year because of slower economic growth, cheaper fuel costs, which along with global uncertainty will keep the RBNZ on hold for longer. - The New Zealand economy grew 0.7 percent in Q2, taking the rate to a decade high 3.9 percent for the year to June 30. [ID:nL3N0RH2BB] - Dairy giant Fonterra has cut its forecast payout for the current season to NZ$4.70 a kilo of milk solids compared with NZ$8.40 payout last year, because of a near-50 percent fall in global prices. The reduced forecast equates to a NZ$6 billion knock to economic growth. - The trade-weighted New Zealand dollar <=NZD>, the RBNZ's preferred currency measure, has fallen more than 6 percent from a post-float high hit in mid-July and is about 2 percent below the bank's September forecast. - NZ's key rate compares with Australia's 2.5 pct, 0-0.1 pct in Japan, 0.05 pct in the euro zone, and 0-0.25 pct in the United States. [GLOBAL/INT] - The RBNZ's next cash rate review will be on Jan 29.
