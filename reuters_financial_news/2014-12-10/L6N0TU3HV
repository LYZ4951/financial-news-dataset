HONG KONG, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Singaporean offshore oil and gas services firm Ezra Holdings <EZRA.SI> is increasing an existing five-year loan to $403 million and extending its maturity although two lenders refused to increase commitments due to concerns about the oil price, bankers said.

Ezra guaranteed the original $273 million loan, which was signed in May 2012 and financed the construction of a new ship, the Lewek Constellation, and the new $130 million increase which finances the purchase of advanced equipment for the ship.  The increased $403 million loan is now due to mature in 2020. The facility is currently in documentation and is expected to sign in December, sources said. Oil services companies are bearing the brunt of the collapse in the value of the benchmark Brent crude, which has tumbled 40 percent since June and edged down to $66.50 a barrel on Tuesday compared with $115 in the summer. Ezra and its subsidiaries operate in more than 16 locations globally and provide integrated offshore support for the oil and gas industries. Ezra's share price has tumbled 62 percent from a 52-week high of $1.46 Singapore dollars in December 2013, to 0.55 Singapore dollars on Wednesday.  Ezra has been one of the companies hit hardest by the falling price of oil with a deepwater focussed fleet, its subsea segment with exposure to the North Sea and delayed project awards, according to a research report by OCBC Investment Research on Nov. 26. "Ezra's share price has been dipping and the oil price too. Lenders do not feel optimistic about the company's prospects," a banker familiar with the situation said.   AUGUST REQUEST Lenders were asked to increase, amend and extend Ezra's existing loan in August. Other changes included increasing the loan to value ratio to 77 percent from 65 percent to allow the company to borrow more and changing the repayments accordingly.  All of the lenders initially agreed the changes, but two banks subsequently refused to increase existing commitments due to the negative effect of the decline in the oil price and Ezra's sliding equity price on the credit risk, sources said. "Deepwater drilling has a higher cost than land drilling. With the oil price drop, the company's profitability will fall as well. Lenders do not feel motivated to invest further," said another loan banker involved in the deal. This forced the lead banks - mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners DBS and DNB - to increase their commitments to meet the shortfall on the new $130 million piece, bankers said. Both banks held $91.5 million of the original loan before the increase. DNB is the agent bank. Ezra and DBS were not immediately available and DNB declined to comment.   Other lenders in the deal are Bank of Taiwan, Caterpillar Finance Corp, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank and Maybank International.  Caterpillar Finance Corp and Maybank International held $35 million each of the existing deal prior to the increase, and Bank of Taiwan and Chang Hwa Commercial Bank had $10 million each. The loan pays a margin of 325 basis points (bp) and lenders will receive a fee of 100bp for the additional commitments.
