LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil-rich Angola's sovereign wealth fund has set aside $1.6 billion to establish vehicles that will back infrastructure and hotel projects across sub-Saharan Africa, the fund said on Wednesday.

In an investment update for the three months to September 30, the Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) said its net value currently stands at $4.95 billion, compared with $5 billion it was initially endowed by the government, a process completed in June. The FSDEA said it is investing $1.1 billion in an infrastructure fund that will focus on equity investments in energy, transport and industrial projects in Angola and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. It has also allocated $500 million to a Hotel Fund for Africa, aiming to address a "significant undersupply" of top-end hotels in the continent.
