LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Greece's short-term borrowing costs climbed above long-term rates on Wednesday, a sign that investors fear political upheaval in Athens could push the country back towards default.

The move follows a sell-off on Tuesday after Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras brought forward a presidential vote, a gamble that could end up catapulting into power the leftist party Syriza, which opposes Greece's bailout agreement. [ID:nL6N0TT2IY]   Bondholders would prefer a pro-business government that will stick to the IMF/EU bailout programme, which has been extended until early next year. Yields on Greek three-year bonds jumped over 130 basis points to 9.85 percent, the highest since the bonds were issued in July. Ten-year yields rose just 65 basis points to 9.025 percent <0#GRTSY=TWEB>.

Syriza holds a five-point lead over the ruling conservatives, according to the first poll published since Samaras moved up the presidential vote.

The cost of buying protection against a Greek default using a five-year credit default swap rocketed 100 bps, CDS  prices from Markit showed. Greece agreed a debt swap deal with its creditors in 2012 in exchange for receiving the second tranche of its 240 billion euro bailout. Most of its outstanding debt - which is around 175 percent of GDP - is held by the official creditors, but analysts say that may not protect private investors from any future debt restructurings. Athens issued five- and three-year bonds in the capital markets earlier this year, its first since default.   WORSE AHEAD? The political uncertainty has shaken other markets, from Greek stocks to other lower-rated euro zone bonds. If Samaras fails to secure support for his presidential candidate, snap elections could be called that Syriza would be likely to win. Portuguese 10-year yields <PT10YT=TWEB> were 14 bps higher at 2.98 percent. The Italian and Spanish equivalents rose 6 bps to 2.08 <IT10YT=TWEB> and 1.88 percent <ES10YT=TWEB>. Athens <.ATG> was the worst-performing stock market in Europe. [.EU]  German bonds, which fall in times of uncertainty as investors seek refuge in top-rated assets, dipped 1 bp to a record low of 0.673 percent <DE10YT=TWEB>. The EU's economics chief tried to quell market fears on Tuesday, saying Samaras's decision to bring forward the vote showed he was confident he could win.
