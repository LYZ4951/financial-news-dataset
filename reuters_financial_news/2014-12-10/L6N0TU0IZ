MOSCOW, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Wednesday it had conducted $400 million worth of forex market interventions on Dec. 8. This follows $4.53 billion in interventions last week.

The Russian currency has been sliding on falling oil prices, an economic slowdown and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis that have restricted Russian firms' access to international capital.
