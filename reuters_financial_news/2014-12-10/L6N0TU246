LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - More than 40,000 British borrowers are in line to get thousands of pounds in compensation after London's High Court ruled against former bank Northern Rock in a test case over how past loan documents were phrased.

The High Court judgment said the ruling could cost Northern Rock Asset Management about 258 million pounds ($405 million) in compensation to 41,000 customers.  NRAM is the former "bad bank" of Northern Rock that was nationalised in 2008 and is now part of UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), a state-run 'zombie bank' that does not take on new business.
