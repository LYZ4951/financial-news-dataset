WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday it was pleased that U.S. lawmakers appeared to be coming together on a budget proposal that would avoid a government shutdown.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest called it a "compromise proposal" and declined to say whether President Barack Obama would sign the measure if it passes Congress.
