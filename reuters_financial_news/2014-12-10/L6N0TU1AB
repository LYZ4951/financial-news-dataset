PARIS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Fosun International <0656.HK>, controlled by billionaire Guo Guangchang, is set to raise its offer for French holiday group Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> to outbid Italian tycoon Andrea Bonomi, The Financial Times reported.

"We are going with a new offer," Guo's Brazilian investment partner Nelson Tanure told the newspaper, adding that Guo and his partners planned to list Club Med in Hong Kong and Brazil. Club Med is suffering from tough competition, weak growth in Europe where it does most of its business, and a stalled attempt to take itself upmarket. Bonomi raised his bid for Club Med to 24 euros a share on Dec. 5, trumping Guo's 23.50 euros offer, and valuing the loss-making holiday firm at 915 million euros ($1.13 billion). [ID:nL6N0TP1UU] It is the seventh offer its investors have been asked to consider since May last year when Guo's investment vehicle Gaillon Invest II offered a low-ball 17 euros a share.  Club Med shares were up 1.15 percent at 24.68 euros by 0935 GMT, above Bonomi's offer. Guo and Bonomi see turnaround potential and growth prospects in emerging markets, especially China. Club Med's management has consistently supported Guo's offer. A Fosun spokeswoman declined to comment, other than to say the conglomerate was reviewing the situation. Fosun has until Dec. 19 at 1700 GMT to outbid Bonomi. Tanure would take a 20 percent stake in Club Med by investing in Gaillon, the Chinese investment firm has said.
