Dec 10 (Reuters) - The judge in the bankruptcy case for the city of Stockton, California, denied a motion by a holdout creditor that would slightly increase the amount it would receive on its claim.

Attorneys for Franklin Templeton Investments had filed a motion for a stay pending appeal of a ruling by the judge in October that confirmed the city's plan to exit Chapter 9 protection. [ID:nL2N0T42W2] In the city's plan, Franklin would receive just over $4 million of the $36 million it said it is owed. The remaining $32 million of the total was considered unsecured, for which Franklin would receive less than a penny on the dollar. That is in line with what city retirees are set to receive for their healthcare benefits. The city's plan of adjustment, a kind of blueprint for the city to exit bankruptcy, eliminated future health benefits for retirees, an estimated savings of $545 million for the city. Franklin argued that the true savings of retiree health benefits was $261.9 million, if the claim was discounted to present day value, which would double Franklin's return on its unsecured claim by more than $300,000. But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Klein said he was not required to discount the claim and denied Franklin's request.
