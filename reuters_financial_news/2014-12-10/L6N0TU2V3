COPENHAGEN, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Huge tax revenues will reduce Denmark's borrowing needs, its central bank's governor, Lars Rohde, said after the tax ministry announced the state had received 80 billion Danish crowns ($13.4 billion) from Danes thanks to a pension tax incentive.

The Central Bank is expected to publish its strategy for the first half of 2015 of buying and issuing of state bonds. "The sale of state bonds will be reduced in the long run when the state is collecting as much money as we have seen with the tax on capital pensions", Rohde told Reuters. Danes have taken advantage of the government's offer to deduct their tax bill by 2.7 percent if they pay tax on capital pensions in 2013, 2014 and in 2015, but not later. The incentive has already boosted the budget to keep the gap within a 3 percent of gross domestic forecast limit set by the European Union. Up to now over two million Danes have generated the 80 billion crowns in additional state coffers. The central bank now sees a budget surplus this year of 33 billion crowns or 1.7 percent of GDP, the first since 2008. The central banks expects a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2015, a cut in its previous 3.2 percent forecast, thanks to an additional 15 billion crowns in revenues from the tax.
