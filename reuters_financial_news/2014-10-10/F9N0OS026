FRANKFURT, Oct 10 (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny would not rule out forever a policy of quantitative easing, or printing money to buy government bonds, he said.

"I think there might be (a role for QE) within the limits of our mandate. This is one possible approach - but one has to discuss it in detail, of course," MNI quoted him as telling reporters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Thursday.
