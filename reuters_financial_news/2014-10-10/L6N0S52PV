BRUSSELS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A Luxembourg court on Friday declared two holding companies of Portugal's Espirito Santo family bankrupt.

The court this meant that the companies concerned, Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESTL.LU> and its subsidiary Espirito Santo Financiere [ESTLF.UL], had ceased payments and that they no longer had access to credit. ESFG is Banco Espirito Santo's <BES.LS> largest shareholder, and is controlled by the bank's founding Espirito Santo family.
