MOSCOW, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Friday it had shifted the boundaries of its floating rouble corridor by 15 kopecks,  following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline.

As of Oct. 9, the new corridor extended from 36.00 to 45.00 against a dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX>, compared with 35.85 to 44.85 previously.
