Oct 10 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico will pursue "all legal options available" to appeal a court ruling that favored Doral Financial Corp <DRL.N> in a $229 million tax dispute, Treasury Secretary Melba Acosta Febo said on Friday.

In a statement, the Treasury Secretary said she disagreed with the ruling. "The refund payment of over $200 million, which according to the 2012 agreement is to be paid in five installments over a five year period, will remain contested by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico until appeal processes within the judiciary system are resolved."
