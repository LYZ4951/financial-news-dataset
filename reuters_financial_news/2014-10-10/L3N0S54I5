Oct 10 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox <FOXA.O> and Apollo Global Management LLC <APO.N> agreed to combine three of their TV production companies behind hit shows such as "Big Brother", "American Idol" and "Masterchef" under one group.

The companies said they would set up a joint venture to hold Apollo-controlled Endemol and Core Media and Fox's Shine Group. Fox and Apollo would each own 50 percent of the new entity. Shine Group's popular shows include "Masterchef", "The Biggest Loser" and "Minute to Win It". Apollo's Endemol owns reality TV show formats such as "Big Brother", "Wipeout" and "Deal or No Deal" and its Core Media unit owns "American Idol" and "So You Think You Can Dance". The group's businesses will operate in over 30 markets and include 600 scripted and reality TV shows, the companies said in a statement.
