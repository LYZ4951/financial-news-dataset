COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Tryg <TRYG.CO>, the Nordic region's second-biggest general insurer, posted third-quarter earnings slightly above expectations and maintained its financial targets on Friday. [ID:nL6N0S50CJ]

Chief executive Morten Hubbe made the following comments in a telephone interview with Reuters:  "The top line declined 0.8 percent compared with same quarter last year but it is the best quarter in two years (in terms of least amounts lost). Premium income rose in Denmark and Norway but fell 8.4 percent in Sweden as a result of the termination of the Nordea agreement."  "We want the top line to increase in line with inflation."  "The takeover of an agricultural portfolio from Codan in the second quarter of 2014 tell us we can strengthen our position in the market, provide attractive offers to customers and improve the bottom line. It's a good example to follow."  "The third quarter has been quite challenging. A big storm in August resulted in 2,500 more claims and weather-related claims increased 150 million Danish crowns ($26 million). On top of that the financial markets have been sour. Despite that we have delivered a strong result."  "The Danish Meteorological Institute recently concluded in a report that the risk of flooding of basements will double in coming years. We have to take that into account."
