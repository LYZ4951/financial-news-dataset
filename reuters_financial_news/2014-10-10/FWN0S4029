LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Jupiter Fund Management <JUP.L> said assets under management (AuM) dropped to 31.7 billion pounds ($51.12 billion) in the September quarter from 33.1 billion at the end of June.

The money manager said the outflows were fuelled by the withdrawal of 2.2 billion pounds by private clients.
