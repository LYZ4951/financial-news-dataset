NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley <MS.N> said on Friday that there is "no assurance" a deal to sell its physical oil trading business to Russian oil company Rosneft will close.

The Wall Street bank cited a contractual requirement to get regulatory approvals by year end, and said it "would consider a variety of options" if deal does not close. The news follows a Reuters report last month that Rosneft might back out of the deal because Western sanctions had hurt its ability to finance the operations. A key U.S. regulatory committee has asked the two parties for more information about the deal, but did not approve or reject it. [ID:nL2N0RQ0KT]
