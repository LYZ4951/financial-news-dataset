MILAN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Italy's bourse suspended trading in Mediolanum <MED.MI> after shares in the asset manager dropped nearly 5 percent following news that Fininvest, the holding company of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, must significantly cut its stake.

Fininvest has a stake of around 30 percent in Mediolanum. In a statement on Thursday it said the Bank of Italy and insurance regulator Ivass had instructed it to cut its stake to no more than 9.9 percent.
