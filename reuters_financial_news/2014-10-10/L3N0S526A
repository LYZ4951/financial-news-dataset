SEOUL, Oct 10 (Reuters) - South Korean shares tumbled on Friday, hovering just above a near 7-month intraday low hit late in the session, as weak German economic data stoked worries over slowing global growth.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> fell 1.24 percent to close at 1,940.24 points. It was down 1.8 percent for the week. The South Korean won <KRW=> was firmer on Friday, with investors trimming bullish bets on the dollar after a dovish tone was detected in the latest U.S Federal Reserve minutes.  The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,070.5 to the dollar at the conclusion of onshore trade, compared with Wednesday's close of 1,074.1.
