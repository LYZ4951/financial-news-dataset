PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Germany's DAX index <.GDAXI> sank to a near one-year low on Friday, knocked down by rising worries about the strength of Europe's biggest economy following a raft of bleak macro data.

The index fell 1.1 percent to 8,904.29 points, piercing below its August low and falling to levels not seen since late October 2013. The DAX - which has been the euro zone's best-performing stock index in the five years since Lehman Brothers collapsed - is lagging all other major markets so far this year, losing 6.7 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> is down 1 percent. http://link.reuters.com/pap87v
