SHANGHAI, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Chinese money rates rose slightly this week on cash demand from banks to meet regulatory requirements, but sufficient liquidity supply kept gains limited.

Chinese banks usually need to set aside reserves to meet policy requirements on the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month. Because of the National Day holiday during Oct. 1-7, the date had been pushed back to Oct. 8. Traders were optimistic about liquidity conditions in the near term after authorities reiterated that they would maintain targeted monetary policy.  The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.05 percent at midday on Friday, up 14 basis points (bps) from 2.91 percent at the close on Tuesday last week, the last trading day before the holiday. The 14-day rate <CN14DRP=CFXS>, another actively traded tenor, was at 3.31 percent, edging up only 1 bp, while the overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> inched up 3 bps on the week to 2.56 percent. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected a net 26 billion yuan ($4.24 billion) into money markets this week in its regular open market operations, reversing from a net drain the previous week, keeping liquidity in the market relatively ample. [CN/MMT] With a number of major political events in the pipeline, such as a party plenary session in late October, the PBOC is expected to ensure sufficient money supply for the rest of October, traders said.  "A round of company tax payments late this month might add pressure on money rates, but we are not worried about it," said a dealer at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai. She added big banks are now more willing to lend out money after the PBOC issued 500 billion yuan of three-month loans via its Standing Lending Facility (SLF) last month.
