WARSAW, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Warsaw-listed real-estate developer Globe Trade Centre (GTC) <GTCP.WA> could carry out a share buy-back with some of the income from a planned share issue, it said on Friday.

Last month, the firm said it wanted to offer up to 140 million new shares to existing shareholders, who will vote on the plan on Oct. 13. Current owners will be entitled to one new share for every share they will have on Dec. 16. [ID:nL6N0RG1MV] The issue will increase the total number of shares by 40 percent, with the main aim to fund acquisitions in Poland and eastern Europe. If within 18 months after the issue GTC has invested less than 90 percent of the income, whatever is left would be spent on a buy-back, the company said. The buy-back price per share would not be lower than the issue price. Shares in GTC, 30 percent owned by private equity firm Lone Star, closed at a one-month high on Thursday, valuing the issue at 809 million zlotys ($246 million). The stock has rebounded from its lowest level since June 2012, hit last month, on news of the issue. GTC, which targets commercial real estate, wants to focus on assets in Poland and the capital cities around central and southeastern Europe.  Earlier this year, the firm - eastern Europe's largest listed real estate developer - told Reuters it may spend up to 100 million euros ($127 million) on property assets, but had no plans to buy a company in Poland.
