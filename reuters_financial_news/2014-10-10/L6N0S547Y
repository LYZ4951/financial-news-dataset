LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Finnish IT firm Tieto <TIE1V.HE> and European private equity firm Apax [APAX.UL] are among the bidders for Norwegian IT outsourcing firm Evry <EVRY.OL>, four sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The company, which has a current market capitalization of 4.57 billion Norwegian crowns ($701.2 million), said in August that it was considering selling itself, sending shares up as much as 35 percent. [ID:nL5N0QX1PI] Second-round bids for the Oslo-listed firm are due in mid-November, with three bidders left in the process, two of the sources said.  Evry, Tieto and Apax were not immediately available to comment.
