WASHINGTON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The following are highlights of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on Friday in Washington, where finance ministers, central bankers and other top officials are gathering.

IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRISTINE LAGARDE FROM PLENARY SESSION ON GLOBAL UNEMPLOYMENT "If the unemployed formed their own country, it would be the fifth-largest in the world." ON CHALLENGES FOR GLOBAL ECONOMY "These are not new insights, but action in the past has often lacked. This time the challenge is for real. We must aim higher, try harder, and work better together to achieve higher growth outcomes." ON RISKS FOR GLOBAL ECONOMY "Putting it another way, there is too little economic risk taking, and too much financial risk taking. ... Risks are more concentrated - the top ten global asset management firms now control a whopping $19 trillion. This is larger than the world's largest economy - the United States." "2015 is shaping up to be a make-or-break year. If we miss this chance, then we are failing the world's poorest people, the generations to come, and the planet."  ANGEL GURRIA, OECD SECRETARY-GENERAL, IN IMFC STATEMENT "As regards monetary policy, the euro area needs more vigorous stimulus ... Although the output gap in Japan has closed, further quantitative easing is still needed to secure a lasting break with deflation and offset the drag on demand from fiscal consolidation."  OBAID HUMAID AL TAYER, FINANCIAL AFFAIRS MINISTER OF UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, IN IMFC STATEMENT "Without concerted policies in major economies, the pick-up in growth may again fall short of expectations in spite of the easing of both financial conditions and the pace of fiscal consolidation. In this regard, we appreciate the recent supportive measures by the ECB to tackle low inflation and address fragmentation, including through a reduction in policy rates and targeted easing."  FINNISH FINANCE MINISTER ANTTI RINNE "Where fiscal space exists, it may be used to further support growth through productive investments, for example in public infrastructure, while staying within credible medium-term frameworks. The unwinding of unconventional monetary policy in the U.S. should be conducted in such a way as to minimize the risk of erratic market reaction. Clear communication will be crucial."
