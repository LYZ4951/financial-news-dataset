WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The mix of low interest rates, high liquidity and low volatility in the global economy is "not without danger," European Central Bank Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said on Thursday.

Speaking on the sidelines of World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, Weidmann said he expected discussion on Friday, when Group of 20 officials meet, about fiscal stimulus and sustainable growth.
