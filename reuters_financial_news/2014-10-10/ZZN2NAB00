SHANGHAI, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares tumbled nearly 2 percent on Friday on weakness in global equity  markets plus jitters over a possible flare-up in pro-democracy protests in the city.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> dropped 1.9 percent to 23,088.54 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 1.7 percent. For the week, the HSI was up 0.1 percent while the HSCE index was down 0.5 percent. Analysts said some investors were nervous that pro-democracy protests could re-ignite after Hong Kong students said they would maintain their campaign for political change after the city government cancelled talks with them.
