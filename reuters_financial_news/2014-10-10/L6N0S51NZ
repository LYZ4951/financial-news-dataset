COPENHAGEN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Nordjyske Bank <NORDJB.CO> and Norresundby Bank <NRSU.CO>, both based in the north-western part of Denmark, plan to merge into Nordbank from January 1 2015, they said in a joint statement on Friday.

The banks said it was a merger of equals and that they had not yet decided on the terms by which the shares in the two banks would be turned into shares in the new bank.  Nordjyske Bank will be the continuing business but the new bank's headquarter will be in Norresundby, the banks said. Norresundby Bank has a market cap of 1.2 billion Danish crowns ($170 mln) and Nordjyske Bank has a market cap of 914 million crowns.  The banks had not planned to announce the merger plan yet but decided to do so as documents describing the plan were stolen from a car on Wednesday evening. The banks cover specific areas of the Northern Jutland region, overlapping in only two towns, and use the same data centre which would make the merger smoother and less expensive. The banks expect to be able to cut 50 jobs due to synergies.
