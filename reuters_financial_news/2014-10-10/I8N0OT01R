MUMBAI, Oct 10 (Reuters) - India's central bank will remove foreign investment limits on the country's debt markets once the economy reaches its potential output over two consecutive years and foreigners move to long-end maturities, Euromoney reported Governor Raghuram Rajan as saying.

These two factors would happen "once the world becomes excited in a more substantial way about the India story", Euromoney quoted the Reserve Bank of India Governor as saying during an interview with the magazine.
