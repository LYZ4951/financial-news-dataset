LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England shed light on Friday on some of its contingency plans if Scotland had voted in favour of independence last month, saying it was ready to supply extra bank notes and pump extra liquidity into banks.

A record of the BoE Financial Policy Committee's Sept. 26 meeting also showed policymakers were concerned that tail risks in financial markets were priced wrongly, and that this could affect how it sets banks' cyclical capital buffers later this year. Scots voted on Sept. 18 to retain their centuries-old union with the rest of the United Kingdom. But opinion polls running up to the referendum had been close, and on Friday the BoE revealed what might have happened if Scots had voted 'yes'. "In the event of a 'yes' vote, and as a precautionary measure to back-stop sterling money market liquidity, the Bank would immediately announce its intention to conduct additional (liquidity) operations in each of the two succeeding weeks," the BoE said. "The Bank had in place arrangements to meet potential increased demand for Bank of England notes from holders of Scottish notes," it added. The BoE said there could have been major effects on banks and insurers based in Scotland or with substantial Scottish assets and liabilities. Elsewhere in the FPC record, the BoE also said more about how it would set new leverage ratios and counter-cyclical capital buffers for banks. Banks are on tenterhooks over the leverage ratio they will have to meet, with widespread expectation it will be higher than the 3 percent interim level proposed under a global bank capital accord known as Basel III. The BoE said last week that it would give more details by the end of this month after earlier plans to wait until next year had worried banks and legislators.
