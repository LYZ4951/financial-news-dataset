PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - European shares dropped early on Friday, extending their recent pull-back and tracking steep losses in equity markets worldwide spurred by mounting worries over the pace of global growth.

At 0703 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.9 percent at 1,302.37 points, hitting a level not seen since early August.
