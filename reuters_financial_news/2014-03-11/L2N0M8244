RIO DE JANEIRO, March 11 (Reuters) - Latin American currencies extended their recent slide on Tuesday on lingering concern about falling Chinese demand for the region's commodities exports, but stock indexes steadied after a recent sell-off.

Chile's peso <CLP=> led losses among regional currencies, falling 0.8 percent to its weakest in nearly five years, after prices of copper <CMCU3>, the country's main export, tumbled to three-year lows. [ID:nL6N0M83ST] The Brazilian real <BRL=> <BRBY> closed 0.6 percent weaker in its fourth straight session of losses, even as the central bank provided investors with protection against a weaker exchange rate by selling currency swaps. "With iron ore prices falling, it will be much harder for the Brazilian real to 'graduate' from the Fragile Five basket by showing good trade numbers," Citi strategist Kenneth Lam wrote in a note to clients. He referred to the currencies of Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey and South Africa, which Morgan Stanley said are poised to underperform due to their countries' current account deficits. The Mexican peso <MXN=> lost 0.4 percent in its third straight session of declines. Latin American stocks halted a two-day sell-off, however, with the MSCI benchmark index for the region <.MILA00000PUS> little changed, near its lowest since Feb. 6. Brazil's Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> edged 0.4 percent higher, although shares of mining and steel companies continued their decline as prices of iron ore fell to 17-month lows. Preferred shares of Vale SA <VALE5.SA>, the world's largest iron ore producer, fell 1 percent to 26.10 reais, an eight-month low. Companhia Siderurgica Nacional <CSNA3.SA>, Brazil's No. 3 steelmaker and No. 2 iron ore producer, fell 2.3 percent to 8.65 reais. Supporting gains in the Bovespa index were shares of bank Itaú Unibanco <ITUB4.SA> and those of state-run oil firm Petrobras <PETR4.SA>.  Petrobras gained 0.8 percent and recovered part of the losses it recorded on the previous day, when it sold $8.5 billion in global notes.Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2055 GMT: Stock indexesdaily % YTD %  Latest  change  change  MSCI Emerging   955.89  0.09-4.67  Markets <.MSCIEF> MSCI LatAm  2881.78 0.07-9.97  <.MILA00000PUS>   Brazil Bovespa  45697.620.36-11.28  <.BVSP>   Mexico IPC  38689.570.05-9.45   <.MXX>   Chile IPSA  3659.3  0.19-1.08  <.IPSA>   Chile IGPA  18104.770.17-0.67  <.IGPA>   Argentina MerVal5754.38 -0.61   6.74  <.MERV>   Colombia IGBC   12922.660.96-1.14  <.IGBC>   Peru IGRA   15110.220.09-4.08  <.IGRA>   Venezuela IBC   2642.39 -1.53   -3.44   <.IBC> Currencies  daily % YTD %Latestchange  change  Brazil real 2.3666  -0.62   -0.41  <BRBY>Mexico peso 13.2775 -0.47   -1.86  <MXN=>Chile peso  574.2   -0.78   -8.38  <CLP=CL>  Colombia peso   2044.35 -0.14   -5.50  <COP=>Peru sol2.801   0.00-0.29  <PEN=PE>  Argentina peso  7.8650  -0.03   -17.45  (interbank)   <ARS=RASL>Argentina peso  10.81.39-7.41  (parallel) <ARSB=><-------------------------------------------------------------- GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2014: http://link.reuters.com/jus35t GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2014:
