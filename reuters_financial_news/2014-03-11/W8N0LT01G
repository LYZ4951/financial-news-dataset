WARSAW, March 11 (Reuters) - Poland's No.2 lender Bank Pekao <PEO.WA> on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected 1-percent net profit drop in the fourth quarter, as rises in its loan portfolio compensated almost fully the harm from record-low interest rates.

Pekao, the Polish arm of Italy's UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, said it earned 736 million zlotys ($242.3 million) compared to 662 million expected by analysts polled by Reuters. This resulted in a 5.4-percent dip in the lender's full-year net profit to 2.785 billion zlotys, versus 2.725 billion expected by analysts.
