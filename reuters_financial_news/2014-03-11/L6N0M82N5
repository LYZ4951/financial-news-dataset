LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. investment group Baron Capital has built up a stake worth about $150 million in English soccer champions Manchester United <MANU.N>, it said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

The investment by New York-based Baron represents about 5.8 percent of United's $2.6 billion market value but a dual-share structure means that the American Glazer family remains firmly in control of the club. It is however a vote of confidence for United in a season in which the team has struggled on the field and risks missing out on a lucrative place in the Champions League for next season. In its most recent investment guidance, Baron - describing itself as a long-term investor in growth businesses - said it remained positive on United's prospects, citing the possibility of a renwewed kit supply deal with U.S. sportswear group Nike <NKE.N>.  United shares closed at $15.84 in New York on Monday, up from a flotation price of $14 in August 2012.
