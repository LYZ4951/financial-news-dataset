March 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-term foreign  currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Azerbaijan-based Unibank (UB) and  Demirbank (DB) at 'B', and Atabank (AB), AGBank (AGB) and Bank Technique (BT) at  'B-'. The Outlooks on UB and DB have been revised to Positive from Stable. The  Outlook on AGB has been revised to Stable from Negative. The Outlooks on AB and  BT are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS: IDRs AND VIABILITY RATINGS (VRs)  The affirmations reflect the banks' largely stable credit metrics and currently  favourable broader economy, which is supported by high oil prices. The  spill-over effects of high oil prices on the non-oil economy coupled with  significant government spending supported the gradual resolution of post-crisis  asset quality problems. Additionally, the banks' bottom lines (particularly at  UB and DB) have benefited from rapid expansion in higher margin retail and  micro-lending.  Liquidity across the sector has been stable, underpinned by fairly sticky  funding and stable deposit growth. Wholesale funding of private banks is mainly  sourced either from the government or from development institutions, remains  limited in volume and reasonably diversified by maturity (for more details on  the operating environment see "Fitch: Azerbaijan's Banking Sector Broadly  Stable; Structural Vulnerabilities Remain" dated 6 March 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com). All five banks face capital pressure resulting from weak profit generation  (except for UB) driven by margin compression in corporate lending, small  operational scale, still significant impairment charges and limited new equity  injections. ROAE was a moderate 5% at AGB and 10% at AB in 2013. However, DB and  UB appear better positioned to improve capitalisation from internal sources, as  both banks' ROAE was commensurate with loan growth in 2013. UB and DB reported fast retail growth of around 80% and 36%, respectively, in  2013, although both have managed credit risks fairly well so far, as reflected  by low credit losses in 2013 (below 3.5% of average loans in 2013 at both  banks). Fitch believes that further growth of reasonable quality in retail and  micro-lending is possible in the sector due to currently low consumer  indebtedness and low credit penetration (retail loans/GDP equal to 11% at  end-2013). However, loss rates are likely to increase as loan books season and  market saturation increases. Credit risks relate mainly to slowly-amortising corporate loan books, which are  particularly highly concentrated at AGB, AB and BT, with the largest 20  borrowers accounting for around 30%-40% of total loans or around 1.7x-2.1x  end-2013 statutory equity in each case. AB's asset quality is currently  reasonable, with non-performing loans (NPLs; loans 90+ days overdue, reported  net of accrued interest) standing at 4.4% in end-2013 statutory accounts, but a  higher 10.5% and 24.2%, respectively at AGB and BT. BT's unreserved NPLs were  equal to a high 1.7x IFRS equity at end-1H13, but Fitch expects this to decrease  gradually based on reasonable collateral against some exposures and management's  reasonable track record of impaired loan recoveries. The Positive Outlooks on UB and DB reflects Fitch's base case scenario that  their performance will remain reasonable as loan books season, and that their  more robust business models, growth strategies and internal capital generation  will therefore warrant upgrades. The banks' profitability benefits from higher  margin retail/small business lending, the moderate (compared with peers)  volatility of their impairment charges through the cycle, and the lower amount  of legacy impaired and non-core assets (which are particularly high at BT and  AGB).  The revision of AGB's Outlook to Stable from Negative reflects the stabilisation  of asset quality and significant improvement of operating performance. In 2013,  AGB reported positive, albeit moderate, pre-impairment profit in its statutory  accounts of AZN3.6m (8% of starting equity) net of non-received interest. Loan  impairment charges were a moderate 1.3% of average loans. At the same time,  Fitch continues to consider the amount of accrued, but not received, interest  income as substantial relative to capital (0.6x tangible statutory equity at  end-2013). Part of this relates to performing loans with grace periods on  interest payments.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs and VRs UB and DB could be upgraded if they show an extended track record of reasonable  asset quality and manage to defend their profitability amid more intense  competition and greater market saturation in their lending segments. Conversely,  a marked weakening of profitability and/or deterioration of asset quality would  likely result in the revision of the Outlooks to Stable. Upside potential for the ratings of BT, AGB and AB is unlikely in the near term,  as reflected by their Stable Outlooks. However, gradual improvements in the  operating environment, further recoveries of legacy impaired loans and the  strengthening of the banks' internal capital generation could give rise to  moderate upward rating pressure over time. The ratings of all five banks could come under downward pressure if there was a  large and sustained drop in oil prices, although this scenario is not expected  in the near term. Sharp deterioration in asset quality and/or liquidity at any  of the banks could also cause a downgrade.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATINGS (SRs) and SUPPORT  RATING FLOORS (SRFs) The SRFs of 'No Floor' and '5' Support Ratings for each of the banks reflect  their relatively limited systemic importance, as a result of which extraordinary  support from the Azerbaijan authorities cannot be relied upon, in Fitch's view.  The potential for support from private shareholders cannot be reliably assessed.  Fitch does not expect any revision of the banks' SRFs or Support Ratings in the  foreseeable future.
