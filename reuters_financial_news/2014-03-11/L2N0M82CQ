SAO PAULO, March 11 (Reuters) - Fabio Okumura, a senior trader at Itaú Unibanco Holding SA's <ITUB4.SA> proprietary trading desk, resigned on Tuesday, taking with him an unspecified number of members of his team, two sources with knowledge of the situation said.

Okumura, who was a director at Itaú BBA SA, the wholesale and investment-banking unit of Itaú, Brazil's largest lender by market value, is leaving to start up an investment firm, said one source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. According to the same source, Okumura took with him as many as 10 traders from Itaú's propietary trading desk, a division that usually trades stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other financial instruments with the firm's own money.  Efforts to reach Okamura directly were unsuccessful.  Okumura, a partner at Itaú BBA, reported to Daniel Gleizer, a former central bank policymaker who is a senior executive vice president at the lender, a second source said.
