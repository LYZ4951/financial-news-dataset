PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - Altice <ATCE.AS> said its 10.9 billion euro ($15.1 billion) cash and share offer to combine Vivendi's <VIV.PA> SFR unit with Numericable <NUME.PA> still stood and remained valid until Friday.

The deal would see Vivendi retain a 32 percent stake in the new combined mobile operator. Bouygues Telecom <BOUY.PA> has made a rival bid for 10.5 billion euros in which Vivendi would keep 46 percent. Bouygues Telecom said on Sunday that it had agreed to sell its mobile network and much of its spectrum to smaller rival Iliad <ILD.PA> as a way to head off competition regulators' concerns over its SFR bid.
