March 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

For the fourth consecutive year, the US high yield default rate remained low, ending 2013 at 1.5%, according to Fitch Ratings. Thirty-six issuers defaulted on $18.5 billion in bonds, a near repeat of 2012's 32 issuer defaults and $20.5 billion tally. The average recovery rate in 2013 was 47.7% of par, down from 50.2% in 2012. The  presence and poor performance of emerging market (EM) dollar-denominated  defaults put some pressure on the year's recovery results. EM issues - nearly  all senior unsecured - experienced an average recovery rate of 21.1% of par,  below the 66.1% recorded across domestic defaults. Energy, broadcasting and media, and building and materials led default activity  in 2013. Both energy and building and materials were disproportionately affected  by EM dollar-denominated defaults, with the latter making up 72% and 100% of  volume in each area, respectively. One of these defaults was in fact the largest  of the year, the collapse of Brazilian oil company OGX Petroleo e Gas  Participacoes SA ($3.6 billion). Other large defaults in 2013 included publisher Cengage Learning ($1.9 billion),  services and e-commerce provider Travelport LLC [BLKSTT.UL] ($1.0 billion), and a distressed  debt exchange (DDE) of $1.3 billion from Energy Future Holdings [TXEFHE.UL] (EFH). An EFH bankruptcy would add 1.5% to Fitch's base default forecast for 2014 of  1.5%-2.0% and would also represent the latest example of unsuccessful DDEs.  Fitch has calculated that of the DDEs completed 2008-2013 (79 issuers, $62  billion in bonds), 32% have had a subsequent event of default. For these  companies, the average time from the original DDE to a second default was 1.1  years. In the low default years of 2010-2013, eight companies have experienced a  post-DDE default. Fitch recorded two defaults in the first two months of 2014, resulting in a  trailing 12-month default rate of 1.3% through February. Four defaults in March  ($1.4 billion) bring the year-to-date tally to $1.8 billion. This compares with  a full first-quarter 2013 total of $3.4 billion.
