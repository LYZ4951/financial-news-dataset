March 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Netherlands-based Hyva Global's [HYVAG.UL] (Hyva) Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at 'B'. The Outlook on the IDR is Negative. Fitch has also affirmed Hyva's US dollar senior secured notes due 2016  at 'B'. Fitch has simultaneously withdrawn all the ratings. Hyva's ratings are supported by its improving operations and adequate liquidity,  but credit metrics remain weak for its rating level, which supports our Negative  Outlook. Hyva is a manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders for applications in  heavy-duty equipment. Fitch is withdrawing the ratings on Hyva's request. Hyva has chosen to stop  participating in the rating process and Fitch will no longer have sufficient  information to maintain the ratings. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide  ratings or analytical coverage for Hyva.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Modest Recovery to Continue: Hyva's operations are recovering modestly after a  sharp deterioration in 2012, helped by a low base effect and improved demand,  especially from China and Brazil. 9M13 revenue is still down 4.7% yoy but  quarterly revenue began to show positive yoy growth starting in 3Q13 as sales in  China bottomed during 1Q13. Overall EBITDA for 9M13 remained flat from the  previous year, but if we exclude one-off restructuring costs of USD6.9m,  adjusted EBITDA improved by nearly 20%. We expect the modest recovery to  continue, leading to improvement in revenue and profitability.  Credit Metrics to Improve: With the improvement in operating performance, we  expect the company to generate positive free cash flow from 2014 with improved  operating cash flow and stable working capital. Accordingly we also expect the  company's credit metrics, which had deteriorated sharply in 2012, to gradually  improve over the next two to three years. 4Q13 results have yet to be announced,  but we expect the company's FFO net leverage to have fallen to around 7x in 2013  from 9x in 2012 and to improve further in 2014.  Leverage and Interest Coverage Remain Stretched: While the improvement in credit  metrics is positive, we believe Hyva's leverage remains high for its rating  level and will remain above our negative guideline of 5.5x in 2014. FFO fixed  charge coverage is also expected to improve but to remain below our 1.5x  guideline until 2014. As such, a Negative Outlook remains appropriate at this  point of time. Robust Market Presence: Hyva's ratings are supported by its strong market  presence in its niche markets and well-diversified geographical sales base, with  a strong focus on high-growth emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil.
