WARSAW, March 11 (Reuters) - Warsaw-listed real-estate developer GTC <GTCP.WA> has issued 200 million zlotys ($66 million) worth of bonds to refinance part of its current debt and fund future growth, the group said on Tuesday.

GTC issued 20,000 bonds paying a 4.5 percent coupon and maturing in 2019. The issue comes after earlier in the year GTC completed a 224-million zloty share offer aimed at cutting its debt. [ID:nL6N0KL04V]
