MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - Shares in UniCredit <CRDI.MI> rose sharply on Tuesday after the Italian bank reported a large 2013 net loss due to writedowns of goodwill and bad loans but ruled out any need of a capital increase.

"There is a number of factors pushing the stock up: they dispelled any doubts about the need for a capital increase and did a really good clean-up of their balance-sheet," a Milan-based trader said. By 1415 GMT shares in UniCredit rose 6.4 percent. The stock had briefly turned negative after the results, which showed a net loss of 14 billion euros for 2013. UniCredit said that in the full year loan loss provisions had totalled 13.7 billion euros - of which 9.3 billion euros in the fourth quarter alone. This is much higher than an analyst estimates of around 4 billion euros. Goodwill impairments stood at 9 billion euros, with the bank saying it had fully written down the goodwill allocated to Italy, Austria and central and eastern Europe. [nI6N0M400P]
