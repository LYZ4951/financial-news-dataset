March 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Today's vote by the European Parliament is a  significant step towards implementing Solvency II and ensures the long-delayed  regulatory regime for insurers is on track to take effect at the start of 2016,  Fitch Ratings says. There are still several elements to be finalised, which  could have a significant impact on capital levels, but we expect these to be  agreed in time for implementation. We understand that earlier industry concerns about the Solvency II treatment of  long-term guarantee business, including annuities, have largely receded based on  the latest draft of the rules. Legal & General is one of the insurers that stood  to be most affected, given its sizable proportion of annuity business. Last  week, L&G's Group CFO said the company expected its Solvency II capital surplus  to be larger than under Solvency I. Although we believe Solvency II is on track for finalisation, we estimate that  the elements still to be decided could affect the capital positions of some  major insurers by several hundred million pounds. Notable examples include  details around determining the discount rate to calculate insurers' reserves and  capital requirements, and the choice of economic and demographic assumptions by  insurers using an internal model for Solvency II - which will be subject to  regulatory approval. However, we believe the insurers we rate have sufficient  capital buffers to absorb the potential effects of this remaining uncertainty. Given the level of preparation to date and the likely transitional arrangements,  we do not expect Solvency II to trigger changes to insurers' credit ratings in  the next few years.
