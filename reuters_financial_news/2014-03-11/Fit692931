March 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to QVC  Inc.'s [LQCVI.UL] (QVC) proposed 5- and 10-year note offering. Proceeds are expected to be  used to reduce borrowings drawn on QVC's revolver ($922 million outstanding at  Dec. 31, 2013).  Any excess proceeds are expected to be used for general  corporate purposes, including working capital. Fitch views the transaction as  neutral to the credit profile as it is expected to be materially leverage  neutral. For additional information regarding Liberty and QVC, please see  Fitch's credit report published on Sept. 26, 2013. A full ratings list is  provided at the end of this release. The QVC notes' security package (including the proposed note offering) mirrors  the credit facility's security package. Both sets of instruments are pari passu  with each other and benefit from a security interest in the capital stock of QVC  and are guaranteed by QVC's material domestic subsidiaries.  Under the credit agreement, priority debt (debt senior to the credit agreements  and the notes) is limited to 50% of QVC EBITDA (an approximately $900 million  limit). All other additional debt (either pari passu or subordinated to QVC's  existing debt) is primarily limited by the 3.5x financial leverage covenant.  Under the secured indentures (including the proposed note offering), additional  indebtedness is limited by a 2x interest coverage incurrence test, with standard  carve outs. In addition, debt secured by QVC/QVC subsidiary assets is limited to  $4.5 billion/$5 billion (currently there is no debt issued under this basket).  Fitch notes that under the indenture documents, if QVC were to pledge the equity  of its subsidiaries to secure debt in the future, the notes (and the credit  facility under the bank agreement) would receive the security as well. Fitch  does not expect this to happen.  In addition to the debt limitations discussed above, the provisions of these  notes include a 101% change of control offer that is triggered if 1) more than  30% of the voting power is acquired by a person other than a Permitted Holder  (as defined), 2) such voting power exceeds the voting power of the Permitted  Holders, and 3) QVC's secured notes are rated non-investment grade. As with the  QVC secured indentures, in the event that the notes are rated investment grade  (as defined), the limitations on debt, restricted payments and other provisions  would fall away and would not be reinstated, regardless of any rating changes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect the October 2013 announcement that Liberty intends to 1)  spin-off its 22% equity/57% voting interest in TripAdvisor Inc. <TRIP.O> (TRIP) and its  BuySeasons Inc. business (Evite will be separated from BuySeasons) and 2)  separate the Liberty Interactive tracking stock into two new tracking stocks:  Liberty Digital Commerce (LDCA/B), which will have the e-commerce companies  attributed to it, and QVC (QVCA/B), which will hold QVC and the 38% HSN, Inc.  stake. While Liberty consolidated TRIP into its financial statements, Fitch  excluded TRIP from its financial analysis. While the loss of TRIP's value  (approximately $2.6 billion) is unfavorable to the credit profile, Fitch's  ratings materially rely on QVC, with Liberty's other investments, such as TRIP,  viewed as incremental support to the ratings. The spin-off of BuySeasons will  not cause a material change to the credit profile. The operations of BuySeasons  was not a material contributor to the Liberty consolidated profile. As Fitch's ratings for Liberty and QVC reflect the consolidated legal  entity/obligor credit profile, rather than the tracking stock structure, the  separation of the Liberty Interactive tracking stock does not have a material  impact on the credit profile. Based on Fitch's interpretation of the Liberty  bond indentures, the company could not spin out QVC without consent of the  bondholders, based on the current asset mix at Liberty. QVC generates 84% and  95% of Liberty's revenues and EBITDA, respectively. In addition, Fitch believes  QVC makes up a meaningful portion of Liberty's equity value. Any spin-off of QVC  would likely trigger the 'substantially all' asset disposition restriction  within the Liberty indentures.  The consolidated legal/obligor credit view (discussed above) may change over  time if the Liberty Ventures (LVNT) or LDC assets become a more meaningful  portion of the consolidated Liberty asset mix/equity value. At that point, Fitch  may adopt a more hybrid rating analysis, taking into consideration the  attribution of assets and liabilities within each tracking stock. Fitch does not  expect this to occur in the near or intermediate term.  The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation that the company will continue to manage  leverage on a Liberty consolidated basis. Fitch expects Liberty's gross  unadjusted leverage to be managed at 4x and QVC unadjusted gross leverage to be  managed at 2.5x.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, Fitch calculates QVC's unadjusted gross leverage at 2x and  Liberty's unadjusted gross leverage at 3.8x (excludes Trip Advisor's debt and  EBITDA). While Fitch expects EBITDA growth would lead to reduced leverage, Fitch  expects Liberty to manage leverage closer to its target levels over the long  term. Currently, there is financial flexibility for debt-funded acquisition  and/or share repurchases. Fitch rates both QVC's senior secured bank credit facility and the senior  secured notes 'BBB-' (two notches higher than QVC's IDR). The secured issue  rating reflects what Fitch believes would be QVC's standalone rating.  The ratings incorporate the risk of continued acquisitions at Liberty  Interactive. Fitch recognizes that there is a risk of an acquisition of HSN,  Inc. However, the ratings may remain unchanged depending on how the transaction  is structured and on the company's commitment to returning QVC's or Liberty's  leverage to 2.5x and 4x, respectively.  Fitch recognizes QVC's ability to manage product mix and adapt to its customers  shopping preferences. QVC has managed to grow revenues over the last three years  (up 1.3% in 2013) and manage Fitch calculated EBITDA margins in the 20% to 22%  range over that same time frame. Fitch believes that QVC will be able to  continue to grow revenues at least at GDP levels going forward. Fitch models  low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth at both QVC and at Liberty consolidated.  QVC EBITDA margin fluctuation is driven in part by the product mix and will  likely fluctuate over time as the product mixes change. However, Fitch believes,  over the next few years, QVC's EBITDA margins will remain in this historical 20%  to 22% range.   Liquidity and Maturities Fitch believes liquidity at Liberty Interactive will be sufficient to support  operations and QVC's expansion into other markets. Acquisitions and share  buybacks are expected to be a primary use of free cash flow (FCF). Fitch believes that there is sufficient liquidity and cash generation (from  investment dividends and tax sharing between the tracking stocks) to support  debt service and disciplined investment at LVNT. Fitch recognizes that in the  event of a liquidity strain at LVNT, QVC could provide funding to support debt  service (via intercompany loans), or the tracking stock structure could be  collapsed. Fitch notes that cash can travel throughout all entities relatively easily  (although the tracking stock structure adds a layer of complexity, Liberty LLC  has in the past reattributed assets and liabilities). Fitch believes that  resources at QVC would be used to support Liberty LLC, and vice versa, if ever  needed. Fitch believes Liberty continues to carry meaningful liquidity. Liberty carried  $905 million in cash (ex-TRIP), $1.1 billion of availability on QVC's $2 billion  revolver (expires March 2018), and $4.2 billion in other public holdings  (ex-TRIP) as of Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch calculates FCF of $714 million (ex-TRIP) in  FYE 2013. Based on Fitch's conservative projections, Fitch expects Liberty's FCF  to be in the range of $750 million to $900 million. Liberty's near-term maturities include $400 million of 1% HSN exchangeable  debentures that may be put to or redeemed by the company in 2016.  QVC's next  maturity, other than its credit facility in 2018, is approximately $769 million  in 7.5% senior secured notes due in 2019, which becomes callable by QVC at  103.75 on Oct. 1, 2014. Fitch believes Liberty has sufficient liquidity to  handle these maturities and potential redemption.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Actions: Fitch believes that the current financial policy is  consistent with the current ratings. If the company were to manage to more  conservative leverage targets, ratings may be upgraded.  Negative Rating Actions: Conversely, changes to financial policy (including more  aggressive leverage targets) and asset mix changes that weakened bondholder  protection could pressure the ratings. While unexpected, revenue declines in  excess of 10% that materially drove declines in EBITDA and FCF and resulted in  QVC leverage exceeding 2.5x would likely pressure ratings.   Fitch currently rates Liberty and QVC as follows: Liberty --IDR 'BB'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BB'.   QVC --IDR 'BB'; --Senior secured debt 'BBB-'.
