SEOUL, March 11 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged on Thursday as board members monitor tensions in Ukraine and Governor Kim Choong-soo presides over the last policy meeting of his term, a Reuters poll found.

All 24 analysts polled forecast the Bank of Korea will keep its base rate <KROCRT=ECI> unchanged at 2.50 percent for a 10th consecutive month at its monetary policy meeting on March 13. The majority of those who forecast a hold on rates said although inflationary pressures were weak, economic recovery was continuing strongly and risks from volatility in some emerging markets last month had receded to a degree.  Out of the 21 analysts who gave a clear view on the central bank's next policy move, 19 said the Bank of Korea would hike rates, with the timing ranging from as early as the third quarter of this year to the second quarter of 2015. The remaining two said the Bank of Korea would cut rates in the second quarter of this year. Governor Kim Choong-soo will leave his position at the end of March, when he will be succeeded by former deputy governor Lee Ju-yeol, who market participants believe will be unlikely to cut interest rates soon.
