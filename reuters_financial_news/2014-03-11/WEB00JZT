COPENHAGEN, March 11 (Reuters) - Danish outsourcing company ISS <ISSAS.CO> [ISSHOI.UL] will complete its initial public offering a day earlier than planned thanks to strong investor demand, and list its shares on Thursday of this week, rather than Friday, the company said on Tuesday.

The offering to retail investors will close on Tuesday at 1200 CET, while the sale of shares to institutional investors will close on Wednesday at 1600 CET. The company said it has had very strong demand from investors, and that information about the result of the offering, including the final offer price and the allocation of shares, is expected to be announced on Thursday. The original deadline for closing the share sale was March 14.
