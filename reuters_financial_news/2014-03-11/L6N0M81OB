FRANKFURT, March 11 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank made its forward guidance more precise at its March meeting by emphasising the slack in the euro zone economy, ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said on Tuesday.

Constancio also said the ECB still had policy amunition in the form of lower interest rates or quantitative easing if needed. "All the messages were not taken in completely," Constancio told MNI news agency in an interview. "The forward guidance was made more precise in relation to the existence of this slack. Unfortunately ... this was not picked up by the markets." "We have tools on the table that we consider as available to use if the need arises. And that includes, as it has been said, either cuts in rates or QE or asset purchases," he added.
