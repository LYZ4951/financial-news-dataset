NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - The market remains in a bit of a vacuum, with interesting activity focused on a few speculative investments that don't necessarily suggest anything about the larger environment - though one could extrapolate from the interest in these myriad issues that the market is getting frothy, one way or another.

The island of Puerto Rico will sell about $3 billion in bonds to a varying group of investors on Tuesday, many of whom are likely not to be traditional municipal bond buyers.  What's interesting to see, as our muni team pointed out late Monday, is that the bonds appear set to sell at an 8-percent coupon, with yields somewhere in the mid-8s or high-8s. That's nowhere near the 10-percent yield that some had expected.  [ID:nL2N0M71HC] What may be happening is a bit of fortuitous timing as the market had been in the midst of a half-way decent rally for a bit here and as investors clear the decks of some emerging-markets assets that have underperformed.  The rest of the world has caught a bit of a cold here, it seems, so safer assets - and Puerto Rico qualifies on some bizarre level - will reap the rewards. Some of it is also the buyers: Distressed debt funds and high-yield funds, along with hedge funds looking for fat yields and a bit less concerned about the implied risk that the junk-level sale suggests. The constant refrain one hears is that people would invest in somewhere other than the stock market but have nowhere to go. Well, there's some nice beachfront property here.  ACKMAN  Tuesday also promises the latest chapter in the saga of Bill Ackman vs. Herbalife <HLF.N>. This has so far not worked out all that well for Ackman, given the share increase in the last 12 months (admittedly, the stock has been weaker so far this year, losing about 18 percent).  The hedge fund manager is expected to make a presentation that will include new allegations relating specifically to its operations in China, suggesting the company is violating laws in that country. The Ackman thesis, essentially, is that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme, where only the first few investors are guaranteed to make money, though he has motivated opponents on the other side, including Carl Icahn, and of course, the company itself.  As of Friday, about 18 percent of the company's shares were being borrowed for short bets - a high figure - though it had been more than 20 percent a few months ago, according to Markit data.
