LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and other top policymakers from the central bank faced questions from the UK Treasury Committee about possible manipulation of key rates by foreign exchange traders and what the bank knew.

Below are highlights of their comments.   GOVERNOR MARK CARNEY:  BEST TO HAVE EXTERNAL PERSON TO REVIEW FX FIXING ALLEGATION  "Best practice would appear, to discharge this type of rule, would be to have external expertise, not just legal expertise but an external person to run these types of reviews, and also to run the reviews of the bank's policy functions."
