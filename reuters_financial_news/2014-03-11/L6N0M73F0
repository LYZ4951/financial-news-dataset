LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Almost half of Britain's bankers and other financial services professionals to receive 2013 bonuses were awarded more than the previous year, with the average payout rising by nearly a third, a survey showed on Tuesday.

The increase comes against the backdrop of public and investor anger over excessive compensation and European Union efforts to cap payments. [ID:nL6N0M41HO] Bonuses were unchanged from 2012 for 21 percent of 700 professionals surveyed by financial recruitment website eFinancialCareers, with only 18 percent of those surveyed receiving less than a year earlier. The majority of workers picked personal performance as the primary factor in determining their bonus, while 19 percent said their award related to their employer's results. A series of banks have recently disclosed that payments are on the rise, upsetting shareholders who believe that bonuses should reflect company performance. [ID:nL6N0M34GK] The European Union has sought to address that issue with a law that limits bonuses to no more than a banker's fixed salary, or twice that level with shareholder approval. It will apply to awards from this year.
