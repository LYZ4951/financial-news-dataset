BOGOTA, March 11 (Reuters) - Colombia's Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas sees no immediate reason to alter the benchmark interest rate while the economy grows below its rising potential and says the currency has reached a "floor" from which it is unlikely to strengthen.

In an interview with Reuters late on Monday, Cardenas stressed that monetary policy at the bank's meeting on March 21 will depend on GDP data that comes a day prior, but with low inflation, and output below the potential of 4.6 percent, borrowing costs could remain steady.
