March 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

While the financial impact of the conversion to  ICD-10 is expected to be manageable for non-profit hospitals, the potential for  revenue cycle disruption may have negative credit reverberations, according to a  new Fitch Ratings report. 'It is a challenging time as health care reform moves forward and other  pressures, such as sequestration, inpatient volume declines, and reduced  reimbursement, are being felt.  ICD-10 conversion will bring additional costs at  a time when hospital operations are already under pressure,' said Gary Sokolow,  Director in the U.S. Public Finance Group.ICD-10directly affects the central components of hospital reimbursement -  coding, billing, and payment.  Further complicating the change is the  simultaneous transition of government and private payors to ICD-10.   While providers and payors have had ample time to prepare for transition to  ICD-10 there is a heightened potential for payment delays and disruption.  Fitch  believes the solid liquidity position of investment-grade rated hospitals and  health systems should help weather short-term pressure.
