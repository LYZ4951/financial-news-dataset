TOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday that he sees no need to adjust monetary policy as the economy will continue to exceed its potential growth rate.

Kuroda, speaking to reporters, also said some temporary factors are behind recent weakness in exports, but exports will resume growing once these temporary factors fade away. Kuroda reiterated that the economy is on track to meet the central bank's 2 percent inflation target.
