BEIJING, March 11 (Reuters) - China is likely to liberalise deposit rates in one to two years, central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Tuesday at a media conference at China's annual palriament session.

"Deposit rate liberalisation is on our agenda. Personally I think it's very likely to be realised within one or two years," Zhou said.
