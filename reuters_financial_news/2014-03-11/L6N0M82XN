COPENHAGEN, March 11 (Reuters) - Denmark's parliament on Tuesday backed a controversial bill to allow the automatic extension of short term mortgage bonds under certain extreme circumstances where international debt markets freeze up, voting records showed.

The bill, proposed by the centre-left government, can impose extensions for a year at a time if a refinancing auction fails or if the interest rate on the bond increases by more than five percentage points. In January of this year, Danish banks held 808 billion Danish crowns ($150.28 billion) worth of mortgage bonds with a maturity of up to five years, while foreign investors had holdings of 381 billion. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said last year that Danish banks should cut the refinancing risk. The government and the central bank agreed that the risk should be reduced, as covered bonds play a key part in the Danish economy. The bonds finance most residential real estate and the market for the assets is the world's third-biggest after those of the United States and Germany.
