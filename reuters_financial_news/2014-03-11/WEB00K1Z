FRANKFURT, March 11 (Reuters) - German retailer Douglas has sold Hussel, its chain of confectionary stores to Emeran Capital Partners, as part of plans to focus on its perfume and beauty stores under its new owners.

Hussel, founded in 1949, is Germany's largest chain of confectionary stores with 219 stores in Germany and Austria. Emeran Capital Partners, based in Munich, said it would expand Hussel by opening more stores and strengthening its online and delivery offerings.
