TOKYO, April 30 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings <8604.T>, Japan's biggest investment banking and brokerage group, reported a 26 percent fall in quarterly profit as waning enthusiasm over economic stimulus policies brought down stock trading volumes.

Nomura, in a statement on Wednesday, said net profit totalled 61.3 billion yen ($597.76 million) in January-March from 82.4 billion yen in the same quarter a year earlier. The result compared with the 41 billion yen mean estimate of 5 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
