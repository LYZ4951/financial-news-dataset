SINGAPORE, April 30 (Reuters) - Singapore bank shares surged on Wednesday after two top lenders reported record profit for the first quarter, propping up the main index from 2-week lows.

DBS Group Holdings Ltd <DBSM.SI> shares jumped as much as 2.8 percent to S$17.31, their highest in more than 3 months, while OCBC Ltd <OCBC.SI> shares gained 3.2 percent to a 3-week high of S$9.77. The gains pushed the Singapore index <.FTSTI> up 0.77 percent from the 2-week low it hit on Tuesday. The two banks posted record quarterly profit that beat market estimates, powered by a double-digit growth in loans and improving interest rate margins. [ID:nL3N0NM1CW] UOB Ltd <UOBH.SI> shares rallied from 5-week lows, leaping 3.4 percent to S$21.89, though its first-quarter results are not due until after the market closes. CIMB maintained its "add" rating on DBS and left its target price of S$20.28 unchanged, saying in a research note it believed banks would be an outperforming asset class in Singapore this year. The brokerage also kept its "hold" rating on OCBC with a target price of S$10.08.
