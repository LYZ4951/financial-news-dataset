MUMBAI, April 30 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell on Wednesday to a 2-1/2 week low, retreating for a fourth session from a record high on Friday, as blue-chips geared to the domestic economy such as Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) and ICICI Bank slumped in a bout of profit-taking.

A third consecutive session of sales by foreign investors in index futures on Tuesday also dampened the mood.  L&T <LART.NS> provisionally fell 1.8 percent while ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> was down 1 percent.
