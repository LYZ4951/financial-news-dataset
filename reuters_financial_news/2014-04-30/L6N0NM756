April 30 (Reuters) - British media baron Richard Desmond will announce that he is selling free-to-air TV broadcaster Channel 5 to U.S.-based Viacom Inc <VIAB.O> for up to 450 million pounds ($760 million), The Guardian reported On Wednesday, without citing sources.

Viacom, which owns cable networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, is also expected to announce the deal on Thursday when it reports its financial results, the paper said on its website.

Northern & Shell could not be contacted outside of regular business hours, while Viacom declined to comment.  Media reports said in January Desmond was expecting to raise about 700 million pounds through the sale of the television network and had hired Barclays to look for buyers. [ID:nL6N0KB16I]
