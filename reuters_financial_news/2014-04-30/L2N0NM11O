April 30 (Reuters) - Those who missed out on buying Twitter <TWTR.N> when it first sold shares in November can get in at the lows now.

Shares of the social media company are down 11.8 percent on heavy volume to $37.58, after hitting a new low of $37.25 after the company's disappointing results on Tuesday afternoon. With more than 12 million shares traded through the first 25 minutes of action, the stock is second-most active among New York Stock Exchange-listed shares, trailing only utility acquiree Pepco Holdings.  Twitter was a brief member of the momentum crowd that investors surfed to major gains in late 2013, but it started to break down in January after peaking at $74.73 on December 26. Options activity in early trading Wednesday was dominated by bearish put action, where investors take out contracts that give them the right to sell the stock at a later date at a given price. The most active options on Wednesday were at the $34 and $35 put strikes, with 6,049 and 4,256 contracts traded, respectively, by 9:55 a.m. EDT.From earlier in the day:09:14 - The already solid outperformance by the utilities this year should continue on Wednesday on news of Exelon Corp's <EXC.N> acquisition of Pepco Holdings <POM.N> for $6.83 billion. Shares of Pepco are streaking in premarket action, gaining 18 percent to trade at $26.88 - which would be the highest price for that stock since 2008. The overall effect on the S&P 500 Utilities sector will be blunted by Exelon, however, as the acquirer is down 2.3 percent in the pre-open session.  Pepco only accounts for about 1.07 percent of the utilities index, whereas the much larger Exelon is 5.8 percent of the index, making it the fifth largest due to its market value of $31 billion.  Still, an 18 percent move in Pepco shares would boost its price by about $4.   08:38 - Stock futures have dipped a bit following a big miss from first quarter gross domestic product, although consumer spending was robust at a 3 percent gain.  Economic growth was a paltry 0.1 percent in the quarter - far worse than the anticipated 1.2 percent gain, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nLLAUFEARH] Other than consumer spending, key components of GDP were weaker than expected: business spending was down 2.1 percent, housing investment fell 5.7 percent, exports fell sharply, and government spending was lower. Futures have only been hit modestly by the news, though - the S&P 500 E-Mini contract was up a point or so before the report, and is now off by 2.5 points. Nasdaq E-mini futures have weakened a bit more substantially, but traders in that index have been more inclined to flee at the first sign of bad news.   08:24 - U.S. index futures are retracing losses on Wednesday after a strong-than-expected reading of U.S. private employment gains in the ADP report for April. Ahead of the report futures had been modestly lower after a disappointing quarterly report card from Twitter <TWTR.K>. * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 0.25 points, about 0.0 percent, with just under 125,000 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are down 6.25 points, or 0.16 percent, on volume of 22,260 contracts. * The Dow industrials <DJc1> are up 13 points, or around 0.08 percent, with 14 contracts traded. * On Tueday, the S&P 500 <.SPX> rose for the second day in a row.
