LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - British financial services company Saga [IPO-SAGA.L] said on Wednesday that it was planning to float on the London Stock Exchange, aiming to raise net proceeds of 550 million pounds ($927 million) to pay down debt.

Saga, which provides insurance to the over-50s, said that the new capital would cut its debt to around 700 million pounds, with a free float of at least 25 percent including a retail offering to UK investors.
