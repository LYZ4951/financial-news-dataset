April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The EU bank stress test assumptions appear sufficiently  robust to bolster investor confidence when complete, especially as it is  preceded by asset quality reviews (AQRs), Fitch Ratings says. The quantitative  stress evaluation is a good first step in ensuring Europe's major banks are  adequately capitalised. Reviews on capital planning, governance and contingency  planning could further enhance confidence.The credibility of the EU-wide stress test is enhanced this time by AQRs,  including one by the ECB for large eurozone banks subject to the single  supervisory mechanism. The AQR is a step towards the harmonisation of asset  quality measurement for the region, levelling the playing field for identifying  problem loans and assessing reserve coverage.  Many banks reviewed their portfolios in 2013, applying more conservative  classifications of impaired loans than previously and boosting provisions, often  encouraged and aided by national regulators. The most important outcome will be  a strengthening of the consistency of input data for the European Banking  Authority's (EBA) stress test.  EBA Scenarios The stress test itself includes baseline and adverse scenarios. The EBA's  scenarios involve economic variables that capture hypothetical changes in bond  yields, asset prices and economic growth globally, among other factors. The test  is more complex, comprehensive and tougher than the 2011 recapitalisation  exercise, which did not involve any adverse macro-economic scenario. We see the bond yield shock component in the adverse scenario as particularly  important for this review given the risk that a tapering of US Federal Reserve  bond purchases over the next year could leave some markets, particularly  emerging market economies, vulnerable. Another important shock is a currency  depreciation in central and eastern Europe to reflect global financial tensions.  The inclusion of sovereign debt haircuts in the scenarios makes the test more  rigorous, especially as a common approach will be applied to available-for-sale  (AFS) sovereign securities. Regulators can currently filter out unrealised  losses for AFS sovereign debt from banks' capital calculations. The stress test  will apply a consistent phase out of the filter. The adverse scenario assumes recession followed by marginal growth in 2016. This  is 7pp below the growth projected in the baseline scenario on a cumulative  basis. The baseline assumes that GDP grows   slightly higher than our 2014 and  2015 forecast of 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively.  ECB Timeframe to Cover Capital Shortfalls For participating eurozone banks, the ECB expects lenders to cover capital  shortfalls revealed by the AQR and the baseline stress test scenario through  common equity within six months after the result is announced in October.  Shortfalls under the adverse scenario must be met within nine months and can  include certain additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments, subject to caps that depend  on the trigger points. Many banks have raised equity or issued AT1 securities  this year. Fitch expects more to follow and believes AT1 trigger points may  increasingly be set with the ECB's shortfall qualification criteria in mind.We consider the nine month time horizon to meet stressed capital shortfalls to  be fairly aggressive but probably necessary to ensure confidence in the process  and establish European banks on a solid footing going into Banking Union.
