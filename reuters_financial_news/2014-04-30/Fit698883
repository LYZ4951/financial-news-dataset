April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings pointed out that the imposition of the upper limit of the price and volume of day old chicks (day old chick-DOC) expected to be temporary, and does not directly affect the ratings of PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia Tbk <JPFA.JK> (Japfa, BB-/ A + (idn) '/ Stable). In mid-April 2014, the Ministry of Commerce imposed a maximum limit  price of Rp 3,200 per DOC in the tail and a decrease in the volume of DOC by 15% in the business balancing the supply and helping small-scale chicken farmers who buy  DOC. According to the government, the price of a chicken and egg sales by farmers over  lower than the cost of production. The average price for sales Japfa DOC in  in 2013 was Rp 4,700 per head and the maximum price limit will cause  Japfa DOC losses in the division. However, Fitch does not expect the price restriction will  strictly enforced and sustainable, based on the expectation that  poultry consumption levels will continue to rise in the long term and cost  fluctuating production needs to be charged to consumers to ensure  DOC producers sustainability. We do not expect a material impact  the credit profile Japfa because we believe this regulation is  short term. The loss was also partly be overcome by the advantage  Japfa higher than commercial livestock operations caused by  the high price of chicken with DOC volume restrictions. Fitch noted the  increase in the price of broiler chickens since the announcement of this new regulation. Nonetheless Fitch does not rule out the possibility that the regulations will  applied in a more loosely in the future to ensure  controlled supply rate and increase profits poultry farmers  small scale. Fitch believes it is unlikely that regulatory changes will affect the level of long-term profitability and credit profile Japfa  encourage downgrade.
