SYDNEY, April 30 (Reuters) - Stockland Corp Ltd <SGP.AX>, Australia's second-largest property group, said on Wednesday it expected to achieve 6 percent of earnings growth for the 2014 financial year, at the top of its guidance range, supported by strong residential business.

The positive outlook in its quarterly update came a week after Stockland's all-script bid for smaller peer Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX> was rejected, and may add pressure on the target company. [ID:nL3N0NF0EE]
