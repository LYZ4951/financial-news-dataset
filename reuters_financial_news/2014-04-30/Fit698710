April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings today launches "Ratings Navigator" - a new one-stop visual overview of all the factors affecting a bank's rating, their relative importance and likely direction of movement. Fitch's "Ratings Navigator" lays out clearly the factors affecting the rating  and provides a visual comparison with peers' business mix, lending type, asset  quality, earnings and profitability, capital and leverage and funding and  liquidity. It also demonstrates how these factors combine to form the overall  rating. The tool replicates the rating framework outlined in Fitch's Global  Financial Institutions Rating Criteria. "We are frequently asked to explain the various constituents of a bank's  rating," says David Weinfurter, Global Head of Financial Institutions at Fitch  Ratings. "Fitch's Ratings Navigator shows the factors behind the rating and  includes a robust peer comparison that greatly enhances the value of our ratings  and research. This is the first time this level of analysis has been available  in such a clear, concise and easily comparable visual format." "While investors want to know what rating we assign to a credit, they really  want to understand why we think what we think," says Ian Linnell, Global  Analytical Head, at Fitch Ratings. ""Fitch is committed to pairing robust data  with sophisticated analysis, and Ratings Navigator does this through a powerful  and intuitive format that shows what is driving our ratings." Fitch rates approximately 6,000 financial institutions, including 3,500 banks  and over 1,100 insurance companies, and over 1,700 corporates globally. The  Ratings Navigator will initially be available for a number of financial  institutions, and will later be expanded to Fitch's global corporate and  insurance ratings sectors.
