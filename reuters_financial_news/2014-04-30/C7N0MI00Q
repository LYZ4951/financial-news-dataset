COPENHAGEN, April 30 (Reuters) - Jyske Bank <JYSK.CO>, Denmark's second-biggest bank by market capitalisation, missed first-quarter pretax profit forecasts due to falling revenues and higher writedowns on loan.

The bank said on Wednesday pretax profit dropped 25 percent to 418 million Danish crowns ($77.4 million), far short of analysts' forecast of 763 million crowns. [ID:nL6N0NF2VB] It did not give an outlook for the full financial year.
