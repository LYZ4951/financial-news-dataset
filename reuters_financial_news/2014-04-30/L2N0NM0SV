April 30 (Reuters) - WellPoint Inc <WLP.N> said on Wednesday during a conference call that it had spent $50 million on hepatitis C drugs during the first quarter.

That was the total amount the company spent in 2013 on treatments, it said. Gilead Sciences <GILD.O> introduced Sovaldi this year, and with its $84,000 price tag and high cure rates, it has been closely watched by insurers tracking expenses.
