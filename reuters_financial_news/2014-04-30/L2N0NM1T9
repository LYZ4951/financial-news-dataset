NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based mutual funds committed $2.3 billion to bond funds in the week ended April 23 on continued outperformance in bonds this year, data from the Investment Company Institute showed on Wednesday.

The inflows into bond funds more than tripled the previous week's inflows of $659 million, which were the lowest inflows in 10 weeks, according to data from ICI, a U.S. mutual fund trade organization. Stock funds attracted $3.5 billion in the latest week.  The inflows marked the 11th straight week of new demand for bond funds. Municipal bond funds attracted $531 million, marking their biggest inflows in six weeks, while taxable bond funds attracted $1.7 billion, marking their biggest inflows in three weeks.  Analysts have said that outperformance in bonds this year has lured investors back into the funds after massive outflows in 2013. The benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index is up 2.45 percent this year through Tuesday, beating the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> stock index's gain of 1.6 percent over the same period.  Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks attracted $1.4 billion of the net inflows into stock funds, while funds that mainly hold non-U.S. stocks attracted $2.1 billion.  The benchmark S&P 500 recovered 0.7 percent over the holiday-shortened weekly period after some strong corporate earnings from companies such as General Electric Co <GE.N> and Netflix Inc <NFLX.O> drove a rebound in equities. The index had fallen 1.5 percent over the previous two weeks.  Hybrid funds, which can invest in stocks and fixed income securities, attracted $944 million in new cash, marking their lowest inflows in three weeks.
