ISTANBUL, April 30 (Reuters) - Turkey's Yapi Kredi bank posted a first quarter net profit of 487 million lira ($230 million) on Wednesday, down 10 percent on the previous year but beating the average forecast in a Reuters poll.

The result compared with a net profit of 541 million lira a year ago, but came in above the poll forecast of 459 million.
