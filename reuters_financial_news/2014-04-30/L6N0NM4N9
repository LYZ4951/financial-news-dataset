TIRANA, April 30 (Reuters) - Albania's central bank held its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 2.75 percent, it said on Wednesday.

The bank has cut the one-week reverse repo rate by 250 points since mid-2011, in an easing cycle designed to revive an underperforming economy while keeping annual inflation in a range of 2 to 4 percent.
