April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Andromeda Finance S.r.l.'s class A2 notes and the underlying rating (without the benefit of SACE SpA (A-/Negative) of the class A1 notes at 'BB'. The Outlook is Negative.  The affirmation reflects the project's stable operating and financial  performance in line with Fitch's base case expectations. The Negative Outlook  reflects continuing regulatory and fiscal pressures.   Fitch has also affirmed A1 notes' 'A-'rating (with the benefit of a SACE  guarantee), Outlook Negative, in line with SACE's rating.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Operating and Financial Performance In Line With Expectations  The project has now accumulated three and a half years of operating history and  production performance remains strong, confirming the reliability of the energy  production forecast. In 2013, electricity production exceeded P50 by 6.6% and  was 9.2% higher than Fitch's base case, which incorporates a 2% haircut to P50.  Revenue Risk (Volume) was assessed as Stronger as per Fitch's 'Rating Criteria  for Solar Power Projects': although the project does not yet have five years of  operating history, production has always been above P50 and displays low  variability around the P50. Availability of photovoltaic (PV) plants has been  above 99%. The company reported a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.37x  and 1.4x as of September 13 and March 14, respectively - in line with Fitch's  base case expectations. Higher than expected production in 2013 was partially  offset by lower than expected wholesale prices.  Depressed Market Prices  Average wholesale price obtained by the project in 2013 was EUR56/MWh - some 15%  below Fitch's base case expectation. Wholesale power prices are expected to  remain depressed in the medium term. Only 15% of the project's revenues now come  from the sale of electricity at market prices, while 85% are from the fixed  feed-in-tariff (FiT) under the Italian regulatory framework for solar plants  (Conto Energia).Regulatory and Fiscal Pressures Persist  Substantial increases in renewable capacities in Italy in the context of a  severe economic downturn have created a burden on consumers who ultimately cover  the cost of the FiTs. The sector is characterised by increased political risk  and the expectation that it will need to adapt to less favourable operating  requirements and economic incentives due to the greater focus on the  sustainability of renewables. The project company continues to receive fixed FiT of EUR346/MWh with no  reported delays in payments. However, Andromeda has been affected by milder  regulatory and fiscal pressures which erode its cash flow. During 2013, the  project company made an accrual of EUR181k for 'imbalancing charges' payable to  GSE in line with the new regulation on production forecasting. The company also  had to absorb the cost of inverter upgrades requested by the grid company and  higher taxes as a result of some changes in tax regulations. To date financial  performance was only marginally eroded as a result.  Further additional changes  to operational requirements, tax charges or incentive payment terms, however,  would have incremental effects and could eventually depress free cash flow to a  level no longer in line with the current rating level.   Debt Metrics Tighten Further  Debt metrics as per updated projections reduce marginally as a result of higher  taxes and slightly lower projected market prices. Average debt service coverage  ratio (DSCR) is 1.22x under Fitch's base case (down from 1.24x a year ago).  Under Fitch's more conservative rating case, which is based on 1y P90 production  estimate, an additional 5% haircut to the market advisor's price forecast and a  0.75% long term panel degradation rate, the decline of the average DSCR is to  1.11x from 1.14x previously.  We view this rating case as a conservative  scenario in the context of positive operational performance to date.Fitch assessed the key rating drivers in accordance with the 'Rating Criteria  for Solar Power Projects' as follows: Revenue Risk (Price) - Midrange, Revenue  Risk (Volume) - Stronger, Operating Risk - Midrange, Debt Structure - Midrange.   RATING SENSITIVITIES:  - Negative: Electricity generation persistently below the P50 estimate, or below  the 1y P90 estimate for several periods; higher-than-expected failure rates or  operating costs; further declines in market prices; material adverse changes in  the regulatory framework affecting PV installations.  - Positive: Recovery of market prices supported by revised market advisor's  forecast.   The Outlook could be revised to Stable in the case of regulatory stabilisation -  a longer track record of how 'imbalancing charges' are applied and at least a  year of no incremental changes to operational requirements, tax regulations or  other regulatory mechanisms.
