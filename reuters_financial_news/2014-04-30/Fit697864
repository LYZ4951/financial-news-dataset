April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Loan performance for GSE risk-sharing mortgage deals has been positive so far, according to Fitch Ratings in a new monthly report.'Since the first risk-sharing transaction was issued last year, issuance has been steady and performance has been excellent,' said Managing Director Grant Bailey. To date, seven risk-sharing transactions have come to market, with quarterly  issuance expected from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Delinquencies so far  have been paltry, with only 23 basis points (bps) of mortgage loans past due as  of the most recent distribution date. 'The clean payment behavior to date  reflects the high credit quality of the borrowers,' said Bailey. Fitch's new monthly report tracks the performance of the risk-sharing  transactions issued by the GSEs and provides a summary of the bond and  collateral performance.
