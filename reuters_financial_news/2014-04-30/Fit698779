April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings hosted a conference on Turkey today in  London, with a combination of presentations and panel discussions. Below are  some highlights from today's presentations: Paul Rawkins, Senior Director, Sovereigns "Turkey ('BBB-/Stable') has a strengthening public debt profile, track record of  fiscal consolidation and low general government debts. Its banking system is  rated investment grade by Fitch, and supervised by an effective regulator. It  also has a dynamic non-bank private sector with proven export market flexibility  and moderate household indebtedness.  However these strengths are countered by a  highly volatile economy reflecting overdependence on external capital inflows,  and high and volatile inflation.  Tighter monetary policy is starting to have an  impact on macro-economic imbalances, but Turkey faces a challenging external  environment exacerbated by heightened political risk. Local elections in March showed that the AKP's popular support remains  undiminished,, but concerns over the absence of checks and balances and the rule  of law continue. Heightened political risk could discourage capital inflows and  untimely policy reversals are possible." Janine Dow, Senior Director, Financial Institutions Turkey's banks are being challenged by a volatile operating environment.  However, in Fitch's opinion, acceptable credit fundamentals and reasonable loss  absorption capacity support the sector's ratings.  "Margins have been squeezed following a sharp hike in interest rates. Loan  growth has slowed and expansion is expected to weaken in the face of tougher  regulation and waning confidence. Funding structures appear fairly robust  although Fitch notes a rising trend in market funding dependency. Liquidity  looks comfortable. Although foreign currency wholesale funding (which represents  20% of funding) looks potentially more vulnerable, the sector is largely deposit  funded. Available foreign currency liquidity appears ample and rollover rates of  international bank funding are high. Turkish banks continue to issue senior  bonds on the international markets which is positive. Capital ratios are  weakening but low leverage at most of the banks boosts confidence."  Bashar al-Natoor, Director, Corporates "Turkish corporates are operating within a harsh environment, as most rated  Turkish corporates are importers of raw materials; energy, and intermediate  goods, margin pressure from rising costs is likely to be seen across the market.  The exact impact of the devaluation of the Turkish lira varies by issuer.   Fitch expects muted debt issuance in 2014, and continued dependence on  short-term domestic bank financing over the next 2-3 years, which will limit  credit profiles. Financing costs and coverage ratios are likely to exceed recent  averages. In 2013 many Turkish blue chips like Arcelik and Koc took advantage of  global liquidity and investor appetite to issue FX-denominated long-term debt,  diversifying their funding base.  Fitch also notes that there are no big bullet  bond repayments due in 2014."  Clara Hughes, Senior Director, Insurance "The Turkish insurance market is growing strongly, driven by economic growth,  favourable demographics, urbanisation and an expanding middle class. Turkish  insurers have benefited from a period of political stability and policy  decisions and incentives that have encouraged savings and the use of insurance.
