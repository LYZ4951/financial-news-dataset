COPENHAGEN, April 30 (Reuters) - Denmark's largest pension fund ATP posted a net profit of 4.25 billion Danish crowns ($787 mln) in the first quarter, up from 3.29 billion a year ago, driven primarily by equity investments.

Investment activities made a profit of 4.05 billion in the quarter. "Equities and bonds were the main contributors to performance, but infrastructure and real estate investments also made positive contributions," chief executive Carsten Stendevad said in the earnings report.
