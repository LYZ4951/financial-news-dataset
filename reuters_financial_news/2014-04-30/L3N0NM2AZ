SYDNEY, April 30 (Reuters) - David Gonski will take over as chairman of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> from retiring John Morschel, effective May 1, the bank said in a statement.

Gonski, who has been working closely with Morschel to enable a "smooth transition", served as a director at Australia's third-biggest bank for five years from 2002. Gonski was on the committee that appointed CEO Mike Smith, with a mandate to chart out an Asia-focused strategy for the bank. That strategy has helped it grow the proportion of earnings it gets outside Australia, while its rivals focus on cost cuts.
