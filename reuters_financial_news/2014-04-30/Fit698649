April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hyundai Capital Auto  Funding VIII Limited (Hyundai VIII) and Hyundai Capital Auto Funding IX Limited  (Hyundai IX). The transactions are securitisations of auto loans in South Korea  originated by Hyundai Capital Services Inc. [HYMTRD.UL] (HCS; BBB+/Stable/F2).  The rating actions are as follows: Hyundai VIII USD79.0m class A notes due 2016 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Hyundai IX USD136.3m class A1 notes due 2017 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable USD136.3m class A2 notes due 2017 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect adequate credit enhancement (CE) and stable portfolio  performance with low delinquencies and defaults since the previous rating action  in May 2013. Fitch does not expect delinquencies or defaults to increase  significantly over the next 12 months given the expectation of continued low  unemployment and strong economic activity in South Korea. In addition, each of  the transactions has entered their controlled amortisation period, providing  stronger CE levels over time, which contributes to overall greater rating  stability. The three-month average delinquency ratio of each transaction has remained low  at less than 0.06% since the previous rating action at May 2013, significantly  below the 1.5% level at which would trigger an early amortisation event. The  three-month average default ratio was less than 0.02% as of February 2014 for  both Hyundai VIII and Hyundai IX, compared with the default ratio trigger at  1.3%, another trigger for early amortisation.  Hyundai VIII entered the controlled amortisation period in October 2012,  accumulating Class A note CE of 47.6% in February 2014. The available  subordination for Hyundai IX's Class A notes increased to 35.6% in February 2014  after entering its controlled amortisation period in August 2013.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch evaluated the rating sensitivities of each transaction under an increased  default rate scenario. An increase of the base-case default rate by 4.87x and  3.08x for Hyundai VIII and Hyundai IX, respectively, may lead to a downgrade of  the rated notes. The recovery rates, time to recovery and prepayment rates were  unchanged since closing in this sensitivity analysis.
