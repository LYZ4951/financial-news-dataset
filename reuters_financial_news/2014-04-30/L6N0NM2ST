BUDAPEST, April 30 (Reuters) - Hungary's national court can amend an unfair term in foreign currency loan contract, the European Court of Justice said on Wednesday in a ruling that could influence legislation to help troubled Hungarian foreign currency borrowers.

The case involved in the ruling had been referred to the court by Hungary's supreme court, the Kuria, which could make a ruling of its own in the second half of the year. The original lawsuit was launched against OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> by Hungarian borrowers who complained that they got a Swiss franc loan at the bank's buying exchange rate, but had to pay instalments and other costs at the selling exchange rate.
