April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised Gazprom-Media  Holding's (GPMH) Outlook to Negative from Stable and affirmed its Long-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB'. Its National Long-Term Rating was affirmed  at 'AA-(rus)' with Negative Outlook. GPMH is a diversified Russian media company, with most revenues and EBITDA  generated by its free-to-air channels, with a resultant high reliance on  advertising. The company's leading viewership market positions are supported by  its strong control over content. Fitch expects GPMH to maintain strong EBITDA  margins and positive cash flow generation.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Drives Negative Outlook Fitch expects higher debt on the back of its ProfMedia acquisition and EBITDA  pressures driven by NTV-Plus's market repositioning are likely to increase  leverage to above 1.3x net debt/EBITDA by end-2014 from 1.1x at end-2013  pro-forma for the ProfMedia acquisition. While the company retains flexibility  for deleveraging this would likely be contingent on a financial turnaround at  NTV-Plus.  GPMH has so far refrained from using its large cash cushion of RUB15.7bn on its  balance sheet at end-2013 for funding its acquisitions and debt reduction. Fitch  believes the company is likely to decide on the use of its cash balance by  end-2014. Substantial shareholder pay-outs or additional acquisitions driving  net leverage higher to above 1.5x net debt/EBITDA will likely lead to a  downgrade.   Strong Competitive Positions After its merger with ProfMedia at end-2013, GPMH strengthened its position as  the largest free-to-air TV group in Russia. The company estimated that including  ProfMedia channels it controlled 24% of all 18+ TV viewership in December 2013.  GPMH's portfolio of general interest (NTV), entertainment (TNT, TV-3, Pyatnitsa)  and thematic (2x2) TV channels is well-balanced, protecting against viewership  volatility at individual channels.Growth Prospects The short-term outlook for the TV advertising market remains positive with  ZenithOptimedia, an independent media consultant, expecting 6.5% growth in 2014.  In the medium- to long term the TV market growth is likely to slow but we expect  it to remain in the positive territory. We estimate GPMH is likely to perform  largely in line with the market.   Dependence on Advertising Revenues GPMH is highly dependent on advertising, which accounted for 82% of total  revenue in 2013. Advertising revenue is cyclical and is strongly correlated with  GDP, exposing the company to pronounced earnings volatility. This is,  nevertheless, mitigated by the company's proven resilience in a downturn. As  demonstrated in 2008-09, when the Russian economy contracted sharply, GPMH was  able to quickly respond with significant cost-cutting and re-cycling of  available content, which allowed it to maintain positive free cash flow.   NTV-Plus Turnaround a Challenge  NTV-Plus, GPMH's direct-to-home (DTH) underperforming subsidiary, changed its  strategy in 3Q13 to actively expand into a new segment of low-paying customers  in the European part of Russia. The company is well positioned to become a key  player in the mass market segment. However, its prior and on-going investments  in premium content may never be recouped while DTH competition in the mass  market segment is high.  Market repositioning is likely to entail substantial one-off costs in 2014, in  turn weighing on margins. NTV-Plus's longer-term success is not guaranteed. We  expect NTV-Plus to remain a financial underperformer at least in the medium  term. Internet Rise Minor Threat A rapid growth of the internet's share in the Russian advertising market to  above 20% has not significantly hindered robust TV ad market growth so far. We  believe significant further pressure from the internet is unlikely. Internet  advertising can be often viewed as a complimentary product targeted at a wider  range of customers rather than a direct TV substitute. TV remains the key  platform of choice for large advertisers valuing a fast nation-wide reach.   Strong Control over Content Fitch views GPMH's content strategy as reasonably balanced with an appropriate  mixture of internally produced and outsourced content. Its acquisition of  Central Partnership, a prominent domestic content production and distribution  company, under the ProfMedia deal increased the level of GPMH's content  self-sufficiency.  Russia has proven to be a market with clear preference for  domestically-produced, including entertainment and series, content. This reduces  dependence on foreign content and implies only limited FX risks. Also, this  reduces the threat from fragmented TV viewership with smaller players suffering  from sub-scale issues. This is because a fairly limited pool of domestic quality  content is typically shared between few large channels with only the remainder  available for niche channels.   Healthy Margins, Robust FCF GPMH has maintained robust FCF generation on the back of healthy EBITDA margins  - at well above 20% on average in 2010-2013. Fitch expects positive pre-dividend  FCF generation to continue. However, FCF will be pressured by continuing  investments in a new TV studio centre in 2014-2016.  Weak Parental Support GPMH group is 100% owned by Gazprombank. Fitch believes that a media group  cannot be viewed as a strategic asset for a bank, and therefore does not factor  in any rating uplift for parental support. A sale of GPMH would be viewed as  event risk, but the impact of a new shareholder may be limited.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may result in a negative rating action  include - A significant decline in viewership share/TV ad market share  - An increase of net debt/EBITDA to above 1.5x on a sustained basis  - Generous shareholder distributions including both one-off payments and a  change in dividend policy Positive: Future developments that may result in a positive rating action  include
