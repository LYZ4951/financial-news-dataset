April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned BOC Aviation Pte Ltd's [BKCHNO.UL] (BOC Aviation) proposed US dollar-denominated senior notes an expected rating of  'A-(EXP)'. The notes will be issued under the aircraft leasing company's USD5bn  euro medium-term note programme. The final rating is subject to the receipt of  final documentation conforming to information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated at the same level as BOC Aviation's 'A-' Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR). This is because the notes will constitute direct,  unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations of the company, and will rank  equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.  The IDR, presently on a Stable Outlook, reflects Fitch's view of a very high  probability of extraordinary support to BOC Aviation from its ultimate parent,  Bank of China Limited <601988.SS> (BOC; A/Stable).   RATING SENSITIVITIES Any perceived changes in BOC's propensity and ability to provide extraordinary  support to BOC Aviation would impact BOC Aviation's IDR and hence the issue  rating. Proceeds from the senior notes would be used for the company's new capital  expenditure and general corporate purposes.
