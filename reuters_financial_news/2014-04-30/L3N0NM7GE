SYDNEY, May 1 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to post modest gains on Thursday, underpinned by a stronger-than-expected earnings result from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and a rise on Wall Street, though a fall in metals prices may limit moves higher.

* Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZ.AX> posted a 15 percent rise in half-year net profit, slightly ahead of analysts' expectations on strong growth in its Asia business and a drop in bad debts. [ID:nL3N0NM7D4] * Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.3 percent, but was a 3.1-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark finished a tick higher on Wednesday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> slipped 0.2 percent in early trade. * The Dow closed at its first record high of 2014 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve gave an upbeat view of the economy's prospects as it announced another cut to its massive bond-buying program.  * Nickel prices rose overnight, posting their biggest monthly gain in 19 months on tight supplies. Copper slipped after disappointing data showed the U.S. economy barely grew in the first quarter as exports tumbled, while gold also fell.  * Mining giant Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> <RIO.L> said on Wednesday it had filed a complaint against competitor Vale <VALE5.SA>, Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz and BSG Resources (BSGR) over valuable mining concessions in Guinea. [ID:nL6N0NM66Q] *  Mirvac Group <MGR.AX> reaffirmed its FY14 operating earnings per share guidance range of 11.8 to 12 cents per stapled security.
