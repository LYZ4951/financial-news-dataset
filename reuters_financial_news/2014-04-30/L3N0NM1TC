SHANGHAI, April 30 (Reuters) - China's benchmark money rates rose this week in the run-up to a holiday week that will see markets closed Thursday and Friday, but dealers said conditions remain relaxed and they expect rates to fall again when trading resumes on Monday.

The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 4.10 percent in mid afternoon trade, up 58 basis points from last Friday's close and out of the 3 percent territory dealers consider accomodative. But a dealer at a city commercial bank in Shanghai said that long-term money rates were still easy, and said the rise in short term rates was likely due to short-term demand for cash to span the four-day market close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> stood at 2.5 percent, up over 16 basis points from last week, but the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS> was at 4.13 percent, down 26 basis points, supporting the dealer's argument that the stress was short-term. The People's Bank of China allowed funds to flow into the market on Tuesday, conducting a net injection of 91 billion yuan ($14.54 billion). On Tuesday it published its annual Financial Stability Report in which it released the results of a stress test applied to 17 systemically important banks. The bank said the results of the tests showed that China's financial system could handle a 400 percent increase in non-performing loans without much damage to capital adequacy ratios.
