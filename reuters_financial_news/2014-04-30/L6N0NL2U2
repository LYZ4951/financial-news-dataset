STOCKHOLM, April 30 (Reuters) - Telecoms operator 3 expects to increase its share of Sweden's competitive mobile market this year, the head of the company's Swedish unit told Reuters in an interview.

Operator 3 is the country's fourth largest after market leader TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST>, second placed Tele2 <TEL2b.ST> and Telenor <TEL.OL> in third, with a market share of 11.1 percent, industry data from 2013 showed. 3 Sweden, owned by Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa <0013.HK> and Swedish investment firm Investor <INVEb.ST>, has on average grabbed about one percentage point market share per year since starting its operations in 2003, and Swedish CEO Nicholas Hogberg believes that will continue in 2014 as well. "We see that we keep that pace," Hogberg said, adding that the growth rate in the corporate segment was somewhat higher than in the business to consumer segment. "We are a clear challenger in the Swedish market. We are perceived as a clear supplier of good data networks and that is where market demand has shifted to," Hogberg said about the firm's growth in recent years. The company also loses fewer customers than it used to, he added. 3 Sweden does not have a specific target for market share, and Hogberg focuses more on goals like cash flow and operating margin. "We are four big operators, so we should be able to reach 20-25 percent (market share over time), but growth is not our main aim. We shall deliver on what our owners want, and growth is part of that, but there are other parts as well," he said. In the first quarter, 3 Sweden gained 40,000 clients, while Telia lost as many mobile clients as 3 won, while Tele2 had a loss of 13,000 mobile clients in Sweden. Some of the clients 3 Sweden added in the quarter were generated by the firm's low price "Hallon" brand, Hogberg said.  3 has not given financial figures for the low-cost brand, which started operations in the spring of 2013, but Hogberg said customer intake has developed according to plan and that virtually all new Hallon customers previously were pre-paid customers with other operators.  NO RUSH TO CONSOLIDATE Hogberg said the Swedish market, with about nine million people and four major operators, is relatively crowded compared to many other European markets. Talk of consolidation has been around for years, but any major plans have yet to appear. "Over time, I'm sure something will eventually happen, but we are in no hurry," Hogberg said, adding that this would be up to the owners.
