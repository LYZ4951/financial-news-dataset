PARIS, April 30 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, France's biggest bank, warned it might be hit with a U.S. fine "far in excess" of the $1.1 billion it set aside last year to cover litigation costs linked to a potential breach of U.S. sanctions on countries including Iran.

"The discussions that took place during the first quarter of 2014 concerning U.S. dollar payments involving countries subject to U.S. sanctions demonstrate that a high degree of uncertainty exists," BNP said in a statement. "The amount of the fines could be far in excess of the amount of the ($1.1 billion) provision."
