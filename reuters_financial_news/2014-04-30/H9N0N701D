BEIJING, April 30 (Reuters) - Shanghai shares inched up on Wednesday after winners slightly outnumbered losers in a flood of first-quarter results released before the market closes for a two-day holiday.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.3 percent at 2026.36 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings ended flat. For April, the SSEC was down 0.3 percent while the CSI300 was up 0.6 percent.  The CSI300 healthcare subindex <.CSI300HC> gained 1.4 percent on Wednesday. Yunnan Baiyao Group Co Ltd <000538.SZ> jumped 2.8 percent after posting a 34 percent year-on-year increase in Q1 profit.  Shares in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) <601398.SS> declined 0.3 percent even as it beat estimates with a near 7 percent rise in first-quarter net profit.  The "Big Four" banks  all posted expectation-beating first quarter results, [ID:nL3N0NL2A6] but investor reaction has been muted, as concerns remain about bad loans and competition from online wealth management products.
