TOKYO, April 30 (Reuters) - Daiwa Securities Group Inc <8601.T> on Wednesday reported a 31 percent fall in fourth-quarter profit after investors lost enthusiasm in government economic policies that sparked a surge in stock prices last year.

Daiwa, Japan's second-largest broker after Nomura Holdings Inc <8604.T>, booked a net profit of 33.2 billion yen for January-March from 48.8 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.
