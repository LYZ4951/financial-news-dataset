MADRID, April 30 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest bank, BBVA <BBVA>, on Wednesday posted a 64 percent fall in first quarter net profit to 624 million euros, largely due to an unfavourable comparison after it booked gains from asset sales a year ago, though revenues also fell.

BBVA missed analyst expectations for a 715-million-euro net profit in the quarter in a Reuters poll. The bank said that stripping out one-off gains, its profit after tax would have been up 19 percent on a year ago, at 744 million euros.
