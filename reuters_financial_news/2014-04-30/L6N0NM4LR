DUBAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Dubai-based property developer Deyaar <DEYR.DU> said on Wednesday its first-quarter net profit more than doubled, buoyed by an upswing in the emirate's real estate market.

Deyaar made a quarterly consolidated net profit of 52.1 million dirhams ($14.2 million) compared to 19.4 million dirhams in the corresponding period in 2013. SICO Bahrain had estimated the company would make a first-quarter profit of 30.6 million dirhams. [ID:nL6N0N80VF]
