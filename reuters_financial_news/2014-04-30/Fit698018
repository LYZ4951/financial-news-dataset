April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised NN Group's (formerly ING Verzekeringen N.V. [INGVZK.UL]) Outlook to Stable from Negative. Its Issuer Default Rating (IDR), senior debt and hybrid debt have been affirmed at 'A-', 'BBB+' and 'BBB-' respectively. A full list of rating actions is provided at the  end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The Outlook revision reflects the finalisation of NN Group's new business scope,  following an amended European Commission restructuring agreement which requires  ING Group (A/Negative) to fully divest its insurance operations by end-2016.  The Outlook revision also reflects that uncertainty associated with the  divestment with respect to NN Group's insurance operations' franchise, business  position and future capital management strategy is now significantly reduced  with the completion of the divestment of insurance operations in America or Asia  (excluding Japan). NN Group's ratings continue to reflect its solid business position, especially  in the Netherlands. In addition, at 2.5x the regulatory minimum at end-2013,  capital adequacy exceeds the 'A' peer median while its financial leverage ratio  as calculated by Fitch at end-2013 materially improved to 25% from 32% at  year-end 2012. This improvement was mostly driven by proceeds from the disposal  of non-core insurance operations and a EUR1bn debt conversion into equity by ING  Group. Profitability continues to be a challenge for NN Group as illustrated by a near  breakeven net income for 2013 and a Fitch-calculated fixed charge coverage ratio  of 4.3x. Nevertheless, Fitch expects profitability to recover as of 2014 due to  the reduced impact of non-recurring items and management efforts to improve  underwriting results, notably through higher efficiency to mitigate the  unfavourable impact of the current low interest rate environment.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a rating downgrade for NN Group include a weakening  of the group's franchise, capital position or absence of profit recovery. This  would include a sustained drop in regulatory capital to below 200% of regulatory  minimum or repeated earnings volatility leading to underlying fixed charge  coverage ratio remaining sustainably below 5x.  In addition, the ratings could be downgraded if the financial leverage ratio  calculated by Fitch deteriorates to above 30%, if material investment losses  develop or if there is a weakening in the group's reserve strength. Conversely, the ratings could be upgraded if NN Group's profitability improves.  This would include a sustainable rise in the fixed charge coverage ratio to  around 10x while financial leverage and solvency ratios remaining at or above  current levels.  The rating actions are as follows:  NN Group N.V.  Long-term IDR affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook revised to Stable from Negative  Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F2'  Long-term senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'BBB+'  Short-term senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'F2'  Subordinated debt affirmed at 'BBB'
