PARIS, April 30 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> faces "uncertainty" over the size of a possible fine for breaching U.S. sanctions on payments involving certain countries, the French bank's chief financial officer said in an interview on Wednesday.

"There is uncertainty with respect to the amount and the nature of penalties the U.S. will impose," Lars Machenil told Reuters Insider television. Citing a $1.1 billion provision set aside by BNP for potential litigation costs, he added: "It's not impossible that the fine is far in excess of the provision."
