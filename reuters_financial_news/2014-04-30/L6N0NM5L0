ISTANBUL, April 30 (Reuters) - Turkish lender Akbank <AKBNK.IS> on Wednesday posted a net profit of 651.5 million lira ($307 million) for the first quarter, a 25 percent decline from the same period a year ago but nonetheless beating market expectations.

Akbank, controlled by Istanbul-based Sabanci Holding <SAHOL.IS>, had been expected to show net income of 582 million lira in the period, according to a Reuters poll of 13 analysts.
