TOKYO, April 30 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers cut allocations to stocks and increased those of bonds in their model portfolio in April on concerns about tension in Ukraine and the impact of further reductions of U.S. monetary stimulus, a Reuters poll showed.

The survey of eight Japan-based fund managers, polled between April 16 and 23, also found they raised the euro zone weighting within their bond portfolios to the highest level in three years. The overall allocations to equities fell to 42.3 percent - the lowest since 39.7 percent in June - from 44.9 percent in March. Their allocations to bonds rose to 50.1 percent - the highest since 50.4 percent in August - from March's level of 48.1 percent. Fund managers said stock markets faced potential threats, including possible escalation of the standoff between the West and Russia over Ukraine and an economic slowdown in China. "The firmness in global stocks is based on stability in (U.S.) interest rates. We should be mindful of the risk of adjustments and higher volatility in stocks if (U.S) interest rates rise," said a fund manager at a European asset management firm. Earlier this year, worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve may start raising rates sooner than expected hurt shares in many countries, especially those emerging markets that rely on foreign capital. U.S. equity prices also fell earlier this month, as investors pulled funds out of momentum stocks such as high-tech and biotech shares that had become very expensive. Within the equity portfolio, fund managers trimmed U.S./Canada weightings to 34.0 percent from March's 34.8 percent, which was a two-year high. "We cut U.S. stocks because their valuations are already high and there is limited room for their profit margin to improve from current record levels," said another fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm. The fund managers also reduced Japanese shares slightly, while increasing allocations of European and Asian stocks. "We cut Japanese shares, which don't have a catalyst for buying now. Instead, we increased European shares, which have higher dividend yields. We also selectively buy some emerging markets with good fundamentals that were sold too much," the asset manager added. A shift to Europe from the U.S. markets was more notable in bonds. Fund managers raised their euro zone weightings to 24.7 percent, bringing it back to the levels last seen in 2011, before the European debt crisis.  They slashed U.S. bond weightings to 23.5 percent, its lowest in five months, from 29.1 percent last month. "We want to underweight U.S. bonds, which have low yields in real terms, and overweight Europe, which have higher real yields," said the European asset management firm manager.
