SHANGHAI, April 30 (Reuters) - China's central bank is moving to regulate informal bond market makers who have long provided critical services in a legal limbo, people familiar with the plans said on Wednesday.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has drafted and circulated proposed rules to Chinese financial institutions detailing the conditions under which informal market makers can operate and how they should apply for promotion to formal market-making status, the people said. The PBOC's move would tighten supervision of the operations of some financial institutions and could lead to a larger number of formally authorized market-making institutions, the people said. That, in turn, could improve pricing and liquidity in Asia's largest bond market outside of Japan. China's informal market-making focuses on government debt. A market maker is a broker or dealer who holds a certain amount of securities at hand to facilitate trading, competing for orders by giving buy and sell price quotations, then filling orders rapidly either from its own inventory or an offsetting order. Market makers are needed for the speedy and efficient operation of any financial market, and the lack of them in some Chinese markets - in particular the over-the-counter exchanges - has been blamed for weak investor interest. China currently has 25 authorized market makers in its interbank bond market in Shanghai, including all major Chinese banks and some foreign banks such as the Citibank's China operations. They will not be impacted by the coming regulations. But there's also a large number of informal market makers who have been operating with tacit regulator approval, hoping to be promoted.  To date, these have been operating in a sort of regulatory vacuum, bond dealers say.  "We have operated as a trial market-maker for many years, but there have been no regulations to govern the field," said a dealer at a foreign bank in Shanghai. According to the people familiar with the plans, the draft rules say trial market makers must produce quotes in either direction for at least six bonds in a given day, produce quotes within 30 minutes after the market opens and must engage in quotation activity for at least four hours a day.
