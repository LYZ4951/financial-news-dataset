LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - The boss of Britain's biggest customer-owned lender Nationwide said he expects Britain's financial regulator to make a key measure of the amount of capital banks have to hold against their loans more onerous.

Nationwide Chief Executive Graham Beale said that he expected the Prudential Regulation Authority to eventually impose a leverage ratio of about 4 percent, higher than the 3 percent it currently applies. Leverage measures the amount of equity a bank holds as a percentage of its loans, without adjustments for risk. A 4 percent leverage ratio means that Nationwide can lend up to 25 pounds for each pound of capital it holds in reserve. "Looking at the strength of our business model and the trajectory of our capital ratio 4 percent would not cause me a problem over the medium term. I would say 3 to 5 years would not be uncomfortable for us," Beale said.
