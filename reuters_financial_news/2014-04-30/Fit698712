April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed Servus Holdco  S.a. r.l.'s 'B' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and Servus Luxembourg Holding  S.C.A.'s EUR315m senior secured notes, rated 'B+,' on Rating Watch Positive  (RWP). The rating action follows Stabilus' announced plans for an IPO.  Following discussions with Stabilus' management, Fitch notes that the IPO is  likely to materialise in the near future and will result in a reduction of debt  of around EUR63m. Fitch forecasts that funds from operations (FFO) adjusted  leverage will decline to a level below 4x by end of September 2014 (FY14),  albeit with interim debt fluctuations relating to short-term debt. The debt  reduction is expected to reduce interest expenses by approximately EUR5m per  annum, resulting in a FFO/interest cover ratio above 3x (2015 forecast: 3.8x).  At the same time, public listing will further diversify the funding sources  available to Stabilus and enhance the company's financial flexibility. With its last rating action as of 24 March 2014, Fitch had stated that further  implementation of the growth strategy and increasing geographic diversification,  FFO adjusted leverage sustainably below 4x and FFO/interest cover above 3.5x may  result in an upgrade. While it is still too early to evaluate the strategy  implementation, two of the upgrade triggers are expected to be achieved shortly  after the debt reduction takes place, making an upgrade possible. The remaining  senior secured notes will also benefit from improved recoveries following debt  reduction. Current performance of Stabilus is in line with Fitch's expectation  and free cash flow in 1HFY14 improved to EUR14m from a negative EUR6.1m in  1HFY13.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  Deleveraging Accelerates via IPO  Fitch had previously expected the FFO adjusted leverage of Stabilus to remain  near 4.5x due to cash requirements related to the execution of the expansionary  strategy. The IPO and the envisaged debt reduction of EUR63m will reduce  leverage to a level below 4x, while enhancing financial flexibility.  Discretionary cash-flow would increase due to lower interest payments.   Balanced, Resilient Profile Stabilus is the market leader in its main and commoditised product - gas springs  - with a significantly greater market share than its nearest competitors. As a  result, the company enjoys considerable economies of scale and sound cash  generation. The ratings are further supported by Stabilus' broad mix of mature  and growth products in both automotive and industrial applications, with limited  customer concentration. This helps provide a buffer against the high demand  volatility and cyclicality that characterise the mature markets Stabilus  operates in. Given Stabilus' high fixed-cost base a sustained decline in demand  would hurt profitability and cash flow generation.   Competitive Threats Remain Stabilus has successfully positioned itself as a favoured supplier of automated,  electro-mechanical opening and closing systems, and as a result, has become  increasingly important to OEMs' supply chains. However, in this segment,  Stabilus competes with larger and more diversified suppliers, which Fitch  expects will react to the company's ambitious growth plans. In addition, this  segment is likely to see higher R&D and capex requirements, which will hold back  the company's deleveraging efforts.   Cash Flow Fluctuation  Stabilus has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) margins over the past four  years and during 1HFY14. However, capacity expansion efforts are likely to  remain a strong cash drain, although this would be mitigated by reduced interest  expenses following its IPO and debt repayment. As with most industrial  producers, Stabilus experiences seasonal working capital volatility; outflows  are heaviest during the early parts of the year.   Sufficient Financial Flexibility Fitch views Stabilus' liquidity position as adequate with sufficient financial  flexibility. Stabilus had EUR35m of cash on balance sheet at end-FY1H14. In  addition, the group continues to have access to a EUR25m revolving credit  facility (RCF). Moreover, Stabilus has access to a factoring programme amounting  to EUR35m, of which EUR20m has been utilised.   Strong Credit Recovery The 'B+' notes are rated 'RR3', reflecting above-average recoveries. Recovery  rates for the remaining creditors are expected to improve as a result of debt  reduction. The notching between the IDR and the instrument rating may widen  further by one notch as a result.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  The ratings are likely to be upgraded by one notch if the proposed IPO proceeds  as planned, resulting in debt reduction of EUR63m.
