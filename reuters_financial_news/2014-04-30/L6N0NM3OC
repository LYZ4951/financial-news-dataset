COPENHAGEN, April 30 (Reuters) - Danske Bank's <DANSKE.CO> funding costs will be reduced after its rating has been raised by credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P), analysts said on Wednesday.

S&P raised Danske Bank's long-term rating to A from A- and the short-term rating to A-1 from A-2 late on Tuesday.  "This is good news as it will help [Danske Bank] to reduce funding costs," brokerage Nordea Markets said in a note to clients. S&P said the risk in Danske Bank's Irish business has been reduced, and that it expected loan losses to continue to decline. One of Danske Bank's financial targets, revised in October 2013, is to improve its rating from the three major rating agencies by at least one notch. "The upgrade from Standard & Poor's is a good step forward in our efforts to achieve our strategic goals," chief financial officer Henrik Ramlau-Hansen said in a statement. Alm. Brand Markets said in a note to clients that it expected Moody's, which has a positive outlook on Danske Bank, to raise its rating soon. Danske's return on equity (ROE) rose to 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, from 3.5 percent in the same period last year, but is still only about half of Nordic peer Nordea's <NDA.ST> 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter. "Although earnings remain weaker than those of its peers, we consider Danske likely to narrow that gap within the next two years," S&P analyst Alexander Ekbom said in a note. Danske Bank has a 2015 return on equity target of 9 percent. "Our rating currently incorporates a one-notch downward modification to reflect Danske's weaker earnings; an improvement could cause us to remove this adjustment," Ekbom said. But at the same time, S&P also lowered its outlook on Danske Bank to negative from stable due to a new framework agreement from the European Parliament that prevents governments from having to bail out troubled banks. "Accordingly, we believe that the potential extraordinary government support available to Danske's senior unsecured bondholders will likely diminish within our two-year rating horizon," Ekbom said.
