April 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings on three Philippine banks - Bank of the Philippine Islands <BPI.PS> (BPI), Development Bank of the Philippines [DBKPH.UL] (DBP) and Land Bank of the Philippines [LABKP.UL] (Landbank). The agency has also upgraded Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company's <MBT.PS> (Metrobank) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BBB-' from 'BB+' and its Viability Rating (VR) to 'bbb-' from 'bb+'. The Outlooks for all four banks are Stable.  At the same time, the agency has revised BDO Unibank, Inc.'s <BDO.PS> (BDO) Outlook to  Positive from Stable and affirmed its IDR at 'BB+' and VR at 'bb+'. A full list  of rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VRs, IDRs and National Ratings  The banks' Long-Term IDRs and National Long-Term Ratings are driven by their  VRs. The credit strengths of these five banks are their stable deposit bases,  liquid balance sheets, high core capitalisation, reasonable loan loss reserves  and satisfactory earnings. These ratings also reflect the structural issues that  all five banks and the Philippine banking sector face to varying degrees,  including their concentrated loan books, foreclosed properties with modest  reserves and developing corporate governance standards, and the presence of  conglomerates as controlling shareholders. BPI's ratings are supported by its strong domestic franchise, solid financial  performance, strong capitalisation and track record of prudent management  through economic cycles. The ratings of DBP and Landbank reflect their  satisfactory financial profiles, albeit with asset-related and state-influence  risks, including policy-oriented loans. Despite their policy roles, both DBP and  Landbank still adopt a largely commercial approach, including towards credit  risk assessment. BDO's ratings reflect its market-leading domestic presence,  funding strength, sound capitalisation and reserves, and modest but improving  profitability and asset quality. Metrobank's ratings reflect its established  domestic presence and funding base, satisfactory record in asset quality and  profitability as well as improved loan-loss reserves. The upgrade of Metrobank's ratings resolves the Positive Outlook assigned to the  bank last year, and reflects Fitch's view that the continued improvements shown  by the bank across a number of quantitative and qualitative indicators,  including the disposal of a large portion of its non-core assets, have improved  the bank's credit profile. Recent robust results have been aided by a favourable  operating environment and gains on asset sales. Non-core divestments have  reduced Metrobank's holdings in its associates to 5% of the bank's Fitch core  capital at end-2013 from 15% at end-2012. . The Stable Outlooks on BPI, Metrobank, DBP and Landbank reflect Fitch's  expectation that they will likely maintain steady risk profiles over the near-  to medium-term, underpinned by a robust domestic economy, manageable corporate  leverage and supportive domestic interest rates. Healthy domestic consumption  and growth in the manufacturing and services sectors should continue to drive  domestic demand. This, together with strong foreign inflows, is likely to fuel  brisk expansion of credit activities, including in property lending, which could  lead to disproportionate asset price inflation if left unchecked. Nonetheless,  Fitch's internal stress tests show that the large banks are in a good position  to weather reasonable deterioration in the operating environment due to their  sound funding and loss-absorption capacities. In addition, Fitch expects that  the central bank will likely take pre-emptive measures to mitigate excessive  risks building up within the system. The Positive Outlook on BDO reflects Fitch's view that recent overall  improvements in BDO's asset quality and profitability, underpinned by a  supportive operating environment, have brought BDO's credit profile closer to  those of 'BBB' range banks globally. However, BDO's loan growth has been  relatively higher than the industry in real estate-related lending, and around a  quarter of its trading portfolio is held in corporate bonds - which could make  the bank more vulnerable in a downturn. These factors, taken together with BDO's  core funding, liquidity and capitalisation strengths contribute to the revision  of BDO's Outlook to Positive.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - VRs, IDRs and National Ratings  Negative rating actions could occur should the banks' loss-absorption capacities  weaken in the face of event risks (such as large acquisitions), aggressive  growth plans or a material increase in risk appetites, including increasing  concentration of exposures and excessive lending to the volatile property  sector. However, because the 'BB+' IDRs of BDO, DBP and Landbank are at the same  level as their Support Rating Floors (SRFs), the IDRs will not be affected by a  downgrade of the banks' VRs, unless considerations underpinning their 'BB+' SRFs  also weaken.  Positive rating actions for the large Philippine banks may stem from sustainable  improvements in the broader operating and regulatory environment, including the  above-mentioned structural issues. Upgrade prospects are low in the near term  for BPI and Metrobank, whose ratings are presently the highest among the  Philippine banks rated by Fitch, and also high compared with major banks in  similarly rated countries. A higher SRF, possibly with a sovereign rating  upgrade would be likely to lift DBP's and Landbank's IDRs although this  likelihood is low in the near term hence the Stable Outlooks. An upgrade for BDO could occur following continued improvement in the bank's  profitability and asset quality, withprudent loan growth at sustainable levels,  and the bank's capital and funding strengths maintained. However, the Outlook for BDO may be revised to Stable, should the bank's  financial profile become vulnerable to a material build-up of risks in the  macroeconomic environment and domestic banking sector.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND RATING SENSITIVITIES - Support Ratings (SRs) and SRFs The SRs and SRFs of the five Philippine banks are the same at '3' and 'BB+',  respectively, reflecting Fitch's view of a moderate probability of extraordinary  state support available to them, if needed. Fitch believes that BPI, BDO and  Metrobank are systemically important in the Philippines on account of their  sizeable domestic deposit bases, while the same is true for DBP and Landbank due  to their 100% government ownership and quasi-policy mandated roles. A change in the government's ability to provide extraordinary support, which  could be indicated by a change in the sovereign ratings, would affect the SRs  and SRFs. However this likelihood is low in the near term as the Long-Term  Foreign-Currency IDR for the Philippines was recently affirmed at 'BBB-' with  Stable Outlook.  The SRs and SRFs will also be impacted by changes in the government's propensity  to extend timely support. One development that could lead to an adverse outcome,  for instance, is global initiatives to reduce the implicit state support  available to banks, although Fitch views this to be a longer-term risk for the  Philippines.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - Debt Ratings  The senior notes of BDO and DBP are rated the same as their Long-Term IDRs. This  is because the notes constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured  obligations of the banks, and rank equally with all their other unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations. Any change in the IDRs would affect these issue  ratings.  DBP's legacy perpetual hybrid notes are rated three notches below its VR,  reflecting the presence of both subordination and going-concern loss-absorption  mechanisms. The rating of these securities is ultimately sensitive to a change  in its VR.   The list of rating actions is as follows:  BPI Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable Long-Term Local-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AAA(phl)'; Outlook Stable Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+'  BDO Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Revised to Positive  from Stable Long-Term Local-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Revised to Positive from  Stable National Long-Term Rating upgraded to 'AA+(phl)' from 'AA'; Outlook Stable Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Ratings on senior notes affirmed at 'BB+'  Metrobank Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Long-Term Local-Currency IDR upgraded to 'BBB-' from 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Viability Rating upgraded to 'bbb-' from 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+'  DBP Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Long-Term Local-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA+(phl)'; Outlook Stable Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Ratings on senior notes affirmed at 'BB+' Ratings on legacy perpetual callable subordinated hybrid notes affirmed at 'B+'   Landbank Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Long-Term Local-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA+(phl)'; Outlook Stable Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3'
