April 30 (Reuters) - Stock futures have dipped a bit following a big miss from first quarter gross domestic product, although consumer spending was robust at a 3 percent gain.

Economic growth was a paltry 0.1 percent in the quarter - far worse than the anticipated 1.2 percent gain, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nLLAUFEARH] Other than consumer spending, key components of GDP were weaker than expected: business spending was down 2.1 percent, housing investment fell 5.7 percent, exports fell sharply, and government spending was lower. Futures have only been hit modestly by the news, though - the S&P 500 E-Mini contract was up a point or so before the report, and is now off by 2.5 points. Nasdaq E-mini futures have weakened a bit more substantially, but traders in that index have been more inclined to flee at the first sign of bad news.   From earlier in the day: 08:24 - U.S. index futures are retracing losses on Wednesday after a strong-than-expected reading of U.S. private employment gains in the ADP report for April. Ahead of the report futures had been modestly lower after a disappointing quarterly report card from Twitter <TWTR.K>. * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 0.25 points, about 0.0 percent, with just under 125,000 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are down 6.25 points, or 0.16 percent, on volume of 22,260 contracts. * The Dow industrials <DJc1> are up 13 points, or around 0.08 percent, with 14 contracts traded. * On Tueday, the S&P 500 <.SPX> rose for the second day in a row.
