MILAN, April 30 (Reuters) - Generali's <GASI.MI> Chief Executive Mario Greco said Italy's biggest insurer is planning to improve its dividend policy once it has met its key capital target.

Generali, Europe's third-largest insurer, doubled its dividend on 2013 but its dividend yield of 2.6 percent remained below that of major competitors like Axa <AXAF.PA> and Allianz <ALVG.DE>.  "Meeting the capital target is a priority. Once we have reached that, we will change our dividend policy and we plan to improve it," the CEO told shareholders at an annual meeting.
