DUBLIN, April 30 (Reuters) - The governor of Ireland's central bank on Wednesday said it was "absolutely crucial" that the government stuck to its fiscal targets following the country's exit from its EU-IMF bailout last year.

Patrick Honohan told a news conference that efforts to deal with mortgage arrears in the country were "broadly on track," but that it was unclear if Irish house prices were still undervalued after climbing 8 percent last year.
