STOCKHOLM, April 30 (Reuters) - Sweden's Stability Council will meet on May 23 to discuss ways of strengthening of the country's regulatory framework for the financial system, a finance ministry spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

Swedish authorities are concerned about high levels of household debt in the context of a banking system that has assets around four times the size of the Swedish economy. The government has already tightened capital rules for banks but has said it will take further measures to ensure lenders have sufficient buffers to meet any future crisis.
