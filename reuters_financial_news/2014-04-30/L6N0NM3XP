CAIRO, April 30 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound weakened at a central bank dollar sale <CBEO> and strengthened on the black market on Wednesday before a long weekend.

The central bank said it sold dollars at a cut-off price of 6.9976 pounds, weaker than the rate of 6.9900 pounds at its last sale on Monday.   Dollar shortages have fuelled a thriving black market, but the dollar rate slipped on Wednesday before a long weekend as people opt to wait until next week to buy.  A market participant said the dollar was being offered at 7.46 pounds on the black market on Wednesday, compared with 7.48 on Monday. The central bank sold $39.2 million on Wednesday, it said. It had offered $40 million.
