BEIJING, April 30 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator said on Wednesday that it had approved three applications of initial public offerings, ending a freeze on such approvals.

China halted new listings for 14 months from late 2012, in what some analysts said was a move to shield sluggish domestic equity markets from further downward pressure. The three approved companies are Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical Co., Ltd, Ellington Electronics Technology and Kuaijishan Wine Company, in which Zhejiang China Light & Textile Industrial City Group <600790.SS> has a 34 percent stake, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and Zhejiang China Light said in separate statements.
