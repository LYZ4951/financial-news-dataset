PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - President Francois Hollande and his Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg will meet General Electric GE.N chief executive Jeff Immet on Monday to discuss the future of French engineering group Alstom, a presidential official told Reuters.

The meeting follows news last week that GE is planning a $13 billion deal to buy Alstom's power turbines business, and comes after the intervention on Sunday of the French government and industry rival Siemens of Germany.(Reporting by Elizabeth Pineau; Writing by Andrew Callus; Editing by Andrew Roche)  Keywords: ALSTOM OFFER/HOLLANDE
