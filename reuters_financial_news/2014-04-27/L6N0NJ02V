CAIRO, April 27 (Reuters) - Egypt's Citadel Capital <CCAP.CA> said on Sunday it was selling its majority stake in the Sudanese Egyptian Bank to the Islamic Solidarity bank of Sudan for $22 million.

The move is part of a programme to shed non-core assets and focus on energy, transport, agrifoods, mining and cement, Citadel said. Its stake in the Sudanese Egyptian Bank was 66.1 percent.  Citadel, which has $9.5 billion under management, plans to shed holdings gradually outside those areas over the next few years and convert itself from a private equity firm into a holding company.
