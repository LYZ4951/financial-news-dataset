PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande gathered ministers on Sunday evening to discuss the case of struggling engineering firm Alstom <ALSO.PA>, with jobs, location of activities and energetic independence in mind, his office said in a statement.

The French government and Germany's Siemens <SIEGn.DE> intervened in U.S. giant General Electric's <GE.N> plan to buy Alstom's power arm earlier on Sunday by offering an alternative tie-up between European "champions" and a pledge to act in France's national interest. [ID:nL6N0NJ0QK]
