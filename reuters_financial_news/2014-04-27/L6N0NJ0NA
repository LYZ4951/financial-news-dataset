DUBAI, April 27 (Reuters) - An Abu Dhabi state-owned fund is financing a quarter of Etisalat's <ETEL.AD> 4.2 billion euro purchase of Vivendi's <VIV.PA> stake in Maroc Telecom <IAM.CS>, said three sources with knowledge of the deal, adding it should close this week.

The identity of the fund is a closely-guarded secret. The banks that will provide the remaining 3.15 billion euros of loan finance have not been told which of the emirate's state-owned entities is supplying the cash. The fund is most likely to be Mubadala [MUDEV.UL], the sources said, given that it already has telecommunications assets and an existing partnership with Etisalat in Africa.
