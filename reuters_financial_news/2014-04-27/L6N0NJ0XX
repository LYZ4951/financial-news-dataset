BEIRUT, April 27 (Reuters) - Lebanon's Bank Audi <AUDI.BY> reported first quarter net profit of $85.8 million on Sunday, the same level as the year-ago period.

The bank said in a statement that its net profit was driven by 12.2 percent growth in total income but that it had put aside $20.1 million of net loan loss provisions.
