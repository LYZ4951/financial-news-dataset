PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - Patrick Drahi said he plans to be chairman of the new company created by combining his cable group, Numericable <NUME.PA>, with Vivendi's <VIV.PA> SFR, although he has not yet decided on the top executive posts.

Asked about the new company's dividend policy, Drahi said his holding company Altice <ATCE.AS> did not pay one since it preferred to invest rather than give out dividends. "I do not have a dividend policy at this stage" for Numericable-SFR, he told a news conference on Monday. Asked if that meant the new company would not pay a dividend, he said: "We do not commit to paying a dividend."
