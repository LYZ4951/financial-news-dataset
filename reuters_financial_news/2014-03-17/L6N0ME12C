MILAN, March 17 (Reuters) - Russia's top oil producer Rosneft <ROSN.MM> is set to acquire an indirect stake in Pirelli <PECI.MI> after reaching an outline deal with a group of shareholders in the Italian tyre maker valuing its shares at 12 euros each.

Rosneft will own 50 percent of a new company which will buy holding company Camfin's stake in Pirelli, Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> said in a statement on Monday. Camfin currently owns 20.3 percent of Pirelli according to the website of market regulator Consob. The other 50 percent of the new company will belong to a company 80-percent owned by current Pirelli indirect shareholder Nuove Partecipazioni. Italian banks Intesa and UniCredit <CRDI.MI> will each own 10 percent of the new company. As part of the deal Italian private equity firm Clessidra will sell its stake in Pirelli, the statement said.
