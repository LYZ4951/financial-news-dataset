March 17 (Reuters) - Britain's Treasury plans to name Anthony Habgood chairman of the Bank of England's board, its governing body, on Tuesday, Sky News reported on its website.

The broadcaster, without citing sources, said the Treasury would appoint Habgood to the position on Tuesday morning and  replace David Lees, who has chaired the bank's board since 2009. (http://link.reuters.com/fet67v) Habgood, the outgoing chairman of Costa Coffee owner Whitbread Plc <WTB.L> and a former chief executive of business supplies distributor Bunzl <BNZL.L>, is not a career banker. However, he was on the board of National Westminster Bank prior to its takeover by Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> in 2000. The Bank of England and the Treasury could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours. A source had told Reuters on Monday that Britain's finance ministry would name a new BoE deputy governor for monetary policy to replace Charlie Bean on Tuesday. [ID:nL6N0ME4CD]
