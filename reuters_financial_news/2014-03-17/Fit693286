March 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings  and Rating Outlooks to the Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A notes: --$230,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf'; --$132,000,000 class A-2A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$393,000,000 class A-2B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$375,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$120,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$70,290,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$65,550,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Credit Quality: Credit quality for the pool is consistent with that of  recent pools. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. <FICO.N> (FICO) score is 745 and  WA original term is 33.2 months; 81.44% of the pool consists of leases with  terms of 36 months or less. The pool is geographically diverse with  approximately nine months seasoning, and comprises 100% new vehicles. Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: 2014-A is a sequential-pay structure.  Initial hard credit enhancement for the class A, B, and C notes totals 20.40%,  15.90%, and 11.70%, respectively, consistent with 2013-B. Consistent Lease Maturities: 2014-A consists of 73.45% undiscounted base  residual value (RV), in line with prior pools. The residual lease maturities are  well distributed, with a highest single-month period in December 2015 accounting  for 6.28% and 54.01% of the pool maturing within two years from the  transaction's close. Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has remained strong  in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from  increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realizations during  the life of the transaction. Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates Ford's (the parent of Ford  Credit) and Ford Credit's long-term IDR 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook. Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates good  capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer. This is evidenced by  historical delinquency, credit, and residual value loss performance of its  managed portfolio and securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable of  adequately servicing 2014-A.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or increases in  the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could  produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in  negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the  ratings assigned to Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2014-A to increased credit and  residual losses over the life of the transaction.  Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to  increased defaults and credit losses, showing downgrades of one rating category  under Fitch's 1.5x base case loss scenario. Additionally, downgrades of one or  two rating categories were seen under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss)  scenario.  The transaction shows significantly more sensitivity to residual loss  volatility. As such, under its severe residual loss scenario, Fitch would expect  to downgrade the class of notes by two or more rating categories.
