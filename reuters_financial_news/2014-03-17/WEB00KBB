VIENNA, March 17 (Reuters) - Ailing Austrian state bank Hypo Alpe Adria said on Monday it had redeemed a 750 million euro ($1.04 billion) bond after the government last week granted a quick capital injection to enable the repayment.

"The bond was redeemed this morning as previously announced," a spokesman said. Austria last Wednesday approved the capital injection for the bank with its Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger, saying the state would stand behind the loss-making bank. [ID:nL6N0M91OK]
