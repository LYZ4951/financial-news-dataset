LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Bankers working on Vodafone's <VOD.L> $10 billion deal to buy Spain's Ono could pocket up to $62 million in advisory fees, according to an industry estimate, the latest windfall for dealmakers in the technology, media and telecom (TMT) sectors.

Vodafone Group Plc <VOD.L> said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy Spain's largest cable operator Ono, as the British group rebuilds its European operations with a broadband offering. [ID:nL6N0ME2TF] Vodafone adviser Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and Robertson Robey Associates, who assisted the company's board, will share fees of between $22 and $27 million, Freeman Consulting, which tracks bankers' fees, estimated. Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, who acted as lead adviser for Ono shareholders, will receive the lion's share of a $28 to $35 million fee pool. The remainder will be split with co-advisers Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>, UBS <UBSN.VX> and JPMorgan <JPM.N>. TMT has been a particular bright spot for investment banks so far this year, thanks to several high-profile deals including Comcast's <CMCSA.O> $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable <TWC.N> and Facebook's <FB.O> $19 billion acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp. [ID:nL2N0LI05U][ID:nL3N0LP3WU].   Year-to-date, global M&A activity in TMT is up 186 percent to $266.9 billion based on 1,424 deals, compared with $93.2 billion over 1,589 deals a year earlier, Thomson Reuters data shows. Total worldwide M&A activity so far in 2014 is up 48 percent t $627 billion, according to the data. Fees earned by TMT bankers have risen accordingly, jumping 18 percent on a year ago to $893.9 million, Freeman estimated. By contrast, fees earned by bankers across M&A are broadly flat year-on-year at $4.3 billion. Thomson Reuters data ranks Morgan Stanley as the top investment bank in TMT M&A, having worked on deals worth $113 billion, including the pending Comcast and Facebook deals. Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, an adviser to both Vivendi <VIV.PA>  and Numericable <NUME.PA>, which are now in exclusive talks over telecoms unit SFR, takes second place. [ID:nL6N0MB0LM] Freeman estimates that the nine banks that worked with Numericable could earn fees of between $43 million and $52 million. Those advising Vivendi, including Lazard <LAZ.N> and BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, could share between $51 million and $59 million.
