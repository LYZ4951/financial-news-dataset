March 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has finalized its criteria for analyzing loans securing U.S. RMBS under the qualified mortgage (QM) standards and Ability-to-Repay rule (the Rule) recently adopted by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB). Fitch has developed assumptions regarding the probability of challenges to the  Rule (and/or QM status) as well as the potential costs or damages. The  assumptions reflect a low probability/high severity scenario. 'We expect some  defaulted borrowers will likely challenge the Rule, but a lack of legal  precedent could make the first few cases high profile and prone to significant  legal costs,' said Senior Director Suzanne Mistretta. Fitch will make upward adjustments to its credit enhancement calculations if the  originator designates the loan as higher priced QM (HPQM) or non-QM. Loans  identified by the lender and confirmed by third party due diligence as safe  harbor QM (SHQM) will not receive an adjustment. Fitch assumes that the maximum number of borrower challenges for HPQMs and non  QM loans is the pool's lifetime probability of default (PD) derived from Fitch's  mortgage loan loss model. This population is narrowed further to reflect only  those borrowers likely to default within five years of origination. The  likelihood of challenge is also driven by whether the foreclosure process is  judicial or non-judicial based on the state in which the property is located.  The PD assumption is the starting point for challenges to the Rule. As such,  'lower credit quality pools will see a larger effect on credit enhancement  relative to higher credit quality pools primarily due to their higher  probability of default and smaller loan balances,' said Mistretta.  Fitch will differentiate between structures that provide for expenses to be paid  from available funds and those that deduct expenses from the mortgage pool's net  weighted average coupon (Net WAC). Where trust expenses are paid from available  funds, additional subordination will be expected. Where expenses are absorbed by  the pool's Net WAC and the note rate is capped at the Net WAC, Fitch will not  adjust its loss expectation for the pool. Although expenses are borne by both  senior and subordinated investors, this provision does not affect the trust's  ability to pay contractual amounts due.  The loan designation and determination of potential challenges and legal costs  and damages will be highly dependent on the results of Fitch's review of the  originator's/aggregator's underwriting guidelines and origination processes. The  Rule applies to all mortgages for which loan applications were received on or  after Jan. 10, 2014. The Rule requires lenders to make a reasonable  determination of a borrower's ability to repay the loan at the time of  consummation.  In addition, depending on the loan product, features and pricing,  the Rule affords creditors (and their assignees) varying degrees of protection  against borrower disputes in the form of a safe harbor or rebuttable presumption  of compliance with the Rule. The finalization of the criteria follows the conclusion of Fitch's request for  comment made in Fitch's Nov. 12, 2013 special report 'U.S. RMBS:  Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule Approaches" .
