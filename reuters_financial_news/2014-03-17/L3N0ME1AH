SEOUL, March 17 (Reuters) - Seoul shares ended higher on Monday, buoyed by bargain-hunting following last week's steep losses though escalating tensions in Ukraine and worries about China's growth prospects limited gains.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.4 percent at 1,927.53 points, following a 2.8 percent drop last week.
