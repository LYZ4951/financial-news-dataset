LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - British investment banking boutique Shore Capital <SGRS.L> said on Monday its full-year pretax profit more than doubled as investors became increasingly interested in small and mid-sized firms.

Guernsey-based Shore, which provides research and corporate broking services and is the third-largest market-maker on the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L>, reported pretax profit for the year to Dec. 31 of 5.4 million pounds ($9 million), compared with 2.5 million a year earlier. Full-year revenue increased by 9 percent to 35.8 million pounds, the company said.
