LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - European shares were buoyed by gains in major German stocks Siemens <SIEGn.DE> and RWE <RWEG.DE> on Monday, steadying after heavy losses in the previous week on concerns about geopolitical tensions in Ukraine.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which fell 3.2 percent last week, rose 0.2 percent to 1,286.72 points in early session trading, while the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> also gained 0.3 percent to 3,013.97 points. Siemens rose after JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the stock to "overweight" from "neutral", while RWE advanced as traders welcomed a deal to sell its oil and gas production arm DEA [RWEDE.UL] to investors led by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman for 5.1 billion euros ($7.10 billion). [ID:nL6N0ME15S] Traders took a vote in Crimea at the weekend in favour of annexing the region from Ukraine - a move Western powers have said is illegal and will lead to sanctions against Russia - in their stride, with some arguing that they did not expect any immediate escalation in the tensions.
