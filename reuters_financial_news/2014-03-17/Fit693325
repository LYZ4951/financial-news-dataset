March 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed PT Tower Bersama Infrastructure Tbk's <TBIG.JK> (Tower Bersama) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings at 'BB'. At the same time, the agency affirmed the National Long-Term Rating at 'AA-(idn)'. The Outlooks for the ratings are Stable. A full list of rating  actions is at the end of this commentary. Fitch affirmed the ratings notwithstanding Tower Bersama's FFO-adjusted net  leverage remaining above 4.0x, the threshold at which a negative rating action  may be considered. Tower Bersama's FFO-adjusted net leverage was 5.4x at end  December 2013, following higher debt to fund telecommunications tower building  activity during 2013. However, the agency expects leverage to return below its  negative guideline in the medium-term thanks to rising cash flows from long-term  contracts with EBITDA margins above 80%. The risk of higher leverage is also  offset by a stronger customer portfolio, with a higher proportion of revenue  from investment-grade operators. 'AA' National Ratings denote expectations of very low default risk relative to  other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default risk inherently  differs only slightly from that of the country's highest rated issuers or  obligations.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Growth Keeps Leverage High: Tower Bersama's leverage in 2013 remained high,  mainly driven by higher borrowings to fund new base station sites for orders  from telecommunication operators, especially PT Telekomunikasi Selular  (Telkomsel, BBB/Stable). Tower Bersama's base station tower building activity  reached its peak in 2013 with 1,800 towers built (2012: 1,144). Fitch expects  leverage to remain above our negative guideline of 4.0x in 2014 and 2015.  However, Fitch believes that this will not be sustainable and FFO-adjusted net  leverage will fall below 4.0x in 2016. Acquisitions May Slow Deleveraging: As the second-largest telecommunications  tower provider in Indonesia in terms of the number of towers, Tower Bersama has  limited opportunity to acquire smaller tower portfolios from other tower  companies. However significant tower acquisitions might materialise if operators  such as PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (BBB-/Stable), PT Indosat Tbk <ISAT.JK> (BBB/Stable) and PT XL Axiata Tbk <EXCL.JK> (XL, BBB/Stable) decide to divest their tower  portfolios. In Fitch's view, any opportunistic acquisitions would result in  slower deleveraging than the agency currently expects and put further pressure  on the rating. Better Tenant Mix: Tower Bersama's customer portfolio has improved, with revenue  contribution from investment-grade telcos increasing to 75% in 2013 from 70% in  2012. The better quality of Tower Bersama's tenant mix offsets its higher  leverage. It is rated at a similar level as the largest telecommunications tower  provider in Indonesia, PT Profesional Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Protelindo,  BB/Stable), which has FFO-adjusted net leverage of below 4.0x but derives less  than 50% of its revenue from investment-grade telcos. Although Tower Bersama continues to face risk from its exposure to struggling  CDMA players, Fitch expects that tenant composition will further skew towards  investment-grade operators as they continue their investments in network  expansion. We also expect revenue contribution from investment-grade telcos to  further rise to above 75% after XL completes its acquisition of PT Axis Telekom  Indonesia in March 2014.  Solid Margin, Predictable Cash Flows: Tower Bersama's ratings benefit from its  solid profitability and revenues that are backed with long-term non-cancellable  contracts. Tower Bersama posted EBITDA margin of 81.9% in 2013, up from 81.5%in  2012. The company's cash flows are also highly predictable with locked-in  revenue of USD1.9bn at end September 2013, with average contract period of its  portfolio at 7.3 years. Strong Access to Funding: Tower Bersama's liquidity is further supported by its  strong access to bank borrowings with USD262m in unutilised working capital  facilities. The company also has a track record in bond markets with both local  currency and foreign currency issuances. The company plans to gradually replace  secured debt at the operating company level with unsecured debt at the holding  company level. In addition, the company plans to minimise its currency exposure  by having more rupiah-denominated borrowings. Currency Exposure Is Manageable: Tower Bersama has about USD887m in  foreign-currency debt, forming 81% of its overall debt. More than 90% of its  debt is protected through a combination of hedging contracts and a natural hedge  from USD40m in annual revenue (18% of total revenue). The company recorded  IDR854bn (USD75m) of cash (including restricted cash) at the end of December  2013 in which USD56m was denominated in US dollars.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch expects no positive rating action as the company's leverage will remain  high in the medium-term.  Negative: Future developments that could individually or collectively lead to  negative rating actions include: - A debt-funded acquisition of another tower portfolio or lease defaults by  weaker telcos leading to FFO-adjusted net leverage remaining above 4.0x on a  sustained basis.  - A fall in revenue contribution from investment-grade telcos to below 50%. - Any event that causes Fitch to revise its projections, such that Fitch no  longer forecasts the company's FCF to turn positive in 2015.
