JERUSALEM, March 17 (Reuters) - Bank Leumi <LUMI.TA>, Israel's second-largest bank, said it would issue fourth-quarter financial results on March 31, more than a week after it had initially intended in order to include results of a key holding.

Leumi was slated to publish quarterly earnings on March 20 but conglomerate Israel Corp <ILCO.TA>, in which it holds 18 percent, is not reporting results until later in the month. Leumi said on Monday Israel's banking regulator agreed to delay implementation of a new rule tat would require Israeli banks to report earlier in the month. This new rule will be implemented in the first quarter of 2014. Israel's largest bank, Hapoalim <POLI.TA>, will publish its results this Thursday.
