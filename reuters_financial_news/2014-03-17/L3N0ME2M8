March 17 (Reuters) - Beauty products retailer and distributor Sally Beauty Holdings Inc <SBH.N> said "fewer than 25,000" credit-card records may have been taken in a recent data breach.

The company said on March 5 it discovered that its network had been hacked but added no card or customer data appeared to have been stolen. [ID:nBwfs7w4a] Sally Beauty said on Monday that an investigation by forensics firm Verizon had discovered the evidence that card payment data may have been removed. [ID:nEOL2f8NKM] "As experience has shown in prior data security incidents at other companies, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the scope of a data security breach/incident prior to the completion of a comprehensive forensic investigation," Sally Beauty said. "As a result, we will not speculate as to the scope or nature of the data security incident," the company added.Hacking has become a major concern for retailers in the United States.  Target Corp <TGT.N> said in December that some 40 million payment card records were stolen along with 70 million other customer records during a cyber attack over the holiday shopping season. [ID:nL2N0JX2OA] Target said last week that the security breach could have been more extensive than reported. [ID:nL2N0MB1E0]
