March 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Emeco Pty Ltd's USD335m senior secured notes due 2019 a final rating of 'BB-' with a Recovery Rating of 'RR3'.  The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 27 February  2014 and follows a review of the final documentation, which materially conformed  to the draft documentation previously received. Emeco Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Emeco Holdings Limited <EHL.AX> (Emeco, B+/Stable). The notes are secured by the assets of the Emeco Group, and guaranteed by Emeco  and some of its subsidiaries. Proceeds from the notes will largely be used to  refinance existing debt of about AUD350m. The 'RR3' recovery rating assigned to  the notes reflects our expectation of at least a 51% value recovery for the note  holders in the event of default, based on the agency's assessment of the  liquidation value of Emeco's rental fleet and other assets under a stressed  situation. As a result, under Fitch's recovery rating methodology, the bond is  rated a notch above Emeco's Issuer Default Rating (IDR). Emeco's ratings reflect the high sensitivity of its earnings to commodity  cycles, due to its position as a rented equipment supplier to mining companies.  The ratings also take into account Emeco's low operating leverage, Fitch's  expectation of an improvement in Emeco's financial profile, and Emeco's  flexibility in managing capex, which allows it to preserve operating cash flows  during industry downturns.   KEY RATING DRIVERS High Cyclicality: Emeco's focus on mine production provides more stable revenues  compared to exploration and new mine development, although the ability of mining  counterparties to cancel contracts, typically between 30 to 180 days, brings  with it volatility and asset underutilization. This explains Emeco's 30% drop in  EBITDA in the financial year ended June 2013 (FY13) and Fitch's expectation of a  further 50% drop in EBITDA in FY14.  Rental Fleet Utilization to Improve: Emeco's overall utilization has trended  downwards since early 2012, driven by weak volumes in its Australian coal  business. Coal miners have been reducing overburden removal volumes in response  to weak global coal prices. Fitch does not expect this trend to continue and  expects the utilization rates of Emeco's assets to improve - Emeco's Australian  business is already showing signs of picking up. It has secured new contracts  which should help increase its utilisation rates in Australia to about 50% in  June 2014, up from 40% in the six months to 31 December 2013. Diversification: In FY13, 61% of revenue was generated in Australia, with coal  (both thermal and metallurgical) making up 42% of revenue. Earnings derived from  Australia are volatile due to the generally high cost of Australian thermal coal  on a global scale. Coal production has remained buoyant, although coal  producers' response to weak commodity prices has been to optimize productivity  and reduce costs by lowering strip ratios, by mining in areas that require less  removal of overburden. However, Emeco's geographical diversification has helped  it redeploy its fleet of 700-odd vehicles among different industries and  regions, which underpins its ability to optimize rental fleet utilization. High Quality Fleet: Emeco's strategy of disposing most of its equipment about  halfway through expected lifespans ensures it maintains a relatively young fleet  with low operating hours, which is attractive to mining companies. This, coupled  with the generic nature of most of its assets, aids in the resale of these  assets. Over the past seven years, the company has disposed of between AUD20m to  AUD50m of assets at generally above-depreciated value. The recurring nature of  these cash inflows helps to mitigate the volatility in operating cash flows.  Improving Financial Profile: Fitch expects Emeco to deleverage from FY14  onwards, due to both improving utilization and a substantially curtailed  expansionary capex spend. However, Emeco's leverage, as measured by net  debt/EBITDA, is likely to deteriorate in FY14, compared to 2.4x in FY13, mainly  due weak average utilization.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive rating action is not envisaged in the medium term. A meaningful  reduction in Emeco's portfolio risk profile, so that there is greater  geographical and commodity diversification, would be necessary before any  positive rating action were possible. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively lead to  negative rating action include:
