STUTTGART, Germany, March 17 (Reuters) - A German court on Monday dismissed a lawsuit by hedge funds seeking 1.36 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in damages from investment company Porsche SE <PSHG_p.DE>.

Two dozen hedge funds including Viking Global Investors and Glenhill Capital had accused Porsche SE of cornering the market in 2008 in shares of Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>. Plaintiffs had argued that throughout 2008 Porsche SE camouflaged its plans to acquire much-bigger VW and secretly piled up its holding in Europe's largest automaker.
