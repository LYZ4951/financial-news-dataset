LAGOS, March 17 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> firmed against the U.S. currency on Monday after the local unit of a foreign bank sold an undisclosed amount of dollars on the interbank market amid slowing demand for the greenback, dealers said.

The naira closed at 164.70 to the dollar, stronger than Friday close of 164.90. Dealers said the naira firmed after the foreign bank started to sell large dollar amounts, helping it recover from a low of 165.15 it touched during midday trade. The naira has been trading around 164-165 to the U.S. dollar over the past two weeks, supported by direct central bank interventions and dollar sales by some oil firms.
