March 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the rating on ITNL Offshore Pte. Ltd's [ITOSE.UL] (IOPL) CNY630m 5.75%  bond due April 2015  at 'BBB-'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Guarantee by EXIM: The affirmation is based on the continued, unconditional and  irrevocable guarantee of up to USD114m provided by Export Import Bank of India [EXIMB.UL]  (EXIM, BBB-/Stable). The rating is also supported by a principal account of  USD4m and a debt service reserve account (DSRA) amounting to one semi-annual  coupon payment of around USD2.4m. The guarantee is available on a pari passu  basis to both the bondholders and the provider of a swap to mitigate foreign  exchange risk. The claims of the bondholders will have preference over the DSRA,  while the principal account will be available on a pari passu basis to both the  bondholders and the swap provider.  Foreign Exchange Risk Mitigated: The foreign exchange risk - with the debt  obligation being in Chinese yuan while the guaranteed amount is in US dollars -  has been mitigated through a swap arrangement. The CNY630m 5.75% bond is swapped  into an USD100m 4.8% loan with Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE> (A+/Stable). If the swap  continues till the bond's maturity, there will be no exchange rate risk.  However, if the swap is terminated before the bond's maturity, IOPL has to pay  the swap holder a termination value based on adverse movement in exchange rates  (yuan depreciation) and interest (increase in the base rates). In this case, the  USD114m guarantee from EXIM and USD4m in the principal account, are expected to  be sufficient to meet bondholder payments as well as payments to the swap  provider at termination value, even under severe adverse movements in interest  rates and the yuan-dollar exchange rate.   Overcollaterisation Provides Additional Buffer: The transaction also benefits  from an overcollateralisation covenant, under which the sum of the bond's  US-dollar guarantee and the balance in the principal account (and adjusted for  the mark-to-market value of the swaps) must be more than 103% of the  yuan-denominated sum of the principal amount of the bonds and one half-yearly  interest payment. If the cover falls below 103%, then IOPL is required to fund  the principal account in US dollars such that the US dollar cover is at least  108% of the yuan amount. Currently the overcollateralisation is about 114% of  the yuan amount, providing significant headroom. Bond Proceeds Part Fund Acquisition: IOPL used the bond proceeds to extend an  USD89m loan (net of expenses and balances in the principal and interest  accounts) to its associate company ITNL International Pte Ltd (IIPL). IIPL used  the funds to repay part of the debt taken to purchase a 49% stake in Chongqing  Yuhe Expressway Ltd (Yuhe). IIPL's income mainly comes from dividends and  service fees from China-based Yuhe. Based on Fitch's estimates, it is unlikely  that the cashflows received by IIPL from Yuhe will be sufficient to meet its  interest costs over the next two to three years. The interest cost shortfall as  well as the principal repayment will have to be funded through debt and exposes  IIPL to refinancing risks. Keepwell and Cross Default Clause with ITNL: India's IL&FS Transportation  Networks Ltd <ILFT.NS> (ITNL) - IOPL's 100% shareholder - has entered into a keepwell  agreement with IOPL, under which, in the event that IOPL does not have  sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet any of its obligations,  indebtedness, liabilities, costs, expenses or other payment obligations, ITNL  will endeavour to make available to IOPL funds sufficient to meet such  obligations in full.  The notes also contain a cross-default clause that includes ITNL. Fitch views  ITNL's credit profile as being materially weaker to EXIM's credit profile. The  rating of IOPL's bonds is linked to the guarantee by EXIM based on the  aforementioned features of the transaction.
