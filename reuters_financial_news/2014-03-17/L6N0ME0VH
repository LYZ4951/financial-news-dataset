WARSAW, March 17 (Reuters) - Poland's Monetary Policy Council is likely to leave interest rates unchanged for the whole of 2014 before considering a rate hike next year, central bank governor Marek Belka was quoted as saying.

The central bank has cut borrowing costs by a total 225 basis points since November 2012, bringing its key interest to an all-time low of 2.50 percent. It signalled this month that rates will stay unchanged at least until end of the third quarter. "There are good reasons to expect rates unchanged until year-end," Belka told Bloomberg Businessweek Polska weekly newspaper published on Monday.
