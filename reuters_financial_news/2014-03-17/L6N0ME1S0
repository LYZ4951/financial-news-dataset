CAIRO, March 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Egypt's Oriental Weavers <ORWE.CA>, the world's biggest machine-woven carpet maker, hit their highest level since 2007 after the company said it was considering splitting its shares in a bid to boost their liquidity and trading volume.

Oriental Weavers, whose fourth-quarter results are due on Tuesday, said in a statement published by Egypt's bourse that it would ask its board to discuss splitting each share into five later on Monday. Shares in the company, which has a market cap of 3.79 billion Egyptian pounds ($544.5 million) jumped almost 7 percent to 45.00 pounds. Egypt revised regulation earlier this year to boost trading and attract more investment. A listed company no longer needs permission from the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority to split shares if it complies with pre-set rules. [ID:nL5N0KW3TH] ($1 = 6.9602 Egyptian Pounds)
