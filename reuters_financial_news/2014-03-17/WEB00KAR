FRANKFURT, March 17 (Reuters) - The chief executive of insolvent German property group IVG Immobilien <IVGG.DE>, Wolfgang Schaefers, has resigned as expected, setting the stage for its creditor-owners to install a new chief.

One of Germany's best known real estate firms, brought low by debts and cost over-runs, has proposed a debt-for-equity swap that will put the group in the hands of its creditors in February. Creditors will vote on the insolvency plan on Thursday. [ID:nL6N0LT213]
