March 17 (Reuters) - British media baron Richard Desmond is considering a stock market listing of free-to-air TV broadcaster Channel 5, Sky News reported, citing sources.

Desmond is working with investment bankers from Goldman Sachs <GS.N> on the possible floatation, Sky News said on its website, adding that the bank had taken the idea of listing Channel 5 to Desmond in recent weeks. (http://link.reuters.com/ban67v) Media reports in January said Desmond had hired Barclays to look for buyers for the television network and was expecting to raise about 700 million pounds ($1.16 billion) through the sale. [ID:nL6N0KB16I] Sky News said Barclays' concurrent sale had drawn interest from more than 20 potential buyers, including Discovery Communications <DISCA.O>, Scripps Networks <SNI.N>, Viacom <VIAB.O> and British Sky Broadcasting Group <BSY.L>, the owner of Sky News. Citing banking sources, Sky News said seven parties remained in the auction last week. Channel 5, which broadcasts 'Big Brother', was bought by Desmond's Northern & Shell media group in 2010 for 103.5 million pounds and made a profit of 20.6 million pounds in the first half of 2013, up from a loss of 16.1 million a year earlier. Representatives at Northern & Shell, British Sky Broadcasting, Discovery, Scripps and Viacom could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.
