PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - Numericable <NUME.PA> expects to achieve more than 1 billion euros ($1.39 billion) in savings through the takeover of Vivendi's <VIV.PA> SFR telecom unit, according to slides released at a Numericable news conference on Monday.

The synergies will come through migrating SFR broadband customers to Numericable, IT systems, marketing and backhaul, whereby mobile traffic is carried by fixed-line networks to get to its destination.
