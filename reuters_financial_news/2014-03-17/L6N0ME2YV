March 17 (Reuters) - French banks have about $50 billion of loans to Russia's public sector, companies and individuals, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), accounting for a fifth of foreign lending there and more than banks from any other country.

The European Union has imposed sanctions on some Russian officials and the EU and United States are expected to apply more economic penalties against Russia if a crisis over the Crimea escalates. [ID:nL6N0ME0TR] Russia's banking system is dominated by hundreds of local banks and some big domestic firms, including Sberbank <SBER.MM>, VTB <VTBR.MM> and Gazprombank <GZPRI.RTS>. Foreign banks have a limited role - the biggest are France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, Italy's UniCredit <CRDI.MI> and Austria's Raiffeisen <RBIV.VI>. A bigger issue for most foreign banks than retail banking exposure is likely to be any adverse effects on capital markets activity. Most of the world's big investment banks are involved in Russia and compete with domestic firms on trading, equity and bond issues and advisory work. Some big bond deals are under particular scrutiny at present, one banker said. Overseas banks had $242 billion of loans to Russia at the end of September, according to the BIS data, which tracks cross-border lending from 24 of the world's major countries. European banks accounted for $184 billion of the foreign lending to Russia, or 76 percent. U.S. banks had $36.7 billion of exposure and Japanese banks had $16.3 billion. In Europe, French banks had $50.9 billion of exposure to Russia. Italian banks had loans of $28.6 billion, German banks had exposure of $23.7 billion, British banks had $19.1 billion, Dutch banks had $17.6 billion, Swedish banks had $14 billion and Swiss banks had $6.8 billion, according to the BIS data. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ FACTBOX on U.S. banks' exposures to Russia: [ID:nL1N0M114Y] GRAPHIC on Russian exposure: http://link.reuters.com/xej67v Russia Eurobond request poses banks dilemma: [ID:nL6N0MB1J0] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Only SocGen, UniCredit and three other banks listed Russia as one of their top 10 country exposures under data released by the EU's bank regulator last year.
