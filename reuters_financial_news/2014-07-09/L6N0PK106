DUBAI, July 9 (Reuters) - Qatar's banking stocks could rise further on Wednesday after the second-quarter profit of the country's largest lender came in slightly ahead of analysts' estimates, while Dubai may continue consolidating after builder Arabtec ended its rally.

Qatar National Bank (QNB) <QNBK.QA>, whose results are generally seen as a bellwether for the sector's performance, said on Tuesday its profit rose 1.5 percent, while analysts had on average forecast a 2.7 percent decrease. [ID:nL6N0PJ2Q2] QNB reported its results after trading closed but the bank's shares rose 1.7 percent ahead of the announcement. Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan <MARK.QA> jumped 3.6 percent and Qatar Islamic Bank <QISB.QA> gained 2.9 percent. Meanwhile, Dubai may continue consolidating with a soft bias after shares in Arabtec <ARTC.DU> ended a sharp rise that market players said appeared to be due to a rush to close short positions. Arabtec edged up just 0.5 percent on Tuesday after soaring 61 percent in the previous five sessions. Its trading volume dropped, but the stock still dominates Dubai's turnover. In Saudi Arabia, retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair <4240.SE> may attract interest after it proposed doubling its capital through a one-for-one bonus issue funded by reserves and retained earnings.
