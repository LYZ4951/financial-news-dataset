MILAN, July 9 (Reuters) - Swiss-based bank UBS <UBSN.VX> downsized its stake in Italian mid-sized lender Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> to 1.8 percent from 4.05 percent on June 30, a regulatory filing by Italian market regulator Consob showed on Wednesday.

Carige said on Friday it had raised 798.2 million euros ($1.09 billion) in a highly-dilutive rights issue that was 99.9 percent subscribed, strengthening its balance sheet ahead of a European review of banking assets.[ID:nI6N0P600M]
