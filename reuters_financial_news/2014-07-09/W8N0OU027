BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Wednesday he expected a "positive decision" on state aid for Poland's flag carrier LOT [LOT.UL].

"I can anticipate that one (decision) that is being prepared for the next weeks, I don't know if before the summer break or immediately after the summer break, a positive decision will also be the Polish airline LOT," Almunia told a news conference.
