July 9 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's ratings service cut its rating on Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's (PREPA) power revenue bonds to 'B-' from 'BB', citing the corporation's inability to negotiate the renewal of its liquidity facility.

"We believe this increases the risk that the authority will attempt to restructure long-term debt, as a law passed in June allows," S&P said on Wednesday. (http://bit.ly/1mgxqqy) The ratings agency said PREPA's rating remained on CreditWatch with negative implications. S&P said the CreditWatch placement was pending the outcome of PREPA's negotiations with banks regarding the liquidity facility it used to buy oil.
