BOGOTA, July 9 (Reuters) - Colombia expects Moody's to raise its foreign debt rating as soon as this month, a finance ministry official said on Wednesday, as the economy continues to grow and the nation's fiscal accounts remain sound.

The rating agency will "hopefully" boost Colombia's  sovereign debt rating during July and there are "sufficient conditions" for an increase of two notches to Baa1, public credit director Michel Janna told Reuters.  Colombia regained its investment grade rating back in 2011 a decade after losing it. An improvement in security over the last 10 years helped boost economic growth and attract record foreign investment. The government will stick to its so-called fiscal rule that forces it to reduce its deficits each year until it has a balanced budget, Janna said.  "Hopefully this month Moody's will revise its rating," Janna said during an interview at his Bogota office. "There is a very strong case for an upgrade and I hope it will be two notches." An improved rating will likely help the government lower borrowing costs. Moody's could immediately comment. Moody's currently rates Colombia's sovereign debt Baa3. Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch rate the nation's foreign bonds BBB. Colombia surprised the market last month when it released a better-than-expected 6.4 percent economic growth in the first quarter, the strongest since 2007.   Faster growth has begun to nudge up inflation, which last year was at its lowest since 1955, and attract fresh overseas investment to Latin America's fourth-biggest economy. Output has been accelerating steadily over the past year due to an expansionist monetary policy which held the benchmark interest rate at 3.25 percent for 13 months until the hikes began at the end of April. The central bank has now raised the rate to 4 percent.  "The country is very well positioned macro-economically, and that's reflected in its growth figures, its inflation and its fiscal accounts," said Janna. "In terms of indebtedness, public debt at the moment is at levels that are very attractive and the market should take advantage of its yields." Janna said he expects the currency to weaken as investment  is drawn back to established economies and as efforts to stem gains in the currency take effect. The currency has strengthened 3.8 percent this year on top of a 9 percent increase in 2013, causing difficulties for exporters and manufacturers.  A strong inflow of foreign investment since J.P.Morgan in March boosted the weighting of Colombian bonds in two of its emerging market indexes, strengthened the peso further and bolstered capital markets. The peso has gained 9.4 percent since then. Foreign holdings of peso-denominated bonds, known as TES, has increased to 11.7 percent of the total, Janna said, from 7 percent before the JP Morgan weighting change. Some $4 billion has entered the market.
