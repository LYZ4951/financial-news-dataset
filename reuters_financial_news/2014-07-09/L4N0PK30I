July 9 (Reuters) - Philippine stocks fell to their lowest in nearly a week while other Southeast Asian markets remained rangebound as lower June inflation in China raised concerns over weak demand that could hurt growth in the world's second largest economy.

The Philippine index <.PSI> ended 0.6 percent weaker, its lowest since July 3, led by industrial and financial shares amid expectations of an interest rate hike. Although Philippine inflation slowed slightly in June, growing price pressures have been adding to expectations the central bank will raise interest rates for the first time in three years, possibly as early as this month. [ID:nL4N0PF0DN] China's consumer inflation cooled slightly more than expected in June, pointing to lingering weakness in the economy which could prompt Beijing to launch further stimulus measures to shore up growth. [ID:nL4N0PI2TO] "There are no compelling reasons to chase stock prices higher," said Song Seng Wun, a Singapore-based CIMB economist. "China's inflation picture remains stable, allowing the policy planners to continue with targeted easing to support the Chinese economy," he said. "No real reason to get excited. People are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, watching the annual China-U.S. strategic and economic dialogue and perhaps looking out for the upcoming release of the latest Fed Reserve's minutes from its 17-18 June 2014 FOMC meeting."  The Singapore index <.FTSTI> fell 0.2 percent, while Malaysia <.KLSE> ended 0.1 percent weaker with a foreign outflow of $16.88 million worth shares.   The Thai benchmark index <.SETI> recovered from early losses and ended little changed, while the Vietnam index <.VNI> ended 0.02 percent up.
