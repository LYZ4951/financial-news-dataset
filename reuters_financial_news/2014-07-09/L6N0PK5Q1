TRIPOLI, July 9 (Reuters) - The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the sovereign wealth fund of the North African oil producer, has appointed a new chief after his predecessor stepped down over a controversial political law, according to a statement on Wednesday.

Former Oil Minster Abdulrahman Benyezza has taken over as acting head of the fund, the LIA said. His predecessor Abdulmagid Breish quit after an investigation under a law which bans people from taking a public office if they had a function in the regime of late strongman Muammar Gaddafi, who was deposed and killed by rebels after an eight-month uprising in 2011. "Mr. Breish has therefore stepped aside, appealed the decision and remains confident of the eventual outcome," the LIA said in a statement. The law has been welcomed by some Libyans who suffered under Gaddafi, but is seen as a headache for the government because the country has few experienced technocrats after four decades of one-man rule. Libya badly needs stability and an end to chaos which has plagued the country since Gaddafi's overthrow. Top officials frequently get changed, hampering developing the desert country.
