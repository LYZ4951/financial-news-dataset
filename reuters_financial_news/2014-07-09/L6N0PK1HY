FRANKFURT, July 9 (Reuters) - Bundesbank banking supervision chief Andreas Dombret said the bank should report directly to the European Central Bank in its  supervision of big banks, bypassing German financial regulator BaFin, who it currently reports to.    "In my opinion, the Bundesbank must remain at the same level as the other supervisory bodies," Dombret said on Wednesday. "That is the only way we can have a functional supervision."
