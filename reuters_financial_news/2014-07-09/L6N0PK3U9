DUBAI, July 9 (Reuters) - Saudi British Bank <1060.SE> (SABB), the kingdom's fifth-largest listed lender by assets, posted a 15.2 percent increase in its second-quarter net profit, it said in a bourse statement on Wednesday, beating analyst forecasts.

The bank, an affiliate of HSBC Holdings <HSBA.L>, said it made 1.16 billion riyals ($309.3 million) in the three months ending June 30, compared with 1 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expected the bank to post an average net profit of 1.09 billion riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0PI1ED] The bank attributed its net profit advance to higher operating income - which rose 10.8 percent year-on-year to 1.66 billion riyals - without elaborating. Saudi companies issue brief earnings statements early in the reporting period before publishing more detailed results later.
