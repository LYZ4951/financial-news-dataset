CAIRO, July 9 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was steady at a central bank dollar sale on Wednesday but weakened on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Monday. The bank's rates have stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It offered $40 million on Wednesday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.37 pounds, fractionally weaker than Tuesday's price of 7.36 pounds.
