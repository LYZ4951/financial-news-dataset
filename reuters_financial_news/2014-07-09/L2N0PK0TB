July 9 (Reuters) - Harbinger Capital Partners has sued Dish Network Corp and its Chairman Charles Ergen, seeking at least $1.5 billion for allegedly trying to strip the hedge fund of its control of bankrupt wireless company LightSquared.

The lawsuit filed in a Colorado federal court on Tuesday accused Ergen of engaging in fraud and of violating a federal anti-racketeering law, according to court documents.
