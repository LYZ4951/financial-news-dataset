LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - UK car insurer Admiral Group <ADML.L> said revenues fell in the first half of the year and there was no firm evidence of a return to growth in UK car insurance premiums.

Group turnover in the six months to June was 1 billion pounds ($1.70 billion), down from 1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier, with total premiums down 9 percent.  Group customer numbers increased by 300,000 to 3.9 million over the period, while the number of UK cars insured rose to 3.1 million, it said in a statement. UK car insurance turnover fell, however, to 850 million pounds from 920 million pounds.
