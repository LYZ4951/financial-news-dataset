VIENNA, July 9 (Reuters) - Austria's budget deficit will not exceed the European Union's ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product this year despite the costs of creating a "bad bank" for nationalised lender Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL], the country's fiscal watchdog said.

"Even considering the restructuring costs for Hypo Alpe Adria ... the upper (deficit) limit will not exceed 3 percent," Bernhard Felderer, head of the Fiscal Council board, told a news conference at the release of its annual report on Wednesday. "You know we estimate (a deficit of) 2.7 percent for this year. We think a bit more will come but not to the extent that we will exceed 3 percent," he added. The Hypo bad bank to wind down around 18 billion euros in assets will push up the deficit and boost state debt to nearly 80 percent of GDP this year. [ID:nL6N0PJ3BT] One-off items including windfall revenue from a mobile telecoms frequency auction helped reduce Austria's state deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2013. The Fiscal Council estimated that Austria's structural deficit - which strips out one-off items - was 1.3 percent of GDP last year, above the government's 1.1 percent estimate.  The structural gap is likely to hit the medium-term target of 0.45 percent only in 2016, said Felderer, adding that Austria needed additional measures promised by the government in April to avoid significant deviations from the target path.
