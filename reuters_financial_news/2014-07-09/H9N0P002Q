HONG KONG, July 9 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares fell the most in two-half weeks on Wednesday, weighed down by weaker U.S. and China markets, with Internet giant Tencent <0700.HK> the biggest drag.

Sentiment was further hit after data showed China's consumer price inflation cooled slightly more than expected in June, pointing to lingering weakness in the world's second-largest economy.

The benchmark index had its worst daily loss since June 23 after hovering around the year's high for a week.
