WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed Julian Castro to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, placing the San Antonio, Texas mayor at the top of the agency at a time when the housing sector is recovering sluggishly.

Castro, a Democrat who was nominated by President Barack Obama, was confirmed on a roll call vote in the Democratic-led Senate. He will replace Shaun Donovan, who has been tapped to lead the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
