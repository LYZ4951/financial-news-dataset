July 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed DCS Asset Funding Pte Ltd.  (DCS) - a securitisation of credit card and charge card receivables in Singapore  originated by Diners Club (Singapore) Private Limited (Diners Singapore). The  rating actions are as follows:  SGD10m working capital facility due Sept 2016 affirmed at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable SGD100m class A1 fixed-rate notes due Sept 2018 affirmed at 'A-sf', Outlook  Stable SGD35.5m class A2 floating-rate notes due Sept 2018 affirmed at 'A-sf', Outlook  Stable SGD10.7m class B floating-rate notes due Sept 2018 affirmed at 'BBBsf', Outlook  Stable SGD8.9m class C floating-rate notes due Sept 2018 affirmed at 'BBsf', Outlook  Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects Fitch's view that the performance of the underlying  assets has remained well within expectations, and that credit enhancement (CE)  is sufficient to support the current ratings. The transaction benefits from the  continued strength of the Singapore economy and the tight labour market.  Monthly payment rates have been stable at above 20%, and the default ratio has  been tracking consistently below 1.0%.  Fitch expects delinquencies to remain stable as the portfolio's product mix is  expected to remain consistent going forward. The credit card and charge card  products comprise 87.5% and 12.5% of the portfolio, respectively, as of end-May  2014. The eligibility criteria Fitch uses to assess the underlying pool and the  agency's conservative base-case assumptions show the transaction has sufficient  protection for the current rating. This is reflected in the Stable Outlook.  According to the June 2014 servicer report, the three-month rolling average  delinquency ratio was 0.8%, well below the transaction's 3% early amortisation  trigger. The three-month average monthly net yield was 1.6%. The three-month average  payment rate was 20.6%, above the transaction's early amortisation trigger of  15%.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch considers the possibility of upgrade unlikely over the next 12 months. Based on Fitch's model, assuming the average payment rate of 20.6% and the  average annualised gross yield of 23.3% in the past 12 months to June 2014, the  ratings on the working capital facility, Class A1 and A2 notes would have been  able to withstand at least a 2.5x increase of the average annualised default  rate to 25.0% over the same period.  The ratings on the Class B and C notes would be able to withstand increases in  the average annualised default rate of at least 2.7x and 2.9x, respectively,  over the same period.
