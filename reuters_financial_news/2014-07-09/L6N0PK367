BERLIN, July 9 (Reuters) - Germany's monopolies commission on Wednesday urged the German government to sell its 17 percent stake in Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, which the state purchased as part of an emergency bail out during the financial crisis.

Commerzbank was one of the highest-profile casualties of the global financial crisis with the German government spending around 18 billion euros ($25 billion) to bail it out. "The monopoly commission actually urges that the state withdraw from Commerzbank," said Daniel Zimmer, head of the commission which advises the government on competition issues, while presenting a report. The government's stake represents an additional nuisance in a financial market already marked by numerous competitive distortions, the commission said. It made no sense for the government to sit on the stake in hopes of a better share price. The government has said it wishes to avoid selling the stake at a loss to taxpayers but that it had no plans to remain a long-term shareholder. Since the bail-out, Commerzbank has cut costs and sold assets, and returned to profit in 2013. But like rivals it is struggling with low interest rates and weak fixed-income markets, and also faces growing competition for its core mid-sized company customers - the backbone of Europe's largest economy.  Analysts calculate that the break-even price for the government would be around 26 euros per share, far from the current price of 10.94 euros. The bank's shares have shed almost 7 percent so far this year, underperforming the European bank index <.SX7P>, down 2 percent, but outperforming flagship Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, down 21 percent.
