HONG KONG, July 9 (Reuters) - China shares had their biggest fall in three weeks on Wednesday, with tech firms leading losses following a tumble overnight in U.S. markets.

China's consumer price inflation cooled slightly more than expected in June, data showed on Wednesday, pointing to lingering weakness in the world's second-largest economy. [ID:nL4N0PI2TO] The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 1.2 percent at 2,038.61 points while the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 1.5 percent. Both had their biggest daily loss since June 19 after closing at their three-week highs on Tuesday. Top CSI300 percentage loser was Iflytek <002230.SZ>, which dived 8.1 percent.
