LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - British house prices slipped unexpectedly last month after rebounding in May, although on an annual basis price growth continued to quicken, a survey from mortgage lender Halifax showed on Wednesday.

House prices fell 0.6 percent in June compared with the month before, when prices rose 4.0 percent. That undercut expectations for a rise of 0.2 percent in a Reuters poll. Halifax said house prices rose 8.8 percent in the three months to June compared with the same period a year ago, the second consecutive rise on an annual basis.
