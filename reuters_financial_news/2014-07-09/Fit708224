July 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded French-based foodservices company Elior SA's (Elior) (previously Holding Bercy Investissement SCA) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB-' from 'B+'. The ratings of Elior's senior secured credit facilities and Elior Finance & Co. SCA's EUR350m senior secured notes were upgraded to 'BB+' from 'BB-'. All ratings have been removed from Rating Watch Positive (RWP). The Outlook on  the Long-Term IDR is Stable.   The upgrade reflects the recent completion of a EUR954m initial public offering  (IPO) by the group, which has been used partly to repay secured bank and bond  debt. Fitch estimates Fitch-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) gross leverage  to decline to 5.2x post-IPO from 7.6x at the financial year ended September  2013. The ratio should remain at or below 5.0x thereafter. The upgrade of the  senior secured credit facilities and notes' ratings reflect enhanced recoveries  post IPO.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Declining but High Leverage The IPO of EUR954m (EUR785m of new shares and EUR169m of existing shares) would  have reduced FYE13 FFO adjusted gross leverage to a still high 5.2x from 7.6x.  Fitch expects credit metrics to show additional improvement by FY15, driven by  moderate organic sales growth and mild profit margin expansion as extraordinary  costs dissipate. Thereafter, any meaningful deleveraging will be predicated on  continued profit growth and Fitch does not expect any further material repayment  of debt prior to bullet maturities in 2019/2020.   Geographic Concentration Elior's geographical concentration in France and other southern European  countries remains a constraining factor on the rating relative to its closest  peers Compass (A-/Stable) and Sodexo <EXHO.PA> (BBB+/Stable), which maintain broader  geographical diversification.   Balanced Business Profile The ratings continue to reflect Elior's balanced business profile resulting from  its broad product offering, strong customer and business diversification, and  high barriers to entry in the catering sector. The group possesses several  company-specific traits akin to low investment grade business services companies  such as a broad range of services and customer diversification as well as a high  proportion of contracted revenues and low renewal risk.  In addition, Elior's public listing will further diversify the group's funding  sources and enhance its financial flexibility.  Strong Cash Flow Conversion The asset-light nature and low capital intensity of the business should allow  Elior to convert operating profits into positive cash flow before debt service;  Fitch estimates free cash flow (FCF) margin averaging 2% of sales over the next  four years. This should provide some financial flexibility, a key supporting  factor of the company's credit profile. However, FFO fixed charge cover is  expected to be 2.4x by FY15 (around 2.0x pre-IPO), which is at the lower end of  expectations for the 'BB-' rating.  Long-Term Outsourcing Trend The long-term trend toward outsourced foodservices is expected to support  continued sales and profit growth over the medium term.   Diversified Profit Drivers  Elior's contract catering and support services segment (representing 68% of FY13  group EBITDA) is a key anchor of the ratings. We expect profitability under  these contracts, which is largely P&L based (ie where the provider is paid for  the service and bears the costs), to remain steady in a low inflationary  environment while retaining any productivity improvements. We also expect  concession activities, accounting for one-third of group EBITDA, to remain  structurally more profitable, albeit more capital-intensive, than contract  catering over the next two years.   Adequate Liquidity Unrestricted cash of EUR260m at end-March 2014 (EUR210m at FYE13), together with  access to nearly EUR170m of undrawn revolving credit facilities post-IPO, is  sufficient to address business needs and moderate debt repayments for 2014 and  2015 of around EUR300m.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating actions include: - Additional diversification of operations either by operating segment and/or  geography -Further de-leveraging resulting in FFO adjusted gross leverage below 4.5x on a  sustained basis - FFO fixed charge coverage sustained above 3.0x (FYE13: 1.7x) - FCF/total adjusted debt margin above 12% (FYE13: Negative) Negative Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating actions include: -FFO adjusted gross leverage above 6.5x on a sustained basis - FFO fixed charge coverage below 2.0x on a sustained basis
