July 9 (Reuters) - Qatar Holding is set to slash its 15 percent stake in the owner of the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> by a third, ahead of the British company's $1.6 billion rights issue to help it buy U.S. indexes group Frank Russell, the Telegraph reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

The sovereign wealth fund on Wednesday instructed Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N> and Citigroup <C.N> to sell almost 5 percent in the LSE Group via an overnight accelerated bookbuilding, the daily quoted banking sources as saying.   Qatar Holding as well as LSE could not immediately be reached by Reuters for a comment outside of regular business hours in the UK.  The sale was part of "routine portfolio management," the paper said, quoting a statement it said was issued by Qatar Holding after the market closed. Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the investment unit of the Qatar government and the parent company for Qatar Holding, first bought 20.86 percent of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 2007. (http://reut.rs/VM5jW1) Based on the LSE Group's closing price of 1956 pence per share on Wednesday, the 4.83 percent being sold was worth 255 million pounds ($433.9 million), the daily said.  The shares were expected to be sold to a large range of institutions rather than a single buyer, the paper said, adding that the sale was likely to have been completed by the time the UK market opens on Thursday morning.
