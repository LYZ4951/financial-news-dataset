MUMBAI, July 9 (Reuters) - India's NSE index marked a 1-1/2 week closing low on Wednesday, continuing to retreat from the record high hit in the previous session, as investors pared positions in blue-chips such as Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> ahead of the federal budget.

Tata Motors provisionally fell 3.2 percent while Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> ended lower 2 percent.
