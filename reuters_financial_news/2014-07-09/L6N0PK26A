ATHENS, July 9 (Reuters) - Greece will open books to investors for a three-year bond later on Wednesday or Thursday at the latest, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The sale would follow Athens's successful return to the financial markets after four years in April, when it sold a five-year bond.  "The books are likely to open today (Wednesday) and at the latest, on Thursday," one of the sources said.
