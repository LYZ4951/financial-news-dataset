HONG KONG, July 9 (Reuters) - Units of Hong Kong's largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties <0016.HK> won two residential sites in the city for HK$4.19 billion ($540.67 million), the government said on Wednesday.

One Sun Hung Kai Properties unit outbid three other developers, including Henderson Land Development Company Ltd <0012.HK> and Sino Land Company Ltd <0083.HK>, to build residential buildings for HK$2.2 billion in the Tin Shui Wai area of Hong Kong's New Territories district. Two analysts had given separate forecasts of HK$2.3 billion and HK$3.3 billion for the site, which covers 75,500 square meters (812,675 square feet). Another unit from the company also won a separate auction, which attracted a total of four bids, for a smaller residential site in the same district for HK$1.96 billion, according to government data. The land sales, a barometer of developers' long-term confidence in the housing market, are part of the government's plan to tackle a housing shortage and rising home prices, which have jumped nearly 120 percent since 2008 in one of the world's most expensive property markets.
