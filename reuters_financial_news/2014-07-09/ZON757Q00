TORONTO, July 9 (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts rose in June, frustrating economists' expectations for a modest slowdown, though the previous month was revised lower, data released on Wednesday showed.

A report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp showed the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts rose to 198,185 last month from a downwardly revised 196,993 units in May.
