STOCKHOLM, July 9 (Reuters) - Sweden's Social Democrats are open to forced mortgage amortisation in Sweden to help counter fast-rising levels of household debt, the economic spokeswoman for the Social Democrats said on Wednesday.

"I absolutely think that is something interesting to discuss - I can see the point of a clearer amortisation requirement," Magdalena Andersson, widely expected to take over as finance minister should the centre-left opposition win September elections as polls predict, told journalists. Sweden's finance minister, Anders Borg, said last week the government wants to take a decision on amortisation demands at a financial stability council meeting in November.
