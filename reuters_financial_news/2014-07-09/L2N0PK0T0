July 9 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL] said on Wednesday it appointed Michael Walsh, the former head of a Visa Inc <V.N> payment management unit, as an adviser in its technology, media and telecommunications investment team.

Walsh was president and chief executive officer of CyberSource Corp, a payments company that Visa acquired in 2010 for $2 billion. Before joining CyberSource, he worked in enterprise software sales for Oracle Corp <ORCL.N> and in the private wealth management division of Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>. Warburg Pincus said Walsh will help the New York-based firm identify and evaluate investment opportunities in the payments sector around the world.
