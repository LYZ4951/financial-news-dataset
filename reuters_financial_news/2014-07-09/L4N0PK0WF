SEOUL, July 9 (Reuters) - South Korean shares had their worst day in almost two weeks on Wednesday after weak guidance from Samsung Electronics clouded the outlook for corporate earnings, prompting offshore investors to call a halt to a buying spree.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.3 percent at 2,000.50, the biggest one-day percentage drop since June 27, although market bellwether Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> added 1 percent on short-covering.  Its smartphone rival, LG Electronics Inc <066570.KS>, shed 4.9 percent on concerns about April-June earnings. Offshore investors snapped a nine-day net buying streak by offloading a net 61.2 billion won ($60.47 million) of KOSPI shares.
