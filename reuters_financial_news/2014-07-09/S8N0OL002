LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is likely to lower its estimate of the amount of spare capacity in Britain's economy, incoming BoE Deputy Governor Minouche Shafik said on Wednesday.

The BoE estimated the amount of slack in the economy was equivalent to between 1 and 1.5 percent of gross domestic product in its last two quarterly Inflation Reports.
