NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP <KKR.N> said on Thursday that its second-quarter earnings more than tripled year-on-year, exceeding most analysts' expectations, as a string of lucrative asset sales led to its highest dividend on record.

Like its alternative asset manager peers, KKR has taken advantage of the rally in equity and debt markets to sell some of its companies at high valuations. In April, it also acquired a specialty finance company it previously managed after agreeing to pay out that company's income as dividends. KKR said post-tax economic net income (ENI) per adjusted unit was 62 cents in the second quarter, up from 18 cents a year ago and higher than the 50 cents average forecast by analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll. KKR's dividend was 67 cents per unit, up from 42 cents a year ago. About a third of that came from its $5.8 billion sale of South Korea's Oriental Brewery Co Ltd to Anheuser-Busch InBev NV <ABI.BR>, the world's biggest brewer.

Overall, KKR's private equity portfolio appreciated 5 percent in the quarter. That is less than the 8.4 percent rise in the value of Blackstone Group LP's <BX.N> private equity portfolio but in line with a 5 percent appreciation in Carlyle Group LP's <CG.O> private equity portfolio. [ID:nL2N0PS0ES] KKR was also buoyed in the quarter by its acquisition of KKR Financial Holdings LLC (KFN), an investor in bonds and loans that it previously received fees to manage. The deal, which closed on April 30, means that KKR now receives all the investment profits on more than $2 billion of assets it used to manage for KFN. The acquisition of KFN also boosted the book value of KKR's balance sheet to $10.4 billion at the end of June from $7.8 billion from the end of December.  Huge by industry standards, the size of KKR's balance sheet is the legacy of the firm's merger in 2009 with KKR Private Equity Investors, a fund vehicle whose listing KKR then transferred to New York from Amsterdam in 2010.
