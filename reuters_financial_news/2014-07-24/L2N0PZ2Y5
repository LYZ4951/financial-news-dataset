NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based funds withdrew a net $7.6 billion from stock funds in the week ended July 23, marking their biggest outflows since early February, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

While mutual fund investors added a net $379 million to such stock funds, exchange-traded funds posted outflows of $7.97 billion. ETFs are thought to represent the behavior of institutional investors, while mutual funds are typically purchased by retail investors. Taxable bond funds attracted $2.78 billion in net inflows, marking their biggest inflows since late May.  Riskier corporate high-yield bond funds posted $2.4 billion in net outflows, marking their biggest outflows since June 2013.
