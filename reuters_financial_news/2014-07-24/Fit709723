July 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Mubadala Development  Company PJSC's [MUDEV.UL] (Mubadala) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), senior  unsecured rating at 'AA' and Short-term IDR at 'F1+'. The Outlook on the  Long-term IDR is Stable. Mubadala Development Company -GMTN B.V.'s (MDC) global  medium-term note (GMTN) programme and outstanding notes and MDC's euro  commercial paper programme (ECP) have also been affirmed at 'AA' and 'F1+',  respectively.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  State Support Fitch applies its parent and subsidiary rating linkage methodology in rating  Mubadala, concluding that there is a strong relationship between Mubadala and  the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (AA/Stable/F1+), resulting in the ratings being  aligned. Strong sovereign ties remain the primary rating driver for Mubadala.  Consistent State Funding As of FYE 2013, the company had received shareholder contributions from the  government totalling AED152.5bn.   Long-Term State Ownership Mubadala's 100% state ownership status is mandated by law and unlikely to  change. It can only be dissolved after 2052, 50 years from its formation, by  Emiri decree, or if its mandate is deemed complete. Established in 2002 through  Emiri decree No. 12, Mubadala is Abu Dhabi's primary business development  company.  State Development Strategy Mubadala's mission is to achieve economic returns while advancing the  government's long-term policy plans - the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. Abu  Dhabi wants Mubadala to drive economic and social development to ensure an  increase in wealth for future generations. Board membership includes five  members of the Abu Dhabi executive council, including the chairman, Sheikh  Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.   Unaffected by Public Debt Policy Explicit contingent liabilities are clearly delineated and the supervision of  the borrowing plans of government-related enterprises (GREs) and state-owned  enterprises (and consequently Mubadala's), has been tightened, with ultimate  authority still residing in the Executive Council (the Emirate's highest  government body). Abu Dhabi's ability to support its GREs and SOEs is not in  question. Potential contingent liabilities, notably support for other emirates,  is at Abu Dhabi's discretion and, as in 2009, is unlikely to be material  compared with Abu Dhabi's assets, if required. Fitch continues to apply its parent and subsidiary rating linkage methodology in  rating these entities, as we understand that the implicit state support from the  Emirate of Abu Dhabi [ABUDH.UL] has not changed. Fitch does not rate the fourth of the  emirate's largest SOEs - Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC <TAQA.AD> (TAQA) (for more  details, see 'Fitch: Major SOE Ratings Still Benefit from Abu Dhabi Support',  dated 24 October 2012 at www.fitchratings.com).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Mubadala's rating is currently equalised with that of Abu Dhabi. A negative  rating action could result from a downgrade of the sovereign, any change in the  implied support and commitment from, and ownership by the state of Abu Dhabi. A  significant change in Mubadala's operational structure or any potential  flotation of key operating assets would also prompt a review of the ratings. A positive rating action on Abu Dhabi, could lead to a positive rating action on  the issuer. For the sovereign rating of Abu Dhabi, Fitch outlined the following  sensitivities in its rating action commentary of 21 February 2014: The main factors that, individually or collectively, could lead to positive  rating action are: - Addressing deficiencies in structural indicators and strengthening  policymaking institutions, relative to peers, which would ultimately be  conducive to reducing the economy's dependence on oil.  - An improvement in the transparency and availability of key data. The main factors that, individually or collectively, could lead to negative  rating action are: - A sustained period of sharply lower oil prices that materially erodes fiscal  and external buffers, coupled with the crystallisation of significant contingent  liabilities.
