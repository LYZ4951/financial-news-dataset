Chief Executive Officer Thomas Borgen spoke with Reuters:  ABOUT STRATEGY: "We state clearly that Danske Bank is and will remain a Nordic universal bank. We see that we have a solid footprint across the region and it is both a strategic and economic rational for us to be in all Nordic markets."  "These countries offer exposure to stable AAA-countries. Our presence across the regions also gives us opportunities of selected pockets of growth."  "We have a four percent market share in both Norway and Sweden. We can see that with some investments we can really be a challenger in those markets. We will unquestionably be in those markets and develop those businesses further."  "The Norwegian operation is very profitable. Sweden is not very profitable and that's why we have to adjust the business model. We can really benefit from being a large bank cross-boarder on IT, product development and costs. We would like to become larger and due to the size of Danske, we can really make a difference in both Sweden and Norway."  "We will invest in the region of 200 to 300 million crowns over a five years period (in Sweden and Norway)."  ABOUT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT: "The second quarter results shows we continue to move in the right direction and we are executing on our strategy and making progress on all our targets."  "We have said we are aiming to give a 9 percent return to our shareholders in 2015 and in the longer term it should be 12 percent. I think what we have delivered today shows we are moving in the right direction. That said, there is still work going on but it is a good step in that direction."
