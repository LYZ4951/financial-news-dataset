DUBAI, July 24 (Reuters) - Gulf telecommunications stocks may take centre stage in the region on Thursday after a raft of earnings announcements from the sector, most of which were ahead of analysts' estimates.

Qatar's Ooredoo <ORDS.QA> reported an 11 percent drop in second-quarter profit, citing the conflict in Iraq and start-up costs for its business in Myanmar. Revenue from the Iraq unit, Asiacell, dropped 9.6 percent year-on-year to 1.6 billion riyals ($440 million) as the Islamic State militant group seized large swathes of the country in June. [ID:nL6N0PY4UB] However, at 817 million riyals, Ooredoo's net profit was still significantly better than expected. Two analysts polled by Reuters had forecast it would make a quarterly profit of 544.2 million riyals and 623.3 million riyals respectively. Wataniya <NMTC.KW>, Kuwait's second biggest telecommunications operator and an Ooredoo subsidiary, also reported a decline in second-quarter profit, which dropped 21.3 percent to 18 million dinars ($63.7 million), missing the estimate of EFG Hermes, which had forecast 20.19 million dinars. Another Ooredoo unit, Oman's second biggest operator Nawras <NWRS.OM>, posted a 32 percent jump in second-quarter profit to 9.9 million rials ($25.7 million), beating the estimate of Gulf Baader Capital Markets, which had forecast 9.2 million rials. Finally, du <DU.DU>, the United Arab Emirates' second biggest operator, reported a 15.6 percent rise in second-quarter profit, beating analysts' estimates by a wide margin. The firm made 547.7 million dirhams ($149.1 million); analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast 498.8 million dirhams. In other sectors, Commercial Bank of Qatar <COMB.QA> suffered a 3 percent decline in second-quarter net profit which was roughly in line with analysts' expectations. [ID:nL6N0PY40B] Most markets in the region will be closed for at least three days next week for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which is likely to make investors careful about their positioning.
