SEOUL, July 24 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> suffered its worst day in a week on Thursday after second-quarter economic growth came in weaker than expectations, raising chances of an interest rate cut as soon as next month.

The local currency <KRW=KFTC> closed down 0.48 percent at 1,028.6 against the dollar versus Wednesday's close at 1,023.7, snapping a three-day winning streak. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> ended nearly flat, quoted at 2,026.62 points at the end of Thursday's session, down 0.08 percent from Wednesday's close at 2,028.32. Foreign investors purchased a net 168 billion won ($163.39 million) worth of KOSPI shares, making them net buyers for eight consecutive trading sessions. LG Electronics Inc <066570.KS> gained 4.2 percent after it announced on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 26.5 percent from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates. [ID:nL4N0PW12E]
