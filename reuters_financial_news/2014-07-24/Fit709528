July 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published its end-June 2014 money  market fund (MMF) snapshot report and individual fund factsheets. They provide  consistent and comparable portfolio analytics across all Fitch-rated US and  European MMFs, which represent around USD1trn of assets under management. Individual fund factsheets provide investors with fund-specific portfolio  information, covering each fund's current and historical credit, liquidity and  market risk attributes. They also provide information on the fund manager, and  Fitch's rating rationale. They are published monthly. Fitch's MMF snapshot is a monthly publication of key portfolio analytics  allowing data comparison across MMFs. Underlying portfolio data is based on portfolio holding reports received from  fund administrators and managers as part of the agency's process for rating and  monitoring MMFs. Fitch applies a homogeneous methodology across funds to  classifications, issuers, credit quality, instruments types and indicator  calculation. Quarterly reports highlighting key MMF trends, exposures and allocation  developments complement the monthly factsheets and snapshot. Fitch's MMF factsheets are available free of charge through the following link:  https://www.fitchratings.com/web_content/pages/fam/mmf/fund-surveillance.htm or  through www.fitchratings.com >> Ratings and Research >> Financial Institutions  >> Fund & Asset Manager Ratings >> Money Market Surveillance box on the right  hand side column.
