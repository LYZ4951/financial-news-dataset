ROME, July 24 (Reuters) - The board of Italy's flagship airline Alitalia will propose to shareholders a capital increase of as much as 250 million euros ($336.68 million), a source with knowledge of document said on Thursday after a meeting of the airline's board.

"The board prepared a document for the shareholders meeting in which they are asked to approve a capital increase of 200 to 250 million euros," the source said.  Alitalia shareholders are to meet on Friday. Abu Dhabi's state-owned Etihad Airways has plans to buy a 49-percent-stake in the loss-making airline if it can meet certain conditions.
