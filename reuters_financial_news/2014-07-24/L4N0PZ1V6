July 24 (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Lancashire Holdings Ltd <LRE.L> reported a 53.6 percent jump in quarterly net premiums written, helped mainly by its acquisition in late 2013 of Lloyd's of London insurer Cathedral Capital Ltd.

Lancashire, which insures assets such as ships, aircraft and oil rigs, reiterated that it would likely return most if not all of its earnings to investors later this year. [ID:nRSX1704Na]
