WARSAW, July 24 (Reuters) - Poland's fourth-largest bank, mBank <MBK.WA>, is expected to report a 21 percent year-on-year rise in its second-quarter net profit, mostly due to a higher net interest income margin and lower financing costs, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.

The bank, which is controlled by German lender Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, may report a net profit of 328.5 million zlotys ($107 million) in the second quarter of this year, according to the average of forecasts given by 12 banks and brokerages. "We expect that mBank's profit has risen thanks to higher profits from its core activity and falling costs of risk," Erste Securities said in a report. Poland's central bank lowered interest rates by 1.75 percentage points to 2.5 percent in 2013, their lowest level in history, to help revive a sluggish economy.
