MADRID, July 24 (Reuters) - Spanish insurer Mapfre <MAP.MC> said on Thursday its first half net profit had risen 0.4 percent from a year ago to 458 million euros ($617.06 million), helped by growth in some pockets of its international business, such as in Brazil and Mexico.

It said premium income was flat from a year ago in the January-June period, at 11.8 billion euros.
