NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended July 23 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $2.4 billion to $1.026 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $3.9 billion to $1.051 trillion.
