CAIRO, July 24 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was stable at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday but strengthened on the black market ahead of the Muslim Eid holiday next week.

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Monday. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after it had allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.39 pounds, one trader said, weaker than the rate of 7.40 pounds on Monday.
