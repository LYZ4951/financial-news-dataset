July 24 (Reuters) - Two of Britain's biggest construction firms, Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> and Carillion Plc <CLLN.L> are in detailed discussions for a 3 billion pound ($5.09 billion) merger, Sky News reported citing sources.

The news service said that if successfully completed, the deal would put the merged group on course for entry into the FTSE-100 index. (http://bit.ly/1pg4g86) Sky said the two groups were likely to come under pressure from Britain's mergers watchdog, to confirm their discussions as soon as Friday, although a deal is far from certain to be finalised and could take until September to be formally announced. Balfour Beatty and Carillion could not be reach immediately.
