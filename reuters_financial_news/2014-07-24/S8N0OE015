DUBLIN, July 24 (Reuters) - Property prices in Dublin rose by 23.9 percent year-on-year in June, data showed on Thursday, as a lack of supply pushed prices in the capital to a fresh high since the late 2006 peak of an ill-fated property boom.

Prices in Dublin were 3.3 percent higher compared with the previous month, while across the country they rose 2.9 percent month-on-month and 10.6 percent on the year, while they are 43 percent below the levels of their peak, the Central Statistics Office said.
