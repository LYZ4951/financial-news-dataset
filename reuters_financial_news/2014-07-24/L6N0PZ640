MILAN, July 24 (Reuters) - Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> has entered exclusive talks with U.S. investment fund Apollo Management Holdings LP for the sale of its two insurance units, the Italian mid-sized lender said in a statement on Thursday.

Carige, one of 15 Italian banks seeking to pass a regulatory health check of lenders across the euro zone, has long been trying to sell its Carige Vita Nuova and Carige Assicurazioni  units to shore up its capital base.
