July 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Phoenix Park CLO Limited notes final ratings, as follows:   EUR236m class A-1: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR47m class A-2: 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR24m class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable  EUR23m class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable EUR24m class D: 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR14m class E: 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable EUR45.25m subordinated notes: not rated  Phoenix Park CLO Limited is an arbitrage cash flow collateralised loan  obligation (CLO). Net proceeds from the notes are being used to purchase a  EUR400m portfolio of European leveraged loans and bonds. The portfolio is  managed by Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Management Europe Limited. The transaction  features a four-year reinvestment period.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Portfolio Credit Quality Fitch assesses the average credit quality of obligors as 'B'/'B-'. The agency  has public ratings or credit opinions on 51 of 53 obligors in the initial  portfolio. The weighted average rating factor (WARF) of the initial portfolio is  33.4.  Above-average Recoveries The portfolio will comprise a minimum of 90% senior secured obligations.  Recovery prospects for these assets are typically more favourable than for  second-lien, unsecured and mezzanine assets. Fitch has assigned Recovery Ratings  to all but two obligations in the initial portfolio. The weighted average  recovery rate (WARR) of the initial portfolio is 72.5%.  Payment Frequency Switch The notes pay quarterly while the portfolio assets can be reset to a semi-annual  basis from quarterly or monthly. The transaction has an interest-smoothing  account, but no liquidity facility. Liquidity stress for the non-deferrable  class A-1 and A-2 notes, stemming from a large proportion of assets potentially  resetting to a semi-annual basis in any one quarterly period, is addressed by  switching the payment frequency on the notes to semi-annual in such a scenario,  subject to certain conditions.  Limited Interest Rate Risk No more than 10% of the portfolio may consist of fixed-rate assets;  consequently, the majority of this risk is naturally hedged, as all notes are  floating-rate. Fitch modelled a 10% fixed-rate bucket in its analysis, which  showed that the rated notes can withstand excess spread compression in a rising  interest rate environment.   Limited FX Risk Any non-euro-denominated assets have to be hedged with perfect asset swaps as of  the settlement date, limiting foreign exchange risk. The transaction is  permitted to invest up to 20% of the portfolio in non-euro-denominated assets.  Participation Agreement The issuer purchased the initial portfolio from Blackstone/GSO Corporate Funding  Limited (BGCF). At closing, the issuer entered into a participation agreement  regarding the initial portfolio assets. Under the participation agreement, BGCF  transferred the economic risk and benefits of the assets to the issuer while  retaining the title of the assets. Immediately after closing, BGCF has begun  transferring the title of the assets to the issuer via assignment. The  assignment process is expected to last several months.  This arrangement differs from other comparable Fitch-rated CLO transactions  since the seller of the initial portfolio is not a bankruptcy-remote warehouse  SPV. BGCF is an operating company whose business activities are not limited to  dealing with the issuer. BGCF has granted the issuer a fixed charge over the  initial portfolio assets while the title is being transferred to the issuer. A  fixed charge over financial assets is generally debatable given the lack of  control. However, Fitch received a strong legal opinion that the fixed charge in  this case is likely to be upheld. Fitch considers that the fixed charge, coupled  with the fairly short risk horizon, adequately mitigate the risk of the assets  becoming trapped in the insolvency estate of BGCF before the title transfer is  completed.   Documentation Amendments The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or noteholder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a rating action  commentary if the change has a negative impact on the ratings. Such amendments  may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis confirms the  expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity.  If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from a rating  perspective Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that the  structure considers the confirmation to be given if Fitch declines to comment.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A 25% increase in the expected obligor default probability or a 25% reduction in  expected recovery rates would lead to a downgrade of up to three notches for the  rated notes.
