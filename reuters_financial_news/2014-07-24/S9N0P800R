SYDNEY, July 24 (Reuters) - Private equity giants TPG Capital Management Ltd <TPG.UL> and Carlyle Group LP <CG.O> will price shares in Australian hospital company Healthscope Ltd [IPO-HSL.AX] at A$2.10 ($1.98) each, the upper end of the target range, a person familiar with the sale told Reuters.

The pricing means the private equity funds would gain A$2.25 billion ($2.12 billion) by selling down their stake in Healthscope Ltd <IPO-HSL.AX> via an initial public offering. The target range for the shares was set at A$1.76 to A$2.29 per share.
