July 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

This announcement corrects the version published on 23 July 2014, which incorrectly stated the currency of the proposed notes.  Fitch Ratings has assigned Findus PIK S.C.A. (holdco) an expected Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of 'CCC(EXP)' and its planned EUR200m PIK notes issue an expected  debt rating of 'CC(EXP)'/'RR6'. The assignment of final ratings is contingent  upon the receipt of the final documents conforming materially to the preliminary  documentation received. Findus PledgeCo S.a.r.l.'s (Findus) 'B-' Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  and Findus BondCo S.A.'s senior secured notes 'B+' rating are unaffected by the  proposed issue. Fitch has not included the planned issue of EUR200m notes in its leverage ratios  due to their equity-like characteristics, mainly the issuer's option to pay  either PIK or cash interest. Fitch expects the interest on the new notes to be  paid-in-kind given Findus's current limited financial flexibility. Given the  neutral impact of the planned notes on Findus's cash flow and senior debt, the  credit metrics of the restricted group are unchanged. The EUR200m will be issued outside of the restricted group and payment of  interest in cash is optional rather than mandatory. The notes have a maturity of  five years and the proceeds will be used to repay part of the issuer's existing  preferred equity certificates (PECs). The PIK notes will represent a senior  obligation of the issuer and will benefit from first-priority pledges over the  share capital of the restricted group (Findus Special Intermediary) and over  Findus PIK SCA's parent's (Findus Intermediary) PECs. There is no cross-default  between the restricted group debt obligations and the PIK notes, but enforcement  of the PIK notes share pledge would lead to a change of control event at the  restricted group level. The holdco's expected IDR of 'CCC(EXP)' is derived from Findus's 'B-' IDR  reflecting its links to the operating performance of the restricted group but  notched down to reflect the holdco's higher default risk. The higher default  risk is largely attributable to the holdco's subordinated nature within the  holding structure and significant limitations (e.g. restricted payments) to  upstream payments from the restricted group. The expected instrument rating on the PIK notes of 'CC(EXP)' reflects the deeply  subordinated nature of these instruments relative to Findus's senior liabilities  as well as the absence of direct claims over the restricted group other than a  residual equity claim on Findus. Fitch believes that under a distressed  scenario, this feature is likely to result in poor recovery ratings of 'RR6' in  the range of 0%-10%.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Geographic and Product Diversity  Findus remains the leader in its key markets of Norway, Sweden, Finland and  France, with high market shares in branded frozen food and a diverse product  proposition of frozen fish and ready-to-eat meals. However, Fitch expects  increasing private-label penetration and competition from chilled food to  continue putting pressure on Findus group's profit margins. Cost savings, while  limited, are expected to remain the key driver of profit growth.  Volatility in Commodity Prices  Sudden commodity price inflation, such as the recent all-time high price of  salmon, in conjunction with greater volatility in food commodity markets will  continue to challenge Findus, especially in the event of a slowdown in consumer  spending. Meanwhile, the group is benefiting from continued investments in  product innovation and successful negotiations of contracts with food retailers  to pass on price increases in raw materials.  Scope for EBITDA Stability  Fitch expects product innovation and contract negotiations to mitigate raw  material price increases. We therefore project that EBITDA margins should remain  fairly stable at FY14's (year to September 2014) 8%. FY13 and 1HFY14  performances were in line with management's expectations despite challenges in  frozen fish sales in Norway. EBITDA margins returned to the FY11 level after  having previously been on a contracting path.  Resilient Food Consumption  Consumption of fast-moving consumer goods is fairly resilient through the  economic cycle, although growth in mature and developed markets is limited.  Findus's product innovation capabilities and targeted marketing spending are key  to ensuring its product offering remains relevant to consumers amid changing  economic conditions, consumer preferences, health concerns and food price  inflation.  Improving FCF  Findus has historically generated low levels of FCF, which is considered a  weakness. Although we expect a mildly negative FCF margin in 2014 due to one-off  costs for refinancing, exchange rate translational differences and working  capital unwinding, we expect cash generation to improve, albeit remaining  relatively weak at around 1% during FY14-FY16.  High Leverage  Findus's FFO adjusted gross leverage at end of the financial year to September  2013 (FYE13) post refinancing remained high at 6.4x. Fitch expects leverage to  improve towards 5.5x with FFO fixed charge cover moving towards 1.8x by 2016. If  maintained, this leverage profile would be considered relatively strong for the  'B-' rating relative to close peers.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating actions include: - Improvement in operating profitability and organic business growth evidenced  by EBITDA margin improvement up to 9% (FYE13: 7.9%) and FCF margin of 3% or  higher (FYE13: 0.2%). - Further de-leveraging with FFO adjusted leverage to or below 5.5x on a  sustained basis (FYE13: 6.4x). - FFO fixed charge cover at 2x or above on a sustained basis (FYE13: 2.3x).  Negative: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive negative rating actions include: - A contraction in organic revenue, for example resulting from increased  competitive pressures, combined with a steady reduction in operating  profitability leading to an EBITDA margin below 7%. - Consecutive periods of negative FCF leading to erosion of the liquidity  cushion. - A sustained deterioration in FFO adjusted leverage to or above 7x. - FFO fixed charge cover sustainably at 1.5x or below.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Adequate Liquidity  Fitch anticipates that Findus's liquidity will remain adequate, supported by a  super senior RCF of GBP60m and, in the longer term, mildly positive FCF  generation from FY15. No Maturities Before 2018
