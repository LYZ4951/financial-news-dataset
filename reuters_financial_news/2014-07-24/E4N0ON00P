BRASILIA, July 24 (Reuters) - Interest rates at current levels should help inflation in Brazil ease back toward the center of the official target, the central bank said in the minutes of its last interest rate setting meeting released on Thursday.

The bank kept its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> on hold at 11 percent for the second straight time last week, but surprised markets by not signaling its next monetary step. [ID:nL2N0PR0TI]
