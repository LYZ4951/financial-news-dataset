COPENHAGEN, July 24 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> posted its best quarterly result since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008, thanks to a one-off item, money saved from cost-cutting programmes and lower write-downs on bad loans.

Both net interest income and net fee income were better than I and others had expected. Net trading income was a bit lower than expected though." "They are doing well on cutting the costs in group. Costs were lower than expected and so were loan impairment charges. So the bank can really reap the benefits of their initiatives in this quarter." "They are taking another step in the process of closing the gap to their large Nordic peers. But they still need to work hard on improving customer satisfaction." "I am sure that Danske Bank will continue to reap the benefits of their on-going initiatives in the coming quarters so that the profitability will rise." "They upgraded their guidance for the full-year as expected and I think we could (see) another upgrade later in the year if the general development continues along the lines we have seen so far this year." "I believe they can reach a 2014 net result of between 11 and 14 billion crowns compared to their new guidance of between 9 and 13 billion crowns."
