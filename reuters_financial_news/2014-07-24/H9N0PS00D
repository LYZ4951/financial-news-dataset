HONG KONG, July 24 (Reuters) - China shares rose sharply on Thursday as investors plowed into blue chips, cheered by the progress of a trading plan that will soon make it much easier for foreigners to buy Shanghai stocks.

Sentiment was further boosted after a preliminary HSBC survey showed that China's factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in 18 months in July as new orders surged.
