FRANKFURT, July 24 (Reuters) - German state-backed lender BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] said on Thursday it agreed to sell its Hungarian unit MKB to the Hungarian government to comply with regulatory demands.

Hungary will pay 55 million euros ($74 million) for MKB and in return BayernLB will waive 270 million euros of receivables due from the unit, BayernLB said in a statement. It expects the deal to close in September. The European Commission ordered BayernLB in 2012 to restructure and sell some businesses as a precondition for approving state aid for the German regional lender. BayernLB ran into trouble in 2008 after risky investments turned sour.The chief executive of Hungary's biggest bank OTP <OTPB.BU> had said in December that the bank was interested in any lender that could come up for sale including MKB.
