HANOI, July 24 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed up 0.76 percent at 602.06 points on Thursday, its highest level since April 8, but a low volume indicated weak buying.

Volume was below the five-day average level, with nearly 88 million shares changing hands, but a fourth of which was penny stocks of property firm FLC Group Co <FLC.HM>, Reuters data showed. Earlier this week FLC was added to the VN30 list, the exchange's best performing shares. "Despite widespread gains in blue chips, slim trade showed that money was not flowing into the market," said deputy manager Nguyen Tuan of An Binh Securities. PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's largest listed firm, led the gainers, rising 0.88 percent, followed by dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> that advanced 0.74 percent.
