LONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - Proposed new European Union sanctions would ban European investors from buying new debt or shares of Russian banks owned 50 percent or more by the state, diplomats said on Thursday.

The largest such banks are Sberbank <SBER.MM>, VTB <VTBR.MM>, Russian Agriculture Bank (Rosselkhozbank) and VEB.  The following are outstanding syndicated loans and short-dated hard-currency bonds issued by these banks and by Russian energy companies Rosneft <ROSN.MM> and Novatek <NVTK.MM> and by Gazprombank <GZPRI.RTS> and VEB, on which the United States imposed sanctions on July 17.
