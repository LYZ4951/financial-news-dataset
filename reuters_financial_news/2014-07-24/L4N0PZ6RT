WELLINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - Auckland International Airport <AIA.NZ> on Friday said it had priced a $250 million loan in the U.S. Private Placement market to refinance a capital return paid to shareholders earlier in the year, along with a bond maturing later this year.

The 12-year loan tranche has a U.S. dollar coupon of 3.61 percent and will be drawn on Nov. 25, the operator of the country's largest airport said.
