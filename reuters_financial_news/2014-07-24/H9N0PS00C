HONG KONG, July 24 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares rose on Thursday, thanks to the strength of mainland stocks as investors plowed into blue chips, cheered by the progress of a trading plan that will soon make it much easier for foreigners to buy Shanghai stocks.

China markets have been rising since mainland media reported on Monday that a Hong Kong and Shanghai cross-border trading programme was expected to launch in October. The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.7 percent at 24,141.50 points, its highest close since April 2011. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was up 1.1 percent to close at its highest since December 2013.
