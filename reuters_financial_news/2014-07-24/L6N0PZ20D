LONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - European shares opened slightly lower on Thursday, with investor attention dominated by a raft of mixed company earnings and economic data that appeared unlikely to dispel worries about the eurozone's pace of recovery.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> slipped 0.2 percent in early trade, to 1,372.80 points, with benchmark indexes in France, Germany and the UK down 0.3 to 0.6 percent. An early batch of second-quarter company results pointed to a mixed performance for European firms: shares of consumer goods group Unilever <UNc.AS> <ULVR.L> were down more than 1.7 percent after a lower-than-expected increase in quarterly sales, while Germany's BASF <BASFn.DE> also fell on earnings disappointment. However, telecoms gear maker Nokia <NOKV.HE> surged 7.4 percent after the profit margins of its core networks came in better than expected, improving the full-year outlook for the firm. Eurozone Markit PMI data was also expected later on Thursday, with initial figures from France showing a fall in manufacturing PMI to a seven-month low of 47.6 even as services PMI rose to a three-month high.
