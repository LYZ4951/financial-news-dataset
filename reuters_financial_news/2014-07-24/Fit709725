July 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Qatar Real Estate  Investment Company P.J.S.C.'s (Alaqaria) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB+', and Short-term IDR at 'F2'. The Outlook  on the Long-term IDR is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Business Model The ratings reflect Alaqaria's strong business model, robust lessor profile and  above-average lease duration for the region. Finance leases provide stable,  long-term rental income, which are underpinned by off-take arrangements with  Qatar Petroleum (QP) and government-related entities (typically 10-15 years'  duration), and operational lease agreements of between five and 25 years with  QP-related companies. However, Alaqaria's size and concentration risks limit the  standalone rating to its current level.   Low Counterparty Risk The ratings also reflect Alaqaria's low counterparty risk, as most of its  projected income is due to come from strong credits, plus the benefits of a  guaranteed rate of return on its contracts with QP or QP-related entities. These  arrangements have provided Alaqaria with sound defensive qualities during the  region's property downturn. Fitch notes that the majority of income is generated  from QP, the government-owned national oil company, which benefits from a  predetermined internal rate of return. The majority of Alaqaria's rental and  lease income in 2013 continued to be from QP, the government, and QP-related  companies.  Relationship With State-Related Entities Under Fitch's parent and subsidiary methodology, Alaqaria's 'BBB+' rating  benefits from a two-notch uplift from its standalone rating of 'BBB-'. This  reflects the company's strategic and operational relationship with state-related  entities as a leading developer of long-term rental housing projects for both  the state and corporate sectors in Qatar. Any change in government-implied  support, or government ownership of Alaqaria could have negative rating  implications.  Improving Financial Profile Alaqaria's capitalisation and leverage metrics have improved considerably in the  past two years, supporting the current rating. We expect Alaqaria to maintain an  EBIT net interest cost cover over 5x in our forecast period and maintain FFO net  leverage around 4x.Fitch notes that as Alaqaira's new projects in the pipeline  materialise there will be a modest increase in leverage. However, the metrics  will still be in line with the ratings.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings could be downgraded if there is a loss of preferential status with  the state or with QP, EBITDA margins are sustainably below 80%, a downturn which  leads to significantly lower net interest cover or a substantial increase in  leverage; or credit deterioration at the sovereign or QP. The ratings could be upgraded if the company received formal support from the  State of Qatar.  LIQUIDITY & DEBT STRUCTURE
