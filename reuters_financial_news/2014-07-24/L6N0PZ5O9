MILAN/LONDON, July 24 (Reuters) - Italy's Fiat <FIA.MI> rebuffed a Financial Times report that said the carmaker had held talks with France's PSA Peugeot-Citroen <PEUP.PA> over a possible merger.

"There are no talks between us and Peugeot," a Fiat spokesman said, while Peugeot declined to comment. Shares in Fiat and Peugeot, which had been up around 3 percent after the report's publication on Thursday, pared gains after Fiat's denial. Traders cited the report as a reason for the earlier gains.
