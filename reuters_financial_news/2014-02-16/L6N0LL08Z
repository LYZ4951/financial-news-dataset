DUBAI, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Zain Bahrain has moved a step closer to launching a long-awaited initial public offer of its shares after the telecommunications operator announced its intention to become a public company in a government newsletter.

Under the terms of its licence, Zain Bahrain - the kingdom's No.1 mobile operator by subscribers and 56.3 percent owned by Kuwait's Zain <ZAIN.KW> - must sell 15 percent of its shares in an IPO and list on the Bahrain bourse.  Zain Bahrain missed a 2013 deadline to do so, but a source last week told Reuters that the company planned to launch its share sale by the end of June in what could be the island's first IPO since 2010. [ID:nL5N0LH3B5] The company's announcement in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's gazette, published on Thursday, said the ministry had received Zain Bahrain's request to become a public company and that any objections should be submitted within 60 days.
