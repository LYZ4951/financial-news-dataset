SYDNEY, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Australian shares will start the week on a firm note tracking gains on Wall Street as the market remained optimistic about growth outlook, with local earnings also underpinning the positive sentiment.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.8 percent to 5,352.0, which was a 4.3-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark climbed 0.9 percent to near six-week highs on Friday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> gained 0.3 percent to 4,901.8 in early trade. * U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with major indexes notching a second straight week of gains as investors were once again willing to overlook some soft economic data stemming from bad weather. * Copper rose on Friday, helped by a weak dollar and limited short-term availability of the metal in the physical market, but gains were limited by uncertainty about the demand outlook following soft U.S. and Chinese economic data. * Top Australian coal hauler Aurizon Holdings Ltd <AZJ.AX> reported an 18 percent rise in first-half underlying profit on Monday spurred by strong coal volumes, and raised its forecast for coal haulage this year.
