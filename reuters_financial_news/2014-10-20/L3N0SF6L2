WELLINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand healthcare software company Orion Health Group Ltd is planning a share offer and regional stock exchange listings to fund product development and marketing, the company said on Tuesday.

An initial public offer would look to raise between NZ$120 million to NZ$150 million ($95.6 million-$119.5 million), Orion said, with a company associated with the chief executive selling up to NZ$5 million worth of shares into the offer. Orion said it expected to release a prospectus and other financial information later this month, and was aiming for a listing on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges in late November. Brokerages Deutsche Craigs and First NZ Capital are the lead managers for the offer.
