TORONTO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Amaya Gaming Group Inc <AYA.TO>, which has pivoted to focus on the fast growing online gambling market, said on Monday it is exploring a sale of its Cadillac Jack subsidiary that makes slot machines for casinos.

Earlier this summer, Montreal-based Amaya closed on the $4.9 billion takeover of Rational Group, operator of online gambling website PokerStars, just as several U.S. states have begun to move on legislation to legalize online gambling. [ID:nL4N0Q44O9]
