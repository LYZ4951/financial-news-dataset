PRAGUE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The board of Czech artificial textile maker Pegas Nonwovens <PGSN.PR> has approved a prospectus for issuing bonds worth up to 2.5 billion crowns ($115.93 million) to pay down bank loans, the company said on Monday.

The final decision on issuing the bonds is subject to market conditions, Pegas said, adding any issuance would not lead to an increase in the firm's net debt.
