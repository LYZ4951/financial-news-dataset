Oct 20 (Reuters) - Vitamin Shoppe Inc <VSI.N>, the nutritional supplement retailer under activist shareholder pressure to consider a sale, is speaking to investment banks about hiring a financial adviser, according to people familiar with the matter.

The scope of a bank's mandate is not yet clear, and Vitamin Shoppe may decide against such a move, the sources said on Monday. However, the talks illustrate the retailer is trying to formulate a response to requests made by some big shareholders. A handful of large shareholders have asked the company to consider a sale to private equity or larger rival GNC Holdings Inc <GNC.N>, Reuters reported last month. At least one unnamed activist fund has accumulated a stake in Vitamin Shoppe and has talked with board members about a potential sale. [ID:nL1N0RJ232]
