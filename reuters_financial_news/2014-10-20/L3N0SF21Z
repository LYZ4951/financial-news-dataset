BANGKOK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks rose on Monday, with Indonesian shares hitting their highest in more than two weeks amid expectations of a cut in fuel subsidy and easing political tensions.

Gains in the region were also supported by brighter sentiment regarding global risk assets. Japanese stocks led a rally in Asia on Monday, after solid U.S. data and earnings calmed tumult in global financial markets and reassured investors worried about the health of the world economy. [MKTS/GLOB] Brokers in the region cited expectations about the U.S. interest rates. [ID:nL2N0SD0OH] "Expectations grew for the U.S. Fed to maintain interest rate at a low level until the second half of 2015 and while the ECB pledged to begin its asset purchase soon, which could lead to a relief rise after a week of sharp correction," Bangkok-based broker KGI Securities said. Among the outperformers, Indonesia's key index <.JKSE> was up 1.02 percent at 5,080.42 after hitting 5,101.21, the highest since Oct. 2. Inflows lifted large caps with Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> and Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> among the top actively traded stocks. Former Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo was sworn in as Indonesia's seventh president at a ceremony in parliament on Monday. One of his first jobs will be cutting back generous fuel subsidies to avoid breaching a legal limit on the budget deficit. [ID:nJ9N0PJ015] [ID:nL3N0SC3EX] The Thai SET index <.SETI> traded up 0.64 percent at 1,538.56. Shares of Kasikornbank <KBANK.BK> jumped more than 3 percent and Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK> rose about 1 percent after both of them reported better-than-expected July-September earnings.
