LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Two senior London-based currency traders at Dutch lender Rabobank <RABN.UL> have left the bank following an internal investigation into the bank's currency trading practices, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.

The two men are Gary Andrews and Chris Twort, who had both been suspended earlier this month. A bank official familiar with the situation said an agreement had been reached under the terms of which the two suspended traders had left the company. No further details of why the men left were available. Andrews was the bank's chief dealer and Twort was a senior trader. Both were listed as "inactive" on the UK financial watchdog's register of approved individuals as of October 8. Reuters reported their suspensions on October 7.
