Oct 20 (Reuters) - Banks should defer bonus payments for 10 years and make employees bear the brunt of legal fines, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday, taking aim at continued lapses across the industry even after the 2007-9 financial crisis.

New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley said banks should move toward paying employees in debt securities for their annual bonus incentives, rather than in equity.
