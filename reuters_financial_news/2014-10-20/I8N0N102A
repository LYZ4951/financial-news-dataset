MUMBAI, Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC [WP.UL] has agreed to buy a significant minority stake in India's Kalyan Jewellers for about $200 million, five sources with knowledge of the transaction told Reuters on Monday.

The  Indian jewellery manufacturer and retailer will use the capital for expansion purposes, said the sources, who declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. "The deal is almost done and we may probably announce it later the day," said one of the sources, who is directly involved in the stake sale. Kalyan and Warburg Pincus did not have immediate comments when asked by Reuters. Sources had told Reuters in March that multiple private equity funds were in separate talks with Kalyan to invest between $200 million and $250 million. [ID:nL3N0IS3BP]
