MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Monday asked the Senate to approve another seven-year term for central bank Deputy Governor Roberto del Cueto, who took up the post in 2007.

Nominated by Peña Nieto's predecessor Felipe Calderón, del Cueto, a former banking regulator and executive at Banamex, could stay in the job through 2021 if cleared by the Senate.
