MILAN, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> lost 2.5 percent on Monday following a report at the weekend that a pan-European banking review drawing to a close this week may unveil a fresh capital shortfall at the bailed-out Italian lender.

Italy's banking stock <.FTIT8300> lost 0.6 percent. Leading Italian daily Corriere della Sera wrote on Saturday that Monte dei Paschi could have additional capital requirements of between 0.5 and 1.7 billion euros, citing "unofficial analyses." The shortfall, if any, is more likely to be in the bottom part of that range, it added.  Monte dei Paschi was not available for a comment.
