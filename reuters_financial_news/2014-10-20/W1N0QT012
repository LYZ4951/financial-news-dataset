Oct 20 (Reuters) - Incentive programs at banks should reward not just bankers who increase revenues, but those who avoid losses and identify risks that could later hurt the institution, a top U.S. Federal Reserve official said on Monday.

Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said that progress has been made regarding proper bank compensation since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, though more needs to be done.  "It is important that compensation arrangements, including clawback and forfeiture provisions, cover risks associated with market conduct and consumer protection, as well as credit and market risks," Tarullo said in prepared remarks at a New York Fed conference on Monday.
