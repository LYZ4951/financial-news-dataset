NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - A Toronto man accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of insider trading related to Herbalife Ltd <HLF.N> on Monday sued the federal regulator agency to stop it from pursuing its case.

In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Jordan Peixoto said the SEC's administrative proceeding against him deprives him of protections he would enjoy in federal court, and violates the U.S. Constitution because of the manner in which administrative law judges are appointed. Peixoto also said he denies all allegations of wrongdoing and is ready to defend against the SEC's allegations.
