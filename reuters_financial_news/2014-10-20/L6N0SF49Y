BUCHAREST, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Romanian investment fund Fondul Proprietatea <FP.BX> plans to buy back 750 million of its shares, or roughly 6 percent at a tender, it said on Monday.

The 3.4 billion euros ($4.35 billion) fund, created to compensate Romanians whose assets were seized under communism, holds minority stakes in a slew of state-owned companies, some of which are unlisted. It has been buying back its shares in a bid to narrow the discount between its net asset value and its share price, which now stands at roughly 26 percent.
