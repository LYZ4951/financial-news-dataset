LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Investor requests to pull money out from hedge funds dropped to a nine-month low in October, new data released on Monday showed.

The SS&C <SSNC.O> GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator, a snapshot of hedge fund clients giving notice to withdraw cash expressed as a percentage of assets under administration, fell to 3.12 percent in October from 3.25 percent in September. "October's forward redemptions decreased slightly from September, but remain in line with historical averages," said Bill Stone, chairman and chief executive of SS&C Technologies.
