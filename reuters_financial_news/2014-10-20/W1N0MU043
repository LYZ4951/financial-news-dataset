LAS VEGAS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The regulator of Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> said on Monday it was developing rules to let Americans buy homes with down payments as low as 3 percent, part of a push to boost access to credit.

Mel Watt, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said the new guidelines for the two taxpayer-owned firms would be "sensible and responsible."  "(They) will be able to responsibly serve a targeted segment of creditworthy borrowers with lower down payment mortgages," he said in a speech.  Watt said the lower down payments would be allowed when taking into account "compensating factors." He did not specify what those factors would be.
