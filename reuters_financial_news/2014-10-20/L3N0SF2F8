SEOUL, Oct 20 (Reuters) - South Korean shares soared on Monday, producing their largest one-day percentage gain in 11 months as better-than-expected U.S economic data sparked a relief rally in equity markets worldwide.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> climbed 1.55 percent to close at 1,930.06 points. It was the biggest one-day rise since Nov. 15, 2013. The South Korean won <KRW=> firmed on Monday, supported by demand for the local currency as offshore players bought back oversold stocks. Foreign investors bought a net 26.2 billion won ($24.73 million) of shares on the main bourse on Monday, snapping a 12-day selling streak where they repatriated a net 2.4 trillion won ($2.27 billion) worth.
