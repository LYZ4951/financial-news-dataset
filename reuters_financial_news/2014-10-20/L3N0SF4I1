COLOMBO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks fell for the third session on Monday in moderate volume, led by profit-taking in blue-chips as investors awaited cues from the 2015 budget and the September quarter earnings amid speculations over an early election.

Sri Lanka's main stock index <.CSE> fell 0.29 percent, or 21.02 points, to 7,213.45, its lowest since Oct. 14. "It's profit-taking, but uncertainty is also weighing on the market," a stockbroker said on condition of anonymity.  The day's turnover was 863.1 million rupees ($6.6 million), less than this year's daily average of over 1.36 billion rupees. Foreign investors bought a net 8.4 million rupees worth of shares on Monday, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 10.14 billion rupees, exchange data showed. Blue chips such as John Keells Holdings <JKH.CM> fell 0.32 percent to 247.20 rupees, while large-cap illiquid Nestle Lanka <NEST.CM> ended 0.94 percent down to 2,080.20 rupees.  Traders said the market was waiting to see the performance in the September quarter earnings before a decision to buy the island nation's risky assets.   Stockbrokers said trading in local shares may be volatile  due to chances of an early presidential poll and a possible bottoming out of interest rates. The government is also scheduled to present its 2015 budget on Friday.
