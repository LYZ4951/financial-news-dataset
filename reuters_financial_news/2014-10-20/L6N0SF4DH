MADRID, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Spanish fast-food company Telepizza said on Monday private equity firm KKR <KKR.N> and other investment funds had acquired a 49 percent stake in the group as part of a refinancing plan that cuts its debt in half.

In a statement, Telepizza said the refinancing would allow it to re-launch its brand, continue remodelling its shops and support its international expansion plans.  Following the refinancing, the company will have 285 million euros ($364 million) of debt and a 10 million euro revolving credit line. Its other shareholders are private equity house Permira [PERM.UL] and investment vehicle Carbal with 51 percent.
