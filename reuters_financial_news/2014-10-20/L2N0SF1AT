Oct 20 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc <AGN.N> shareholder Paulson & Co is urging the Botox maker to merge with specialty pharmaceutical company Shire Plc <SHP.L> as a potential alternative to a deal with hostile bidder Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.TO>, according to two people familiar with the matter.     The hedge fund, which is Allergan's third largest shareholder, told Allergan CEO David Pyott that it would support a deal with Shire, the sources said. The deal would not be structured as a so-called tax inversion, the people said. It could not be learned whether Allergan would pursue such a deal.

Paulson's move comes as AbbVie's <ABBV.N> $54 billion deal to buy Shire is close to unraveling after the U.S. government changed the rules governing tax inversions. Allergan and Paulson declined to comment.
