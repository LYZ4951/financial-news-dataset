Oct 20 (Reuters) - EBay Inc <EBAY.O> said venture capitalist Marc Andreessen would quit its board, after the online retailer announced last month that it was spinning off its electronic payment unit, PayPal.

Andreessen, who has been on the company's board for six years, said "now is the right time to step down," eBay said in a statement on Monday. [ID:nBw9hPnmNa]
