LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The results of a landmark review of Europe's banks are likely to be published later than the Oct. 17 date originally targeted by officials but will still be before the formal deadline of end-October, sources told Reuters.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is carrying out a wide ranging review of the way 130 of the euro zone's largest banks value their assets. Those banks will also do EU-wide tests on whether they have enough capital to weather future crises.  The ECB had informally pencilled in Friday Oct. 17 as the  results date for the combined exercise and had told some banks. Sources told Reuters that date was now very unlikely to be met.  The most likely alternative dates are Friday Oct. 24 and Friday Oct. 31. A decision on which one has not yet been taken, a personal familiar with the matter said.
