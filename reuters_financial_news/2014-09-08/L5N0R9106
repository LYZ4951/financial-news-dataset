LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Investors are expected to pump $49 billion into funds that mimic hedge fund tactics over the next year, to make so called "liquid alternatives" the fastest growing part of the asset management industry, a survey said.

That would mark a 44 percent jump in the amount of money brought in by these funds in the last year, according to a new survey released on Monday by Deutsche Bank of 86 hedge fund managers and investors overseeing $6.8 trillion in assets.
