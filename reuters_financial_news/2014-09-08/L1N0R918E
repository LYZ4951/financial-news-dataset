NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> Chief Executive Officer Ray Conner said on Monday he sees "incredible pressure" to increase the production rate of the 737 jetliner beyond current targets, a further signal the company is poised to announce further rate increases beyond its current targets.

"There's incredible pressure to go higher" in rate, Conner said at a press conference in New York to announce an $11 billion sale of 737 MAX planes to Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc <RYA.I>, starting in 2019. "We still see tremendous demand across the board, way beyond 47 a month," Conner said, referring to Boeing's target to produce 47 737s a month, starting in 2017.  Boeing currently produces 42 737s a month at its factory in Renton, Washington, using fuselage sections produced by Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc <SPR.N> in Wichita, Kansas.
