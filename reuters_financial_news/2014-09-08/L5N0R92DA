LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Russia's decision to restrict food imports from a range of countrie will hurt growth in the Baltic states, Poland and Norway, with Lithuania being hardest hit, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Monday.

Russia last month imposed food import bans on a series of food items from the European Union and the United States, in retaliation for Western sanctions, saddling food producers in several countries with huge losses. The EBRD said the overall effect of the food bans would be temporary but added: "It may have a noticeable effect on exports and gross domestic product (GDP) in the three Baltic states, Norway, Poland and Hungary, as their food exports to Russia make a substantial contribution to their GDP." It noted that Lithuania whose food exports to Russia make up 2.7 percent of GDP would likely be most affected.  Russia too is seen suffering from the ban, with the EBRD  warning of a possible 2 percentage-point rise in consumer inflation from the 7.5 percent recorded in July. "The effect of sanctions on Russian GDP is likely to be negative overall. Some initial positive GDP effect may come from increased domestic food production in the short term," the EBRD added.
