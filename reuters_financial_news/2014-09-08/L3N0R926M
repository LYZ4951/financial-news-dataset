BANGKOK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Monday, with Indonesian stocks marking a record close for a second time in the month amid expectations of a likely end to fuel subsidy. Stocks in the Philippines hit the highest in more than 15 months.

The market brought in foreign inflows for a fourth straight session on Monday amid talks of a fuel price hike.
