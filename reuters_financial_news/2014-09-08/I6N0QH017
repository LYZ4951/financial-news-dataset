MILAN, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The Bank of Italy said on Monday it would broaden the range of assets Italian banks can use as collateral to borrow from the European Central Bank, a move aimed at channeling more funds to small companies and families.

The central bank, confirming a Reuters report published in May, said that lenders could from Sept. 10 use certain banking current account facilities as collateral in ECB's funding operations.[ID:nL6N0NZ1HC]
