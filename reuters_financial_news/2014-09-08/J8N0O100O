NAIROBI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Kenya's central bank said on Monday it was seeking to mop up 8 billion shillings ($90.3 million) of excess liquidity.

The central bank has regularly soaked up excess liquidity from the money market since last year, lending support to the shilling <KES=> by making it more expensive for banks to hold long dollar positions.
