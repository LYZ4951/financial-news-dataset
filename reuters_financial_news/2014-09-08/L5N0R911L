DUBAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank [ISDBA.UL] has picked nine banks for a potential U.S. dollar-denominated Islamic bond issue, a document from the lead managers showed on Monday.

The AAA-rated IDB has mandated CIMB, Deutsche Bank, First Gulf Bank, GIB Capital, HSBC, Maybank, Natixis, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, and Standard Chartered Bank as joint bookrunners to arrange investor meetings in the Middle East, Europe and  Asia starting on Thursday, it showed. The IDB, which last issued $1 billion in five-year Islamic bonds in July, is looking to increase its issuance of sukuk, partly to raise its profile among international investors and to secure similar pricing levels to other development banks.
