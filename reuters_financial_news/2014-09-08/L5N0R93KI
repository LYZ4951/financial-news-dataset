LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Leveraged loan investors are facing the loss of their single biggest holding as US retailer Walgreen <WAG.N> gets ready to buy the remaining stake in UK pharmacist Alliance Boots [ABN.UL], triggering a massive repayment that will flood the market with cash in the first quarter of 2015.

The 9 billion pound (14.56 billion US dollar) loan that backed KKR's 11 billion pound buyout of Boots was raised in 2008 and is still Europe's biggest LBO ever.  It will leave a sizeable hole in portfolios - nine of the 46 CLO funds that are invested hold more than 50 million euros (64.74 million US dollar) and four have exposure of more than 100 million euros, according to Thomson Reuters data.  "A lot of banks and funds have large exposure to Alliance Boots. These are not just 40 million pound and 50 million pound positions, but go into hundreds of millions," a leveraged loan investor said.  Some of Alliance Boots' loan has already been repaid, including a 750 million pound mezzanine tranche in July 2013, after the company extended 5.1 billion pounds of its then 8.2 billion pound loan in December 2012.  The 5 billion pound-plus forthcoming repayment shows that fears that the deal was too big to refinance or sell have proved to be unfounded.  "The perceived biggest barrier to the ongoing existence and growth of the leveraged loan market doesn't exist any more," a leveraged loan banker said.   BIG DEAL  The repayment will affect the buyside, as investors seek to invest the cash in new deals, and the sellside, as arranging banks try to create new deals to soak up the excess liquidity.  Newer CLOs and bank investors will be seeking to invest the money in new deals to earn a return. But managers of older CLOs past their reinvestment phase will receive reduced management fees as some of the cash is returned to investors.  "Boots means that an awful lot of capital will come into the market in the first quarter. If I was looking to do a successful syndication, I would try to coincide with that capital return," the investor said.  Some CLO managers may try to sell their paper at a slight discount to par before the expected repayment prompts a rush to reinvest after the market is flooded with cash.  This could hit Alliance Boots' secondary price. Finding new buyers for the paper could be difficult, however, as most banks and funds already own the deal and are unwilling to add to already large positions.  Selling Boots could also move the wider secondary market in the first quarter, as cash-fuelled buyers drive prices higher. This could potentially be offset by more primary issuance, but it would take a large number of deals to soak up the cash.
