MUMBAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The changes in the rules for raising Basel III-compliant capital announced by India's central bank this month are "credit positive" as they make it easier for banks to raise funds and attract more investors, Moody's said on Monday.

The Reserve Bank of India on Sept. 1 cut the minimum maturity for Tier 2 capital that banks can issue to five years from 10 years. It also allowed retail investors to buy Tier 1 capital.
