LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - French rail equipment maker Delachaux is looking to raise a 765 million euro (990.22 million US dollar) leveraged loan to refinance existing debt and pay a dividend to shareholders, banking sources said on Monday.

CVC Capital Partners, together with the founding family, took Delachaux private in 2011, backed with 565 million euros in loans. It raised a further 50 million euros in 2012 to finance an acquisition, according to Thomson Reuters LPC.  It has now decided to conduct a dividend recapitalisation, a process whereby debt is refinanced and increased in order to facilitate a dividend payment. Deutsche Bank is leading the deal alongside bookrunners Credit Agricole, HSBC and Natixis, the banking sources said.  The financing includes a 690 million euro, seven-year covenant-lite term loan B, denominated in euros, US dollars, sterling and Australian dollars, the bankers said.   There is also a 75 million euro, 6.5 year revolving credit facility guided to pay 375 basis points over Euribor, offered with a commitment fee of 35 percent of the margin, they added. More details will emerge at a bank meeting which is due to take place on September 10 in London to show the deal to investors. Commitments from lenders are due September 22.
