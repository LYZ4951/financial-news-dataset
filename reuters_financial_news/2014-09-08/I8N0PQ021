MUMBAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose more than 1 percent on Monday, resuming their record-setting streak after two days of consolidations, as strong foreign buying and weak oil prices stoked buying in blue-chips such as HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS>.

The broader NSE index <.NSEI> gained as much as 1.15 percent to a new high of 8,180.20, while the benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose 1.2 percent to an all-time high of 27,354.99, surpassing their previous records hit on Wednesday. HDFC Bank provisionally rose 1.9 percent, while Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> ended higher 1 percent.
