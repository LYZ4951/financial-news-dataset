VIENNA, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International AG <RBIV.VI> is repaying the remaining 750 million euros ($970.7 million) in non-voting participation capital in raised from private investors to help weather the financial crisis, the Austrian lender said.

RBI, which in June repaid 1.75 billion euros in such capital it got from the state, plans to redeem on Sept. 10 the rest it got from private investors, it said in a statement on Monday.
