LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - British stockbroker and investment manager Charles Stanley <CAY.L> on Monday issued its second profit warning in five months, saying increased costs and a low volume of transactions had impacted margins.

"Whilst management have taken actions to reduce the cost base and boost income the board now expects that, barring a significant improvement in the markets, trading results will be materially below current market expectations," it said.
