LAGOS, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Investment Corp of Dubai (ICD), the state fund which holds stakes in some of the emirate's top firms, has agreed to buy a $300 million stake in top Nigerian cement producer Dangote Cement <DANGCEM.LG>, a spokesman for Dangote said on Monday.

Carl Franklin, Dangote's head of investor relations, did not give further details. Dangote's current market capitalisation is about $23.7 billion, meaning ICD is taking a stake of about 1.3 percent.
