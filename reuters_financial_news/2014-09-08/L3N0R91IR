MUMBAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose more than 1 percent on Monday, resuming their record-setting streak after two days of consolidations, as strong foreign buying and weak oil prices stoked buying in blue-chips such as HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS>.

The broader NSE index <.NSEI> gained as much as 1.15 percent to a new high of 8,180.20, while the benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose 1.21 percent to an all-time high of 27,354.99, surpassing their previous records hit on Wednesday. Weak global economic growth combined with ample supply  pushed oil prices below $100 a barrel for the first time in 14 months on Monday. Investors say this will further help the Indian government and the central bank to rein in fiscal deficit and inflation. [O/R] Meanwhile, local shares have benefited from strong foreign buying which has led indexes to a string of record highs this year. The 50-share NSE index is the best performing equity index in Asia, up 32.6 percent in U.S. dollar terms for 2014 so far. Foreign buying is expected to continue after data on Friday showed U.S. employers added the fewest jobs in eight months in August, reviving bets that the Federal Reserve might leave interest rates near zero for longer than anticipated. "Softening of non-food commodity prices would be the next big trigger for Indian shares. Over the next three years earnings will grow by 16-18 percent and market returns would mirror that," said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer - equity at Kotak Mutual Fund. The BSE index rose 1.08 percent, or 293.15 points, to end at 27,319.85. The NSE index rose 1.08 percent, or 87.05 points, to end at 8,173.90, closing above the psychologically important 8,100 level. Goldman Sachs raised its NSE index target to 9,000 points for September 2015 from 8,600 points for June 2015, saying earnings sentiment remained positive for the overall market.

HDFC Bank rose 1.9 percent, while Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> ended up 1.2 percent after falling 0.54 percent over the last two sessions.  Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> rose 1.04 percent, while ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> ended 1.3 percent higher. Oil and Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS> gained 2.6 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to "buy" from "neutral", saying it expected more gains from oil reforms than earlier.
