Sept 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is preparing new rules to boost oversight of mutual funds and hedge funds as part of an effort to gain insight into whether the asset management industry poses risks to the financial system, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.

The SEC is in the early stages of developing rules that would require asset managers such as Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc <BLK.N> to give regulators more information about their portfolios and conduct stress tests on their funds to determine how they would weather economic shocks, the WSJ said. (http://on.wsj.com/1q54tAx) Among the SEC's concerns is some mutual funds' use of derivatives to boost returns, the Wall Street Journal said. The SEC was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
