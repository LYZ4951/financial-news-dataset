MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> said on Wednesday it had won approval from the Bank of Italy to partially repay state loans it received in a bailout.

The bank had to request 4.07 billion euros in state aid last year after being hit hard by the euro zone debt crisis and a scandal over loss-making derivative trades.
