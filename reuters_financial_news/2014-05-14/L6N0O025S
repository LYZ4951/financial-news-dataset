OSLO, May 14 (Reuters) - Norwegian insurance company Gjensidige <GJFS.OL> reported first quarter results in line with forecasts, although its combined ratio was weaker than analyst had expected.[ID:nWEB00N5W]

The following are comments from the firm's chief executive Helge Leiro Baastad to Reuters after the presentation:  ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NORDICS "We are considering profitable opportunities in the Nordic region in general and in the Baltics. We are continuously looking at potential companies, portfolios or distribution models that could be interesting in our field. "We are primarily looking in countries outside Norway, because the market in Norway is already quite structured, so we focus on other Nordic countries and the Baltics. "I am just as optimistic towards finding opportunities now as I was a year ago. "We have done two smaller transactions in the past year, and we will now look for somewhat larger transactions, or at deals with larger distribution potential, because there is a lot of work and costs related to the transactions no matter how large the acquisitions are."  ON COMBINED RATIO "The reason why combined ratio is somewhat weaker than expected, is that we had more large losses this quarter, there were for example more large fires, but the underlying trend in frequency was good. "We say that large losses normally should be around 5.4 percent of the combined ratio, and this quarter it was 5.9, but it is significantly higher than it has been for a while. In the first quarter of 2013 it was 3.3 percent.
