FRANKFURT, May 14 (Reuters) - German insurer Allianz <ALVG.DE> saw 21.7 billion euros in net investment outflows from its bond fund manager Pimco in the first quarter, hurting performance fees and contributing to a 28 percent decline in asset management operating profit.

Quarterly operating profit in asset management fell to 646 million euros from 900 million a year earlier, Europe's largest insurer said on Wednesday.
