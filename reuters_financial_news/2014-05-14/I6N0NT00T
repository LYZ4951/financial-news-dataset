MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Italy started collecting orders on Wednesday for a new 15-year bond it is planning to issue through a syndicate of banks, an official at one of the banks managing the deal said.

Initial indications of interest from investors are for around 7 billion euros ($9.6 billion), the official said. Based on initial price guidance, the new bond maturing in March 2030 would offer a premium of 12-14 basis points over the yield of Italy's September 2028 bond. The pricing of the issue is expected later on Wednesday.
