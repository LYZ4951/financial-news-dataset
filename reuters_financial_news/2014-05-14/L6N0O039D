STOCKHOLM, May 14 (Reuters) - Sweden's Left Party wants to be part of a centre-left government after an election in September, but only if a new administration bans for-profit companies in healthcare and education, leader Jonas Sjostedt said this week.

Most polls show support for the Left Party at around 8 percent against the 5.6 percent it got in 2010 with the centre-left bloc, including the Social Democrats and Green Party, backed by more than 50 percent of voters. [ID:nL6N0NO193] "We have taken a stand on a question which is completely decisive for our participation in government and that is that we get a solution we are satisfied with when it comes to removing profit in welfare provision," Sjostedt told Reuters in an interview. "The areas we are focusing on are schools and pre-school, it's hospitals and hospital care, it is care for the aged, home help, elderly homes." Its stance could prove problematic for the centre-left if it wins the upcoming election as Sjostedt said that his party  would not automatically back the Social Democrats and the Greens from outside government. The current Alliance government has ruled in a minority since 2010, but a centre-left minority government of the Social Democrats and Greens would be much weaker, as the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats regularly vote with the centre-right. "We are not going to be a supporting party and we are not going to make the kind of arrangement we had before 2006, when we made agreements on the budget and such in advance," Sjostedt said. "We will make isolated agreements in cases where we can clearly move policy in the direction we want." The Social Democrats, the largest opposition party and polling around 33 percent, want to limit, not ban, profit in welfare.   TAX HIKES A series of scandals at homes for the elderly and the bankruptcy of school firm JB Education have led many Swedes to rethink eight years of tax cuts, privatisation and welfare reform under the Alliance government. Sjostedt said the Left Party aimed to roll back many of the measures and raise taxes. "We want taxes based on the ability to pay," he said. "We don't want a low tax society." The overall tax burden in Sweden has fallen to around 44.4 percent of GDP from 48.3 percent when the Alliance took power, but both the centre-left and the centre-right have said taxes will rise in the coming years to pay for more investment in education and to bring government finances back into the black. Sjostedt said banks should face higher taxes, individuals should be forced to pay down mortgage debt and mortgage tax relief should be reduced in the future. "We think it is reasonable to start to discuss whether it is time to start reducing mortgage tax relief," he said. "But I want to underline that there won't be any drastic measures which would put many people in an untenable economic situation." Sjostedt said the Left Party wanted bank operations to be split up, separating retail and corporate lending from higher risk investment banking.
