TORONTO, May 14 (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia <BNS.TO> said on Wednesday it will explore options to divest itself of some or all of its 37 percent stake in asset manager CI Financial <CIX.TO> "over time."

Canada's No. 3 bank, which acquired the CI stake from insurer Sun Life Financial Inc <SLF.TO> in 2008, said in a statement it would pursue partial or full monetization of the investment "in one, or a series of transactions." Scotiabank, which estimated the market value of the CI stake at C$3.8 billion ($3.48 billion), said there were no assurances that any transaction will be completed.
