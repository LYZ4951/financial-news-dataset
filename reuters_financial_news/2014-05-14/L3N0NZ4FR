TOKYO, May 14 (Reuters) - Sparx Group, one of Japan's top listed asset managers, hopes to increase its asset size by 30 percent to 1 trillion yen ($9.8 billion) by the end of March 2015 as global investors show renewed interest in Japanese equities, the head of the company said.

Shuhei Abe, president and chief executive of Sparx, told Reuters in an interview that one of Asia's biggest home-grown hedge funds is looking for investments from cash-rich retail investors, who hold $16 trillion in household assets. Sparx held 689.4 billion yen in assets under management as of April and Abe said the company may launch a new mutual fund during the current financial year. "We have set two major goals this year. The first one is to continue increasing our profitability and another is to increase our assets back to 1 trillion yen this fiscal year," Abe said. Sparx aims to boost assets under management above 1 trillion yen for the first time since September 2008 by offering domestic equity strategies including long/short, middle and small capitalisation and clean technology. Sparx also wants to focus on increasing assets of its new business engagement fund called the "Value Impact Fund" to 20-30 billion yen by December. The fund was launched in March with initial capital of 1.5 billion yen. Abe said engagement funds, which encourage dialogues between investors and companies, are becoming popular around the world. The administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is also introducing a stewardship code to encourage investors to engage more with companies they own to improve profitability and corporate governance. "We can finally play our game and focus on Japanese equities, the area that we are really good at," Abe said. Sparx has struggled in recent years because of a slump in Japanese equities, which forced the company to shift its focus to themed funds, such as renewable energy and property. The company had to rely on its South Korean unit, Cosmo Investment Management, to keep up with its asset size by offering a series of Korean equity and mutual funds. Sparx also had to reduce fixed costs to 2.7 billion yen from a peak of 10 billion in 2009 by sharply cutting staff and moving the head office to a cheaper location, Abe said. But the business environment started to recovery from last year, thanks to the government's aggressive monetary and reflationary policies which lifted domestic shares and pushed down the yen. The company's assets in Japanese equities, which accounts 52 percent of overall assets, jumped 14 percent from a year earlier, while assets in its Korean equity portfolio, which accounts for 46 percent, grew a 0.9 percent.
