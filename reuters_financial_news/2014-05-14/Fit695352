May 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its criteria for the analysis  of counterparty risks in structured finance (SF) transactions and covered bond  (CVB) programmes. The criteria are largely unchanged from the previous report  and no rating changes are expected to result from the update. The agency has  maintained its expectations for the timing of remedial actions. The criteria for  the collateralisation of derivative counterparty obligations has been expanded  to include certain sovereign bonds rated at least 'A' and 'F1'. In order to delink SF and CVB ratings from the risk of the counterparty, Fitch  expects counterparties to be obligated to implement remedial actions on a timely  basis upon becoming ineligible. Specifically where collateralisation is a  feasible mitigant then action is expected within 14 calendar days, or for other  remedial actions within 30 calendar days. The 30 calendar day remedial timing  has been a feature of Fitch's counterparty criteria since 2004.  In the past year, Fitch has observed an increased number of structural proposals  seeking to accommodate longer remedial periods (e.g. 31 calendar days or 30  working days). Fitch believes that such structural proposals are motivated  primarily by the advent of the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) that  will require counterparties to hold liquid assets to cover for certain potential  outflows (including those in relation to remedial actions) that may occur within  30 calendar days of a three-notch downgrade.  One line of argument presented by counterparties in support of extended remedial  timing is that actual remedial actions often take longer than 30 calendar days.  Fitch acknowledges that remedial actions may take longer to implement in  practice, depending on factors including the amount of upfront preparation  completed by the counterparty and the volume of counterparty replacement  activity being undertaken at a particular point in time. However, Fitch does not  consider it appropriate to amend its criteria expectations such that  counterparty remedial obligations are placed beyond the 30 calendar day scope of  the LCR.  Further, Fitch is of the opinion that the provisions of the LCR reinforce a key  assumption of the counterparty criteria. Namely, that upon becoming ineligible,  counterparties will have the financial ability to take remedial action. Where  structural proposals are not consistent with Fitch's expectations the agency  will continue to analyse these in accordance with the "Non-Compliance with  Criteria" section of the criteria report. In this criteria update, Fitch has expanded the range of eligible collateral for  derivative counterparty obligations to include eurozone and Japanese sovereign  bonds with a minimum rating of 'A' and 'F1'. Previously sovereign bonds were  expected to have a minimum rating of 'AA-' and 'F1+'. The 'A' and 'F1' rating  threshold is consistent with that applied to other counterparty exposures while  the market value risk of sovereign bonds is addressed via the application of  advance rates specified in the derivative addendum. Advance rates for 'AA-' and  'F1+' sovereign bonds have been updated with minor changes to reflect updated  market data.  Other than the above change, there are no other material changes and the  criteria update is not expected to impact any structured finance or covered bond  ratings.
