MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Popolare di Sondrio <BPSI.MI> said on Wednesday net profit for the first quarter had nearly quadrupled to 42 million euros ($57.6 million) from 11 million last year, helped by higher interest income, commission and fees.

The mid-tier bank is one of 15 under review by the European Central Bank in a check up of lenders across the euro zone this year.
