MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Net profit at Italy's fifth-biggest bank, UBI <UBI.MI>, more than doubled in the first quarter thanks to rising operating revenues and its stock of bad loans, a sore point for lenders in the euro zone's third biggest economy, edged down slightly.

UBI, one of 15 Italian banks under scrutiny in a Europe-wide health check of lenders, said its net profit came in at 58.1 million euros ($79.6 million), better than a 53 million euros analyst consensus forecast distributed by the bank and up from 26.5 million euros a year ago. Operating revenues rose 6.7 percent, with net interest income - a measure of how much money a bank makes from its core retail business - up 8.9 percent and income from trading increasing 33 percent.  Writedowns on impaired loans were up 26 percent to 198.6 million euros from a year earlier, but the backlog of bad debts inched down 15 million euros lower compared with end-2013 to 12.65 billion euros. UniCredit is the only other top Italian bank to have reported a fall in first-quarter soured loans so far, although it also booked sharply lower loan writedowns after a massive clean-up of its balance sheet in 2013.
