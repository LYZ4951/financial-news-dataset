FRANKFURT, May 14 (Reuters) - Allianz <ALVG.DE> has taken a $30 million hit, or about 9 percent of the insured market loss, on the Malaysia Airlines <MASM.KL> plane that disappeared in March, the German insurer said on Wednesday.

The insured market loss on the plane is around $350 million, which is higher than initially expected because the costs for searching for the plane have to be added to the loss itself, Allianz Chief Financial Officer Dieter Wemmer told a conference call with journalists on Wednesday. Allianz is the lead insurer covering the jet.
