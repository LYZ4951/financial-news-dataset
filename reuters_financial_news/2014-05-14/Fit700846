May 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Three main themes have emerged from the recent spate of  major pharmaceutical M&A, Fitch Ratings says. These are the quest for scale in  consumer healthcare, the need to manage increasing research and development  risks and the role of tax optimisation, which can be used to support high asset  price tags. All three themes were reflected in the recent deal between Bayer <BAYGn.DE> and Merck <MRK.N>, which will create the No. 2 global player in consumer health. This increased  scale can improve operating efficiency through leverage in areas such as supply  chain logistics. The Bayer/Merck deal may have been in part a reaction to  increased competitive pressure from the asset swap between Novartis <NOVN.VX> and  GlaxoSmithKline <GSK.L>, which combined their consumer healthcare arms creating the new  global leader. An associated cardio-vascular strategic collaboration between Bayer and Merck  will also enable joint product development with a view to lowering the risks  involved with bringing products to market. As the cost of developing new drugs  continues to increase as a result of continuing focus on value-based  assessments, R&D productivity will become increasingly important across the  sector. An alternative approach to collaboration will be for companies to narrow the  scope of their research on a smaller number of therapeutic areas. This is  effectively what happened in the GSK/Novartis deal as Novartis acquired oncology  assets, where it is already strong, while handing over its vaccines business to  GSK, which is a leader in that field. In some cases reduced diversification  could be credit negative, but in the case of GSK and Novartis diversification  will remain satisfactory for the current rating. The potential acquisition of Astra Zeneca <AZN.L> by Pfizer <PFE.N> would buck this trend  towards a targeted R&D consolidation by significantly deepening Pfizer's R&D  focus, and it is likely to be followed by a reassessment of the combined group's  core business and the potential divestment of operations that were seen as  non-core. A deal would be more predicated on the tax benefits for Pfizer and is  part of a broader trend of US companies using overseas acquisitions to apply  their significant cash reserves held overseas and shift their domicile to a  lower-tax country. This tax benefit is creating political unease in the US and adds to political  concerns in the UK around intellectual property and jobs given Pfizer's  aggressive focus on costs in past deals. This makes it difficult to predict a  possible outcome, even if the potential for direct political intervention is  limited.
