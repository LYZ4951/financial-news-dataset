SAO PAULO, May 14 (Reuters) - BTG Pactual Asset Management SA, Brazil's fifth-biggest money manager, is cherry-picking stocks and bonds of well-managed companies as a way to reassure shaky investors and curb rising borrowing costs in Latin America's biggest economy, two senior executives said in an interview.

Clients at BTG Pactual Asset, including wealthy individuals and institutional investors, are looking to diversify instead of limiting exposure in Brazil, chief strategist João Scandiuzzi said. In recent months, inflows into domestic bond and stock markets resumed strongly following a period of poor performance. An active approach to investing, which means staying in touch with management at some of the companies in the portfolio, is helping the firm ensure healthy returns over two or more years, he noted. Exposure to top-tier corporate debt, coupled with BTG Pactual's deep knowledge of several sectors, is also helping boost returns and the allure of some funds. "There is appetite among institutional investors for corporate credit and Brazilian stocks in which the ability of the fund manager to cherry-pick prevails," Scandiuzzi said. "In addition, investing in funds with assets overseas helps some investors diversify their holdings and attain above-market returns." The strategy helped BTG Pactual Asset, which handles 189 billion reais ($86 billion) in assets, mostly beat benchmark gauges such as the interbank lending rates CDI, which returned 3.1 percent through April, and the Bovespa stock index <.BVSP>, which returned 3.23 percent through the end of April. According to Morningstar Inc, BTG Pactual Asset's three flagship funds had the following returns after fees through April: 7.77 percent for BTG Pactual Global, 3.15 percent for BTG Pactual Absoluto and 3.52 percent for BTG Pactual Crédito Corporativo. The Bovespa is up 4.9 percent this year in spite of a jump in the benchmark Selic overnight lending rate to 11 percent - the highest level in almost 2 1/2 years. Many analysts expected domestic stocks to fall sharply this year amid slowing growth, possible noise from an October presidential election and ebbing confidence. Scandiuzzi declined to elaborate on sectors or companies in which BTG Pactual Asset is buying or selling. According to central bank data, investors poured a net $12.2 billion into Brazil's local debt markets in the first quarter, the largest inflow for the asset class on record. That came amid higher yields for inflation-linked notes, now paying over 6.3 percentage points above the inflation rate for notes due in 2019, compared with 6.1 percent in January.  An effort by Brazil's securities industry watchdog CVM to standardize funds and make them more market-friendly will be good for asset managers, said Isabella Rebello, a business manager at the firm. The changes could enable managers to create new products for clients.  BTG Pactual Asset needs to analyze the changes before moving to structure new products, she added.
