May 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed OAO LUKOIL's <LKOH.MM> Long-term  foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'BBB'. The Outlook is  Negative and remains constrained by the Outlook on Russia's sovereign ratings  (BBB/Negative) due to the company's asset concentration in Russia and the  influence the Russian state exercises on the oil and gas sector through taxes  and regulation. A full list of ratings actions is at the end of this release. LUKOIL has a strong business profile, in both upstream and downstream, and solid  credit metrics. We believe LUKOIL has sufficient headroom at the current rating  to finance its ambitious development programme and increase its dividend payout.  The company's efforts to stabilise its crude production in Russia as well as its  international expansion, mainly in Iraq, are also beneficial for the business  profile. OAO LUKOIL is the second-largest oil major operating in Russia, with  total hydrocarbon production of 2.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  (mmboe/d) in 2013 (excluding equity affiliates).  KEY RATING FACTORS Russian Oil Major LUKOIL is Russia's largest private oil company, accounting for 16% of crude  production and 17% of oil refining in the country. Its scale of operations is  comparable with those of international majors, such as Royal Dutch Shell plc <RDSa.L> (AA/Stable), BP plc <BP.L> (A/Stable) and ConocoPhillips <COP.N> (A/Stable). In 2013 LUKOIL's  hydrocarbon production amounted to 2.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  (mmboe/d), mainly liquids, which Fitch calculates generated USD18.6bn of EBITDA.   Sovereign-Capped Ratings We cap LUKOIL's ratings at those of the Russian Federation. This reflects the  influence that the sovereign exerts on Russian oil and gas (O&G) companies'  operations and profitability through regulation and taxation. We view LUKOIL's  uncapped ratings in the low 'A' category, limited by country-specific corporate  governance concerns and its oil production concentration in Russia. Fitch revised the Outlook on Russia to Negative from Stable in March 2014. The  revision reflected the potential impact of sanctions on Russia's economy and  business environment. We do not expect that the sanctions will directly affect  LUKOIL, but the perceived risk of further measures, combined with the  possibility of Russian retaliation, may impede Russian issuers' access to the  international debt markets. However, any interruption should not present a  serious problem for LUKOIL because of the company's healthy liquidity and  moderate debt burden, as well as access to the domestic debt markets.  Russia-Focused Upstream In 2013 Russia accounted for over 90% of LUKOIL's proved oil and gas reserves  and production. We believe that the higher state presence in the oil sector  potentially puts private Russian O&G companies, such as LUKOIL, at a  disadvantage, as state-owned companies are likely to receive preferential  treatment in licence block allocation and other support. However, this should  not significantly affect LUKOIL's creditworthiness in the medium term, taking  into account its 21 years of proved reserve life at end-2013.  West Qurna 2 Launched  In March 2014 LUKOIL launched its Iraq West Qurna 2 (WQ2) project, of which it  holds 75% and which we believe could soon be recognised as Russia's first large  successful O&G project abroad. The commercial production at the field reached  120mbbl/d at end-March, and LUKOIL will need to maintain output at this level up  to end-June to be entitled to cost recovery. In 2011-1Q14, LUKOIL invested  USD4bn in WQ2, and we expect the company to recover its initial costs in  2014-2015, and the project to become self-financing from 2016. Although WQ2's  successful implementation will have a positive effect on LUKOIL's international  reputation and may help the company secure new large projects abroad, its impact  on LUKOIL's credit profile will be limited, as the USD1.15/bbl fee to be  received by LUKOIL under the service contract will not substantially benefit the  company's cash flows, even when the project reaches its 1.2mmbbl/d full  capacity. If LUKOIL fails to recover its initial WQ2 costs in 2014-2015 (e.g. due to lower  than expected production or geopolitical reasons) its funds from operations  (FFO) net adjusted leverage will still be below our negative rating guidance and  we are unlikely to take negative rating action, unless the amount of unrecovered  investments substantially rises.Stabilising Russian Oil Volumes  In 2013 LUKOIL's crude output in Russia increased by 1% year-on-year (yoy), due  mainly to USD2.5bn upstream M&A. This is an improvement on 2012, when it  reported a 1% drop in Russian crude production, and particularly on 2011, with a  5% yoy decline. We expect that LUKOIL will stabilise oil production in Russia  due to continued utilisation of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing on  brownfield sties in Western Siberia and the development of greenfield sites,  including the Caspian shelf development and Timan-Pechora, and possibly more  M&A.  Rising But Still Moderate Leverage LUKOIL has historically maintained a strong credit profile, which allows the  company to finance its ambitious capex programme and pay higher dividends  without jeopardising its credit strength. We expect LUKOIL's FFO adjusted net  leverage to increase to 1.1x by 2016 and to 1.3x by 2018 from 0.6x at end-2013.  This is mainly due to: (i) declining oil prices as per Fitch's Brent price deck,  (ii) lower profitability of downstream operations because the Russian government  intends to equalise export duty on crude and dark oil products from 2015; (iii)  high capital expenditure; and (iv) an increasing dividend payout. LUKOIL's FFO  interest cover should remain comfortably above 10x. Even if our conservative  assumptions are realised and LUKOIL's debt load increases, it should still  remain one of the least leveraged O&G companies both in Russia and  internationally.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - Positive rating action on Russia would be replicated on LUKOIL, as LUKOIL's  rating is currently capped by that of the sovereign and the company's Outlook  constrained by the sovereign Outlook. (e.g. the Outlook would be stabilised if  Russia's Outlook is stabilised). - A significant diversification beyond Russia could potentially allow us to rate  LUKOIL above the sovereign. However, we do not expect this to happen in the  medium term.   Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Negative rating action on Russia would be replicated on LUKOIL. - LUKOIL's aggressive investment programme, acquisitions or dividends, resulting  in FFO net adjusted leverage exceeding 2.5x and FFO interest coverage falling  below 10x on a sustained basis could lead to negative rating action. - Failure to stabilise production in Russia and higher production decline rates  for several consecutive periods could also trigger negative rating action. - An increasing amount of unrecovered investments in WQ2.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Sound Liquidity, Comfortable Maturities:  At end-2013, LUKOIL had USD1.7bn in cash and USD2.6bn in unutilised committed  credit lines compared with USD1.3bn of short-term debt. We believe LUKOIL may   need to moderately increase its debt level to finance its ambitious capex  programme and higher dividend payout as publically committed. If the  international debt markets remain unavailable for some time we expect LUKOIL  should be able to raise finance domestically. LUKOIL's debt maturities are well balanced. At end-2013 only 28% of its debt was  due within the next two years.
