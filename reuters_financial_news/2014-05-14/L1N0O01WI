WASHINGTON, May 14 (Reuters) - The FBI is getting more aggressive in pursuing cyber criminals and hopes to announce searches, indictments and multiple arrests over the next several weeks, the agency's official in charge of combating cyber crime said on Wednesday.

"There is a philosophy change. If you are going to attack Americans, we are going to hold you accountable," the FBI's Robert Anderson told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit. "If we can reach out and touch you, we are going to reach out and touch you." Anderson said the FBI would show "a much more offensive side" to it cyber program, which he took over in March.
