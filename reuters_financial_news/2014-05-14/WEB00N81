VIENNA, May 14 (Reuters) - Austrian property group Conwert <CONW.VI> said it would make a first-quarter loss of about 5.9 million euros ($8.1 million) as it would take a bigger hit from interest rate swaps.

Conwert said on Wednesday the non-cash impact would be around 18 million euros, mainly from interest rate swaps, almost four times the 5 million euros in non-cash negative effects it had a year earlier.
