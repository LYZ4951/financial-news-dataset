SINGAPORE, May 14 (Reuters) - Container shipper Neptune Orient Lines Ltd <NEPS.SI> posted a net loss of $97.9 million for the quarter ended April 4, a narrower loss from the previous quarter.

NOL, in which Singapore's state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] has a 67 percent stake, recorded a net profit of $75.5 million for the first quarter of 2013, which was a result of one-off gain on selling its corporate headquarter in Singapore. The company posted a 4 percent drop in revenue to $2.3 billion.
