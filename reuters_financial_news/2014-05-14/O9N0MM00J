OSLO, May 14 (Reuters) - Norway's revised 2014 budget, to be unveiled later on Wednesday, will increase spending by 1.9 billion crowns ($320 million) compared to a November proposal, news agency NTB reported, citing government documents.

The structural budget deficit is now seen at 2.8 percent of the $860 billion sovereign wealth fund, known as the oil fund, below a November forecast of 2.9 percent, NTB added. The government can spend up to 4 percent of the oil fund each year and even though spending has been rising in nominal terms, it has been on a decline as a percentage of the fund because of its rapid growth.
