FRANKFURT, May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. drugs wholesale group McKesson <MCK.N> plans to offer shareholders, which did not tender their shares in Celesio <CLSGn.DE>, a compensation of 22.99 euros a share as it seeks full control over the German peer.

"This stock exchange price which is relevant for the compensation exceeds the value of 22.42 euros per Celesio share as determined by (auditor) KPMG in the valuation of Celesio AG," Celesio said in a statement.  It added that Celesio's executive board and McKesson on Wednesday started consultations on a so-called domination and profit transfer agreement, which will allow the U.S. group to take full control and gain access to the German company's cash flows. Minority investors who stay on board after a takeover bid has succeeded typically challenge the compensation they are offered in court. Some hedge funds specialise in this strategy, dubbed "playing the back end".
