FRANKFURT, May 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank could cut its deposit rate into negative territory as part of a package of policy measures, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said in a German newspaper interview released on Wednesday.

"Negative deposit rates are a possible part of a combination of measures," Praet told German weekly newspaper Die Zeit. "We are preparing a range of things. We could again lend banks money for a longer time frame, possibly with conditions attached," he added. Praet said he did not see the ECB embarking on U.S.-style quantitative easing (QE) - or money printing to buy assets - unless economic conditions deteriorated in the euro zone.
