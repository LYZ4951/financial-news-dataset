MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Foreign holdings of Italian bonds edged up to 652.1 billion euros ($894 billion) in February from 648.2 billion euros the month before, Bank of Italy data showed on Wednesday.

The percentage of the total held by non-Italians fell slightly, however, because the overall value of bonds in issue rose in February, Reuters calculations based on the data showed. Non-Italians held a 36.8 percent share compared with 37 percent in January. The data are at nominal value and include Italian bonds purchased by the European Central Bank as part of its bond-buying programme. The ECB's share is estimated at around 5 percent of the total.
