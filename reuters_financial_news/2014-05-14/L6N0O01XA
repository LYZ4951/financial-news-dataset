MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Fondazione Monte dei Paschi, the former top shareholder in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>, said on Wednesday Italy's central bank had authorised the sale of a 6.5 percent stake in the bank to two Latin American investors.

The banking foundation has sold 4.5 percent of Italy's third-largest bank to Fintech Advisory, a U.S.-based fund owned by Mexican businessman David Martinez, and another 2 percent to BTG Pactual Europe, a unit of Brazilian bank BTG Pactual. It has also sealed a shareholder pact with the two investors. The foundation said in a statement the Bank of Italy's authorisation follows that granted by Italy's Treasury.  It added it was now awaiting a green light from the Treasury to invest in an upcoming 5 billion-euro rights issue at the bank, whose size was recently increased from 3 billion euros pencilled in previously.
