WARSAW, May 14 (Reuters) - Eastern Europe's largest insurer PZU <PZU.WA> booked a 9-percent fall in its first quarter net profit, due to a dip in the Polish group's written premiums, it said on Wednesday.

The state-controlled group showed a bottom line of 760 million zlotys ($249.18 million), below market estimates of 781 million zlotys.
