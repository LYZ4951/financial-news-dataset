ZURICH, May 14 (Reuters) - Julius Baer <BAER.VX> said on Wednesday that four-month assets rose 4 percent from year-end to 264 billion Swiss francs ($296.70 billion), as it won fresh funds from clients and added a recent Brazilian acquisition to its assets.

In a four-month statement, the Swiss private bank said net new money was within its target, which is 4 to 6 percent, and that its gross margin on assets rose to 95 basis points, up from 91 basis points in the second half.
