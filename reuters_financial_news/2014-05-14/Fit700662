May 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Grand Harbour B.V.'s EUR403,172,612 m class A-1 floating rate notes at 'AAAsf' with a Stable Outlook. Grand Harbour I B.V. is an arbitrage cash flow collateralised loan obligation  (CLO). Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to purchase a  EUR400m portfolio of European leveraged loans and bonds. The portfolio is  managed by Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Europe Limited, and went effective on 19  August 2013. The reinvestment period is scheduled to end in 2016.KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the stable performance of the transaction since it  closed in June 2013. Credit enhancement for the sole rated tranche in the deal  is up marginally to 40.5% from 40.0%. Two months after closing, the portfolio successfully ramped up. Currently, the  majority of assets are rated 'B' (56%), with 78.1% of assets rated 'B' or above.  The 'CCC' assets account for 1.3% of the transaction's par value, attributable  to two obligations from the same issuer. The maximum 'CCC' exposure bucket is  7.5%. The portfolio has a large industry concentration exposure to the computers and  electronics industry at 15.3% of total assets, with healthcare, the next largest  exposure accounting for just over 8.5%. France and Germany account for  approximately half of the assets' country exposure, with a 26.3% and 21.9%  share, respectively. The UK (13.1%) and Netherlands (13.0%) account for just  over a further quarter of all assets' location. Italy (5.8%), Ireland (1.9%) and  Spain (1.3%), all considered peripheral exposures (for which Fitch applies  additional stresses), together account for less than 10% of asset balance.  Obligations domiciled in countries rated 'A-' or below by Fitch are capped at  10%. The transaction's minimum weighted average spread (4.25%), weighted average  coupon (6%) and maximum weighted average rating factor (36) have not changed  since the effective date with current levels compliant, along with all portfolio  profile and coverage and quality tests.
