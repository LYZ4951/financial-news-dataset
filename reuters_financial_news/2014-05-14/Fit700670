May 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Japan's Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+'. The issue ratings on Japan's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds are also affirmed at 'A+'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Negative. The Country Ceiling is affirmed at 'AA+' and the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F1+'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The affirmation of Japan's 'A+' IDRs with Negative Outlooks reflects the  following key rating drivers: - Japan's public finances are its key credit and rating weakness. Gross general  government debt (GGD) was 237.2% of GDP at end-2013, the highest of any  Fitch-rated sovereign. Japan's cyclically-adjusted primary deficit was 7% of GDP  in 2013 according to data from the International Monetary Fund, much higher than  the average of 2% for the Group of -20 advanced countries. The agency expects  Japan's gross GGD ratio to peak at 245% in 2020 in its baseline projection. Debt  dynamics analysis indicates Japan's public debt sustainability is vulnerable to  fiscal slippage or other negative shocks.  - The Japanese sovereign's financial position is less of an outlier compared  with advanced-economy peers in net terms because of the sovereign's large stock  of assets. However, Japanese general government net financial liabilities of  137.5% of GDP at end-2013 were still the highest among members of the  Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which include  Greece (122% of GDP), Italy (116.5%) and the US (81.2%). Japan's liabilities  have also risen rapidly from the recent trough of 80.5% of GDP at end-2007.  - Set against these vulnerabilities, the Japanese sovereign retains exceptional  funding flexibility. Yields on ten-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) fell to  0.72% on average over 2013 from 0.86% in 2012. The average maturity of the stock  lengthened to 7.5 years at end-2013 from 7.25 years at end-2012. This funding  strength partly reflects the role of the broader Japanese public sector in  funnelling the deep pool of Japanese private-sector savings into JGBs. The  broader public sector held about 46% of the JGB stock at end-2013. The Japanese  sovereign has relatively large deposits of about 16% of GDP, although from the  perspective of fiscal liquidity, this is offset against a heavy debt maturity  burden of about 70% of GDP per year (or 21% excluding short-term bills). - The Bank of Japan's policy of quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE) since  April 2013 is aimed at doubling Japan's monetary base within two years. The Bank  of Japan purchased a net JPY62.8trn of JGBs in the financial year to March 2014  (FY14), equal to 45% of gross issuance, taking its holdings to 17.1% of the  stock. Japanese QQE is a powerful demonstration of the policy flexibility  available to a sovereign issuing one of the world's main reserve currencies. The  Bank of Japan will face a challenge in withdrawing monetary accommodation  smoothly when macroeconomic conditions warrant, although this is also the case  for central banks in other major advanced economies. - Fiscal consolidation has begun in earnest with the imposition of a 3pp  increase in the consumption tax to 8% that took effect on 1 April. A general  government budget deficit of 7% in 2014, in line with Fitch's forecast, would be  the lowest since 2008. Fitch thinks there is a high chance that the government  will achieve its interim fiscal target of a 3.3% primary deficit for the central  and local government sectors, excluding earthquake reconstruction spending, in  FY15. This assumes the second scheduled consumption-tax increase to 10% takes  place in October 2015, as currently legislated, or that equivalent measures are  taken. However, further reduction of the deficit to a level consistent with debt  ratio stabilisation will require additional spending or revenue measures beyond  those currently proposed.   - Japan's economic performance is a credit weakness. Japan's five-year average  real GDP growth rate of 0.3% is much weaker than the median for 'A' range peers  of 3.3% and marginally weaker than the median for Fitch-rated advanced economies  of 0.5%. Most estimates of trend growth for the Japanese economy are between  0.5% and 1% per year. The shrinking working-age population weighs on potential  growth. Japan's multifactor productivity growth averaged 0.7% per year over  1992-2011, lagging other major economies including Germany (1%) and the US  (1.2%), according to OECD data. Persistent deflation since 1992 has undermined  nominal GDP growth and public debt dynamics. Nominal GDP of JPY478.4trn in 2013  was below the 1992 level of JPY480.8trn.  - Aggressive monetary policy action and fiscal accommodation ("Abenomics"),  coupled with the global recovery, support GDP growth - Fitch expects a 1.6%  expansion in 2014. But Japan's prospects of achieving sustainably higher real  and nominal GDP growth remain open to question. A self-sustaining inflationary  process is likely to require stronger wage growth, which has yet to take hold  unambiguously. Current structural reform plans appear insufficient, in Fitch's  judgement, to deliver the government's ambition of raising the real growth rate  to 2% per year on average over the decade to 2023, compared with the average of  0.8% per year over 1992-2012. - Japan's ratings are supported by strong sovereign credit fundamentals. These  include one of the world's most advanced, wealthy and diversified economies,  high standards of governance and strong public institutions. - Japan's external finances are a strength. The sovereign's foreign reserves  stockpile was USD1,279bn at end-March 2014, the world's second-biggest after  China (USD3,948bn). Japan's overall net external creditor position of 55% of GDP  at end-2013 was substantially stronger than the 'A' median of 20%. The trade  balance moved into deficit in 2011 for the first time since 1980, but Fitch  expects income inflows will keep the overall current account in surplus until  2015.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  The Negative Outlook reflects the following risk factors that may, individually  or collectively, result in a downgrade of the ratings: - Mounting evidence that the economy had failed to attain sustainably higher  nominal and real GDP growth compared with the 1992-2012 record  - Signs that the government had abandoned fiscal consolidation and debt  stabilisation as a policy objective, including for example, failure to implement  the second consumption tax increase scheduled for October 2015 without  compensating measures The current rating Outlook is Negative. Consequently, Fitch's sensitivity  analysis does not currently anticipate developments with a material likelihood,  individually or collectively, of leading to a rating upgrade. However, future  developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a stabilisation of  the Outlook include: - Articulation of a credible strategy for further consolidation of the budget  deficit that leads Fitch to bring forward its forecast for public debt ratio  stabilisation - Growing confidence that the economy's performance had strengthened durably,  including for example, expectations for stronger trend GDP growth, and/or  sustained modestly positive inflation   KEY ASSUMPTIONS The ratings and Outlooks are sensitive to the following assumptions: - Japanese sovereign funding conditions do not deteriorate substantially and in  a lasting way. A sharp and sustained increase in JGB yields would endanger  Japan's public solvency and could see the ratings downgraded by more than one  notch. However, Fitch considers this to be unlikely. Fitch assumes the eventual  exit from the Bank of Japan's <8301.T> policy of QQE will be orderly.  - No significant intensification of regional geopolitical disputes to a level  that would significantly disrupt economic behaviour
