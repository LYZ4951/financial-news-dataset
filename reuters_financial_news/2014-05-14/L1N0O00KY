TORONTO, May 14 (Reuters) - Canadian home prices rose in April and the pace of 12-month home price appreciation accelerated slightly, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index showed on Wednesday.

The index, which measures price changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed national home prices were up 0.5 percent last month, a modest reading compared to the usual spring surge and following a flat March.
