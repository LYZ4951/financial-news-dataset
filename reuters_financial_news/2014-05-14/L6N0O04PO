LAGOS, May 14 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Union Bank <UBN.LG> said on Wednesday it will seek shareholders' approval in June to raise up to $750 million in medium-term debt instrument.

Union Bank has been transforming its image after new investors recapitalised the lender three years ago following a central bank rescue of the institution in 2009.
