DAKAR, May 14 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund says it questions the rationale of and procedures that led to Mali buying a $40 million presidential jet given the country's pledges to fight poverty, a spokesman said.

The IMF has contacted Malian authorities about the purchase as well as a separate 100 billion CFA franc ($209.02 million) state guarantee issued to guarantee a loan secured by a private company with a Malian bank to provide supplies for the army, the spokesman said.
