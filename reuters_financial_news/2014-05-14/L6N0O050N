MOSCOW, May 14 (Reuters) - Russia will achieve a federal budget surplus worth 0.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2014, the Economy Ministry forecast on Thursday, a stronger budget position than previously expected.

The revised forecast is contained in new official mid-term economic projections to be presented to the government on Thursday.  Under its existing budget plan Russia had projected a deficit in 2014 of 0.5 percent of GDP. However, senior finance ministry officials have since said that a balanced budget or small surplus is possible this year. On Tuesday, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said that Russia is scaling back its borrowing plans this year, shelving plans to borrow $7 billion on the foreign debt market, as a weaker rouble and strong oil prices are boosting government revenues. [ID:nL6N0NZ5DR] The new Economy Ministry forecasts project the federal budget moving into deficit in 2015-2016, with the deficit estimated at between 0.4 percent and 1 percent of GDP, depending on economic conditions. It projected the deficit ranging between 0.8 percent and 1.8 percent in 2017. Russia's existing budget plan envisaged a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2015 and 0.6 percent of GDP in 2016.
