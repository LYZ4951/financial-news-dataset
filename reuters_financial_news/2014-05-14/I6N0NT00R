MILAN, May 14 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> fell around 2 percent in early trade on Wednesday after Italy's fourth-biggest bank by branches posted weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter due to big loan loss charges.

By contrast, peer UBI <UBI.MI> was up 1.3 percent in a flat Milan stock market after its net profit for the first three months of the year came in slightly above analyst forecasts.
