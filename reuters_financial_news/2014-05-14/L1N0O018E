NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc <CSCO.O> posted a lower-than-expected 5.5 percent decline in quarterly revenue, as the company faces sluggish demand for hardware.

Cisco reported revenue of $11.5 billion, down from $12.2 billion a year earlier. Wall Street on average had expected $11.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
