May 14 (Reuters) - Catlin Group Ltd <CGL.L>, operator of the biggest syndicate in the Lloyd's of London insurance market, said first-quarter gross premiums written rose 9 percent, helped in part by continued growth of its reinsurance business at Catlin Re Switzerland and new business wins for energy and marine products in Asia Pacific.

The Bermuda-based company, whose insurances range from property and aviation to energy and kidnapping, said although it incurred no catastrophe losses during the quarter, its books reflect one single-risk loss relating to the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines <MASM.KL> flight MH370.
