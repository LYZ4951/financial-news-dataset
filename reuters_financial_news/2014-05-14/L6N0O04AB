SARAJEVO, May 14 (Reuters) - Islamic Development Bank (IDB) [ISDBA.UL], a Jeddah-based multilateral institution, plans to issue a benchmark-sized Islamic bond or sukuk in around May next year, the bank's President Ahmad Mohamed Ali said on Wednesday.

In February, IDB, which has a top-notch AAA rating, priced a $1.5 billion, five-year sukuk, its largest ever Islamic bond.

"We are planning to go to the market every year but the amount will depend on different factors. We will inspect the needs of the bank and the conditions on the market," Ali said. He said that IDB, an international lender which has 56 member states and promotes economic development in Muslim countries, was considering whether to guarantee Tunisia's proposed 700 million dinar ($431.79 million) debut sukuk. The Tunisian issue is aimed at helping the North African economy recover after being hit by the 2011 uprising. [ID:nL5N0LB165]  The issue had been planned for April or May but Tunisia's central bank governor has said it was complex and was likely to take longer. [ID:nL5N0MR0SG] "No decision has been taken yet," said Ali. He added that IDB's insurance arm, the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), is also debating whether to extend a sukuk insurance product to boost the credit rating of Tunisia's sukuk.ICIEC launched the insurance product last year, viewing that the insurance policy could help sovereign issuers tap into strong investor demand for investment-grade sukuk. "It is a new product. This is just a proposal and it is  still under consideration," Ali said. But he said that IDB might consider subscribing to the Tunisian sukuk.
