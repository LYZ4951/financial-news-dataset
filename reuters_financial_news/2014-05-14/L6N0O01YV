WARSAW, May 14 (Reuters) - Romania's first quarter economic growth published on Thursday is likely to top 3.5 percent, the country's budget minister said on Wednesday, adding full year growth should exceed 4 percent.

"Based on industrial production figures... I would say at least 3.5 percent growth for the first quarter, actually on the upside of 3.5 percent," Romania's budget minister, Liviu Voinea, said at the EBRD's annual meeting in the Polish capital. "For whole of 2014 it has very good chance of exceeding 4 percent."
