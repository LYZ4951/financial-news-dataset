May 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Weak fiscal performances and outlooks are constraining the ratings of Spain's autonomous communities, despite the improvement in the Spanish sovereign credit profile, Fitch Ratings says. In particular, the sector's negative current balance highlights structural imbalances for some regions. Hence there was no impact on our ratings of the autonomous communities  following our upgrade of the Spanish sovereign to 'BBB+' in April. Our ratings  floor, indicating probable sovereign support, remains in place.  Upgrades to Fitch-rated autonomous communities would be driven by a sustained  improvement in credit fundamentals, or a rise in the ratings floor from 'BBB-'.  As long as the mechanisms by which the sovereign can provide support remain  largely unchanged, the latter is unlikely, even if the sovereign is upgraded  further.  Preliminary results for last year show a weak, albeit improving, overall  operating performance by the Spanish regions. Operating expenditure exceeded  operating revenue for the fourth consecutive year and the aggregate current  balance remained negative, although both shortfalls were considerably smaller  than in 2012. Six regions had positive current balances, but all of these had  weak current margins. Four regions had negative current balances exceeding 10%  of current revenue.  While aggregate operating performance and fiscal outturns are improving, the  current balance indicates a region's capacity to fund recurrent spending.  Repeated negative current balances mean debt repayment must be funded from debt  issuance, and this is a structural problem for several regions. Further spending  cuts may prove more challenging without reforms in areas such as healthcare and  spending. Meanwhile tax allocations from central government will fall this year,  and several autonomous regions are budgeting for a negative current balance in  2014 as a result.  Despite this recurrent weakness, we think the improvement so far is in line with  the expectations of central government, which therefore remains willing to  provide timely liquidity support if needed. The maintenance of our ratings floor  reflects this.  The floor is unchanged at 'BBB-' following the sovereign upgrade. An investment  grade floor is based on supporting factors such as the EUR23bn Regional  Liquidity Fund (FLA) and the Budgetary Stability Law (BSL), both introduced in  2012, as well as the legal priority given to debt servicing, and the  government's decision to allow a negative tax settlement to be repaid over 10  years. The BSL has not been applied as rigorously as anticipated, but we think  it provides a useful mechanism to help the regions meet central government  targets. If these factors were strengthened, the floor could rise.  The floor would be sensitive to a downgrade of the sovereign to 'BBB-' or below.  Six Fitch-rated autonomous communities are rated at this level, and four at  'BBB'. For the 'BBB' rated autonomous communities, we consider that there has  been no material structural improvement in financial performance, and none is  expected in the near future.
