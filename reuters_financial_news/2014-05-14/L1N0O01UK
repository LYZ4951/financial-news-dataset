NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart <WMT.N> shares fell sharply in an instant as volume spiked late on Wednesday afternoon, in an out-of-the-ordinary mini "flash crash," data showed.

In less than one second, the stock of the world's largest retailer tumbled from $78.66 to $78.06. Within a minute, the stock rebounded, with nearly 250,000 shares changing hands between 3:20 p.m. EDT and 3:21 p.m. in 11 exchanges. It was the busiest minute this week in Wal-Mart trading outside of trades at the close. Seven of the 11 lowest prints were odd-lot trades, or trades of less than 100 shares, and the bid-ask spread widened in some cases to 4 or 5 cents, an unusual occurrence in a widely followed and held stock.
