NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group <AIG.N> on Wednesday said that it had completed the sale of its aircraft leasing unit to AerCap Holdings <AER.N>, marking the end of years of efforts to sell International Lease Finance Corp.

The sale also marks AIG's exit from its last non-core business, just a few years after sour derivative bets nearly wiped out the company. While the insurer has paid back a U.S. bailout and even reinstituted a dividend since the crisis, it is now a smaller, more narrowly focused company than before. AIG received $3.0 billion of cash and 97,560,976 newly issued AerCap common shares, according to an AIG statement, for a total value of about $7.6 billion based on AerCap's closing price per share of $47.01 on Tuesday. Net cash proceeds to AIG were approximately $2.4 billion after the settlement of intercompany loans, the statement added. AIG said in December 2012 that it had reached a deal to sell up to 90 percent of ILFC to a group of investors based mainly in China for $4.7 billion, but the deal never went through. Netherlands-based AerCap buys aircraft and rents them to airlines.
