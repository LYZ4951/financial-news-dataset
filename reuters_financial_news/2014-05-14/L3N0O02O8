HONG KONG, May 14 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc's <BARC.L> top mergers and acquisitions banker for the Asia Pacific region, Jason Rynbeck, left the firm on May 8, according to a regulatory filing with Hong Kong's Securities & Futures Commission.

Rynbeck, as vice chairman for M&A Asia Pacific, was the Britain-based bank's top mergers banker in the region following the transfer of M&A head Ed King to the United States last November.  Rynbeck, a former head of M&A at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc <RBS.L>  in Asia, was poached by Barclays in 2008 as it brought on a raft of senior investment bankers in the region as part of a post-financial crisis expansion plan. Rynbeck could not immediately be reached for comment.
