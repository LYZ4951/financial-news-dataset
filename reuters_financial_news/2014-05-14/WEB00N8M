PARIS, May 14 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas, <BNPP.PA> France's biggest bank, said there is a risk that a possible fine for violating U.S. sanctions on countries like Iran could be significantly higher than the $1.1 billion euros it has provisioned for.

Chief Executive Laurent Bonnafe told a shareholders meeting that the bank will continue talks with U.S. authorities about probes into whether his bank has violated U.S. sanctions. "We are doing what we can to insure that such mistakes do not occur in the future," Bonnafe said.
