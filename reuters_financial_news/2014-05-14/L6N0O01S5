LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - European stock markets were steady in early trading on Wednesday, hovering near multi-year highs, while Britain's Compass Group <CPG.L> outperformed after unveiling a special dividend payout.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which on  Tuesday had closed up 0.3 percent near a 6-year high, was flat at 1,368.76 points. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> was also flat at 3,212.33 points while Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> rose 0.2 percent to 9,771.40 points, putting the DAX back within reach of a record high of 9,794 points reached in January. Some traders said the rally witnessed over the last two months, which has seen the FTSEurofirst 300 rise some 7 percent from lows in March, may run out of steam as investors look for an opportunity to cash in on that rise.
