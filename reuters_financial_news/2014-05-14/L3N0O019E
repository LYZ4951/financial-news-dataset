HANOI, May 14 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> gained 1.38 percent on Wednesday, recovering from a two-day losing streak, supported by value-buying as share prices have become more attractive, traders said.

The index had lost a combined 5.3 percent after two falls on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to continued tension over a sea dispute with China.

Vietcombank <VCB.HM> rose 6.58 percent, followed by Vietnam's largest insurer by market share, Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM>, which increased 5.41 percent, while Petrovietnam Gas <GAS.HM> - the country's top listed firm by market value - lost 0.56 percent.Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).VN Index   521.01PREV.
