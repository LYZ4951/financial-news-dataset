LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - "Lucy", starring Scarlett Johansson as a woman with a super-powered brain, collected $44 million to win at domestic box offices outmuscling "Hercules", but both releases helped pump life into a lackluster summer at U.S. and Canadian theaters.

"Hercules", starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in the title role, took in $29 million for second place, while "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" which topped the box office the past two weekends, finished third with $16.4 million. "Lucy", directed by French action film specialist Luc Besson, stars Johansson as a traffic-stopping, object-moving woman whose brain operates at abnormally high levels after a drug is planted in her body. The special effects-laden film was made for a relatively inexpensive $40 million, according to the movie site Box Office Mojo. Made for a brawny $100 million, "Hercules" got mixed reviews from both critics and moviegoers, according to the site Rotten Tomatoes, with 50 of 80 reviewers giving it a "fresh" rating and  68 percent of those who saw it saying they liked it. Both films exceeded opening weekend industry expectations. "Lucy" was released by Universal, a unit of Comcast <CMCSA.O>. Viacom's <VIAB.O> Paramount Pictures studio and MGM jointly released "Hercules". Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox <FOXA.O>, released "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes".
