DUBAI, July 27 (Reuters) - Markets in the region look likely to consolidate in quiet trade on Sunday ahead of a long break for Eid al Fitr holidays, with bourses in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait already closed and the United Arab Emirates set to close as soon as on Monday. [ID:nL6N0PY2LL]

Dubai builder Arabtec <ARTC.DU> may come under pressure after its second-quarter profit missed analysts' estimates. The company earned 103 million dirhams ($28.1 million) in the quarter, while analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast 111 million dirhams. [ID:nL6N0Q10OK] Another concern for investors is whether Arabtec's former chief executive Hasan Ismaik, who abruptly resigned last month, may sell more shares on the market. Ismaik sold about $4 million worth of Arabtec shares last week, cutting his stake to 28.77 percent from 28.85 percent. [ID:nL6N0Q02N6] Arabtec dropped 19.2 percent last week after Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments, the firm's second-largest shareholder, did not confirm a report which said Aabar was in talks to increase its stake. Another Dubai firm, shipper Aramex <ARMX.DU>, reported a 12 percent rise in second-quarter net profit late on Thursday, which was in line with analyst estimates, despite a one-off cost related to its acquisition of courier firm Australian Mail Call. During this earnings reporting season, investors in Dubai have often followed a "buy the rumour, sell the fact" pattern and as a resullt, a number of stocks have dipped even after beating estimates.
