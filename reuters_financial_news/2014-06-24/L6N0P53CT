YEREVAN, June 24 (Reuters) - Armenia's central bank cut its key refinancing rate to 7 percent from 7.25 percent on Tuesday after data showed annual inflation was within the government's 2014 target.

Annual inflation was 3.6 percent in May, the central bank said, down from 4.4 percent recorded in April. That is within the government's target range of between 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent for 2014. Monthly deflation in May was 0.8 percent, compared to inflation of 0.5 percent in April.
