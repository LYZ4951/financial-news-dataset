RIO DE JANEIRO, June 24 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank on Tuesday announced it will extend its foreign exchange intervention program without changes until at least the end of the year.

The bank said in a statement it will offer $200 million worth of currency swaps in daily auctions from Mondays through Fridays - the same amount it currently offers to investors seeking protection against possible currency losses.
