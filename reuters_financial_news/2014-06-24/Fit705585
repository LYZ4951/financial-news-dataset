June 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC's <PABC.CM> (PABC) National Long-Term Rating at 'BBB(lka)'. The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also affirmed PABC's outstanding subordinated debentures at 'BBB-(lka)'.  KEY RATING DRIVER PABC's rating reflects its small but expanding franchise, weak asset quality,  declining capitalisation and low profitability relative to higher rated peers. Loan growth at the bank was well below the industry's as a whole in 2013. Fitch  believes that the bank's new management will seek to accelerate loan growth to  meet the bank's targets for asset growth. PABC's asset quality weakened sharply,  in line with the scenario across the sector, with reported gross non-performing  loan ratio of 7.8% as at end-March 2014 (end-2013: 8%), higher than the industry  levels. Fitch is of the view that asset quality risks could persist in the  bank's pursuit of growth. Fitch expects the above risks to keep capitalisation under pressure in the  absence of fresh capital. PABC's Fitch core capital ratio, which is lower than  its peers', has steadily decreased to 9.3% as at end-March 2014 from 10.1% at  end-2013 and 13.1% at end-2012. PABC's profitability has been significantly  reduced by high impairment charges with return on assets of 0.5% in 1Q14 and  0.19% in 2013.  Acquiring and sustaining a strong current and savings account (CASA) base is  likely to remain a challenge for PABC due to its modest, albeit slowly expanding  franchise. PABC's current and savings accounts stood at 21% of total deposits as  at end-March 2014 and 18% at end-2013. The subordinated debt is rated one notch below the issuer rating to reflect its  gone-concern loss-absorption quality in the event of liquidation, in line with  Fitch's criteria for rating such securities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating could come under pressure if there is a further weakening in its  asset quality and capitalisation.  An upgrade is unlikely given its capital  profile, asset quality and pressure on earnings.
