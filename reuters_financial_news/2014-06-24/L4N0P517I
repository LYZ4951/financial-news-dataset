June 24 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian indexes rose on Tuesday tracking Asian markets, bolstered by encouraging manufacturing data from China, Japan, and the United States that pointed to a recovery in global economic growth.

Manufacturing surveys, leading indicators of output trends, showed factory activity in the U.S., China and Japan rose strongly in May. [ID:nL6N0P41OV]  Thai shares, however, bucked the larger trend in the region to fall 0.9 percent led by banks, after most lenders reported a drop in loan growth in May.  Krung Thai Bank PCL <KTB.BK> and Siam Commercial Bank PCL <SCB.BK> fell 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.   In Jakarta, Shares of PT Bumi Resources Tbk <BUMI.JK> surged nearly 22 percent after a sharp sell-off the previous day that saw it hitting a 11-year low, on concerns about the coal miner's ability to repay debt.
