June 24 (Reuters) - Aetna Inc <AET.N>, the third largest U.S. health insurer, is exploring a sale of some of Coventry Health Care Inc's assets worth as much as $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, a year after it acquired its rival for $5.6 billion.

Aetna is working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N> on a sale process for Coventry's workers' compensation business that is expected to attract interest from other companies in the sector as well as private equity firms. Aetna and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment. The sale process reaffirms that Aetna's acquisition of Coventry was always about boosting its share of the fast-growing, U.S. government-backed Medicare and Medicaid programs. Aetna has its own workers' compensation business called Workers' Comp Access. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company completed the acquisition of Coventry in May 2013.  The business for sale offers cost and care management services to underwriters and administrators of workers' compensation insurance, as well as employers.
