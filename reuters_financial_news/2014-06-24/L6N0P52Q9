TEL AVIV, June 24 (Reuters) - Israeli energy and insurance conglomerate Delek Group <DLEKG.TA> said on Tuesday it agreed to sell its 46.6 percent stake in Barak Capital to Eyal Bakshi, controlling shareholder of Barak Capital, for 237 million shekels ($69 million).

Delek said 100 million shekels will be paid in cash in two instalments while the remaining 137 million will be granted as a three-year loan by Delek to Barak. The loan will carry annual interest of 7 percent. "Currently, the company is examining the accounting implications of this agreement, if the transaction is completed, on the financial statements," Delek said in a statement. The sale comes as Delek, which owns stakes in the giant Tamar and Leviathan natural gas fields off Israel's Mediterranean coast, seeks to divest its financial holdings.
