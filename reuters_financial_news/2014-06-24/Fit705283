June 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Thanachart Bank  Public Company Limited's [TCAPBK.UL] (TBANK) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'  and its majority shareholder Thanachart Capital Public Company Limited's <TCAP.BK> (TCAP)  National Long-Term Rating at 'A(tha)'. The Outlook is Negative.  A full list of rating actions is included at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - TBANK TBANK's IDRs, VR, and National Ratings take into account its domestic franchise  as the sixth largest commercial bank in Thailand, and its leading market  position in auto hire purchase. Fitch expects continued ordinary support from  its 49%-shareholder the Bank of Nova Scotia <BNS.TO> (BNS; AA-/Stable), particularly in  operations and risk management. The bank benefited from a one-off gain from the  sale of its subsidiary Thanachart Life Assurance in 2Q 2013. TBANK has shown  improvements in capitalisation, funding and reserve coverage over the past three  years.  The bank's recent sound performance has reduced the risk of a downgrade. However  the ratings Outlook remains negative; this is driven by Thailand's challenging  operating environment and economic outlook, which may have further uncertain  impact on TBANK's performance. The operating environment contributed to an  uptick in TBANK's NPL ratio, which already is relatively high (4.6% in 1Q 2014)  compared with sector averages. However,  the overall financial profile of the  bank remains comparable to 'bbb-' local and regional peers.  The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor of TBANK reflect Fitch's view that  there is a moderate probability of support from the government, in case of need.  This is due to the bank's systemic importance to the domestic financial sector,  as a medium-sized commercial bank with a market share for loans of around 7%.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - TBANK An ability to sustain recent improvements in its credit profile, particularly in  the face of the uncertain operating environment, would lead to a revision of the  Outlook to Stable  Meanwhile, a material reversal of recent gains in key financial measures such as  leverage and liquidity, along with a decline in TBANK's performance relative to  its peers, could lead to a downgrade. Nevertheless, Fitch expects the bank's  buffers to be sufficient for weathering a normal economic downturn without any  negative ratings action.  An increase in the shareholding of BNS, and in its level of control of the bank,  could be a positive ratings driver.KEY RATING DRIVERS - TCAP TCAP's National Ratings are notched down from its core operating subsidiary  TBANK, to reflect its structural subordination, a reliance on dividend payments  from TBANK, and the presence of large minority interests. The Outlook matches  that of TBANK.  TCAP's Support Rating reflects Fitch's expectation that there can be no reliance  on sovereign support, due to the holding company structure and the likelihood  that any support would be applied at TBANK rather than TCAP.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - TCAP Any change in TBANK's ratings could have a corresponding impact on TCAP.  A significant deterioration in TCAP's liquidity or leverage profile could result  in a wider notching from TBANK.   The list of rating actions is as follows:  TBANK Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Negative Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A+(tha)'; Outlook Negative National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(tha)' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-'  TCAP National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A(tha)' ; Outlook Negative National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1(tha)' Support Rating affirmed at '5'
