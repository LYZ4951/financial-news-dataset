WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday gave four banks more time to resubmit capital distribution plans it had earlier objected to, saying this would give the firms more time to address capital planning weaknesses.

The four banks, which had asked for the extension, are Citigroup Inc <C.N>, HSBC North America Holdings, Inc. <HSBA.L>, RBS Citizens, Inc <RBS.L> and Santander Holdings USA, Inc. <SAN.MC>. The banks were originally scheduled to submit their plans by June 26, but now have until Jan. 5, 2015.
