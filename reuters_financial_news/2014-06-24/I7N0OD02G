ISTANBUL, June 24 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank cut its one-week repo rate by 75 basis points to 8.75 percent on Tuesday citing an improvement in global liquidity conditions, but stopped short of the large cut sought by some in Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government.

The bank kept its overnight lending rate at 12 percent and its overnight borrowing rate at 8 percent.
