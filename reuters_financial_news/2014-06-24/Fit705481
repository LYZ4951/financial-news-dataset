June 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has today revised the Outlook on CS Energy  Limited's (CS Energy) Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to  Negative from Stable. The agency has simultaneously affirmed CS Energy's  Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs at 'AA' and 'F1+' respectively.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Outlook Revision: The revision in Outlook to Negative from Stable follows the  inclusion of proceeds from sales of state-owned generation companies in  Queensland, including CS Energy, in the state budget in June 2014, increasing  the possibility of privatisation of these entities. The rating of CS Energy is  currently closely linked to the ratings of the state of Queensland. Weakening Linkages with State: The Outlook revision reflects a weakening in the  strategic linkages between the State of Queensland (QLD, 'AA'/Stable) and the  company, should the entity be privatised, as viewed under Fitch's  parent-subsidiary rating methodology. The proposed timing of this transaction  is, however, only likely after the next state election due in mid-2015, given  the state government's commitment to seek a public mandate through the state  election. A sale of the assets can lead to a material weakening of the rating  linkages with the state leading to a multiple-notch downgrade of CS Energy's  ratings to a level consistent with its stand-alone credit profile.   Integrated with the State: Queensland Treasury Corporation [QTC.UL] (QTC, 'AA'/Stable),  the state borrowing authority, provides CS Energy with long-term funding and  short-term liquidity. The state also effectively controls the appointment of CS  Energy's board, and its capex and cash distribution policies. Standalone Credit Profile: CSE's standalone credit profile reflects its merchant  generation business and consequent exposure to wholesale pool prices. Financial  performance for the financial year to end-June 2013 (FY13) continues to be  affected by weak electricity demand growth, surplus generation capacity in  Queensland and lower than targeted generation output from disruption in  availability of coal supplies. CSE also incurred sizeable emission costs in  FY13, which were higher than it was able to recover from the market.  Higher Future Plant Utilisation: CSE's generation mix comprises predominantly of  coal-fired generation. Higher domestic gas prices and lower emissions-related  costs, expected under the new Federal government policy, enhance the  considerable cost advantage of coal-fired generation over competing gas-fired  generation. CSE's financial performance in future will benefit from higher  coal-fired generation plant utilisation as well as from a repeal of current  emissions legislation.   CS Energy is a Queensland state-owned power generator, with a trading generation  capacity of 4,035 megawatts across four sites, from a mixture of coal-fired and  pumped storage hydro power generation.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Considered unlikely given the likely announcement of sale/lease of  these assets at the next state election  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:  -Downgrade in Queensland's ratings
