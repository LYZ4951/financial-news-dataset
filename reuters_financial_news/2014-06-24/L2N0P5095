NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday, suggesting investors continued to search for direction following a sharp rally that took indexes to records last week.

* Equities had a quiet session on Monday, with trading volume light and moves so slight the S&P 500 had one of its narrowest intraday trading ranges ever, according to MKM Partners. That came after a six-day rally on the S&P that ended Friday, its longest streak since mid-April. * While Wall Street's trend upward was still viewed as intact, investors looked for fresh catalysts to justify more robust gains, and recent economic data has been mixed. * The latest economic indicators could give the market direction, with the April Case-Shiller report on home prices scheduled for release at 9:00 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) and data on both consumer confidence and home sales due at 10:00 a.m. * Confidence is seen coming in at 83.5 in June, little changed from 83 in May, while new home sales are seen rising modestly in May; this follows Monday's much stronger-than-expected report on May existing home sales. Home prices, based on the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index, are seen up 0.8 percent in April. * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> fell 4.5 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <1YMc1> fell 23 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> lost 7.5 points.  * Micron Technology Inc <MU.O> late Monday reported third-quarter results and a revenue outlook that both exceeded analysts' expectations. The stock, which is up 43.7 percent this year and more than tripled over 2013, edged 1.6 percent lower to $30.75 in premarket trading. [ID:nL2N0P41GC] * Abbott Laboratories <ABT.N> agreed to buy Russian drugmaker Veropharm <VRPH.MM> for up to $495 million. [ID:nL2N0P5069] * Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc <AAPL.O> suppliers will begin producing larger versions of the iPhone in China next month. The stock dipped slightly in premarket trading.
