MUMBAI, June 24 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose over 1 percent on Tuesday, snapping a four-day losing streak as blue-chips such as Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> rose on continued hopes of reforms while a fall in crude oil prices also helped.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 1.35 percent higher, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended up 1.16 percent.
