WARSAW, June 24 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) [EBRD.UL] plans to invest up to 50 million zlotys ($16.3 million) to buy around 5 percent in Polish private fund TFI Altus, the bank said on Tuesday.

Altus oversees assets worth over 5 billion zlotys across 36 funds. It would be the first mutual fund and asset management company in which EBRD has invested since its launch in 1991. The EBRD wants to buy the fund's shares in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO). Altus plans to debut on the Warsaw bourse <GPW.WA> next month. It will be offering shares worth up to 193 million zlotys. "With the capital raised in the IPO, we plan to scale up our business with a potential acquisition of a mid-sized investment fund manager," Altus Chief Executive Officer Piotr Osiecki said.
