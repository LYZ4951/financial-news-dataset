LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - Mortgage approvals in Britain last month fell to their lowest level since last August, though they are still 12 percent higher than a year earlier, seasonally adjusted data from the British Bankers' Assocation showed on Tuesday.

MAY  APRIL   MAY 2013 Net mortgage lending: +1.245+1.265-0.752 (change, bln stg)  MAY  APRIL   MAY 2013 Number of loans approved:  House purchase 41,75741,934   37,070 Remortgaging   18,20620,448   21,368 Other secured lending   5,168 7,9139,083  BBA chief economist Richard Woolhouse said: "Our figures indicate that the heat appears to be coming out of the housing market. "These are the first mortgage approval figures we have seen since the introduction of the Mortgage Market Review, so it is significant they have fallen for the fourth month in a row. "This is being driven by a drop in remortgaging and people borrowing against the value of their homes."
