LISBON, June 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank, Banco Espirito Santo, slumped 10 percent on Tuesday after new signs of discord within the founding family added to uncertainties about whether regulators and shareholders will accept a new CEO and governance plan.

The shares that at 0.763 euros are at their lowest levels since last October, have lost over 20 percent of their value in the past week, particularly after CEO Ricardo Espirito Santo agreed on Friday to step down and to be replaced by his CFO.  Jose Maria Ricciardi, a key member of the founding Espirito Santo family who had previously challenged Salgado's command of the bank, said late on Monday he would not be part of the group's social bodies after the family had turned down his own governance project.[ID:nL6N0P44CU] That means he will not be represented as planned on a new consultative council for BES, which is part of the new governance solution for the bank that still has to be approved by shareholders and the central bank.
