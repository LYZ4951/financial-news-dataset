June 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has today revised the Outlook on Australia's Ergon Energy Queensland Pty Ltd's (EEQ) Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Negative from Stable. The agency has simultaneously affirmed EEQ's Long-Term IDR and foreign currency Senior  Unsecured rating at 'AA'.  EEQ is a 100% owned subsidiary of Ergon Energy Corporation Limited (Ergon,  'AA'/Stable) . Ergon is a Queensland state-owned electricity distribution  company.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Outlook Revision: The revision in Outlook on EEQ's IDR follows the inclusion of  proceeds from sale of the energy retail business in Queensland in the state  budget in June 2014, increasing the possibility of privatisation of EEQ. EEQ is  a non-competitive electricity retailer with around 700,000 customers across  regional Queensland.  Weakening Strategic Linkages: The Outlook revision also reflects a weakening in  the strategic linkages between the State of Queensland (QLD, 'AA'/Stable) and  EEQ, should the entity be privatised, as viewed under Fitch's parent-subsidiary  rating methodology. The proposed timing of this transaction is, however, only  likely after the next state election due in mid-2015, given the state  government's commitment to seek a public mandate through the state election. A  sale of the assets can lead to a material weakening of the rating linkages with  the state leading to a multiple-notch downgrade of EEQ's ratings to a level  consistent with its stand-alone credit profile. Integrated with the State: The state borrowing authority, Queensland Treasury  Corporation [QTC.UL] (QTC, AA/Stable), arranges all of EEQ's debt. The virtually assured  availability of perpetual senior debt funding from QTC indicates a high degree  of financial integration with the state.  Weak Standalone Credit Profile: EEQ's unsupported credit profile will reflect  that of a pure retailer. In Fitch's view, a pure or standalone retailer  generally bears very high business risks. Retail margins tend to be relatively  thin, and standalone retailers will generally require significant working  capital and bank letters of credit to enable them to trade and cover settlement  risk. Other than receivables, these businesses have few assets to provide  collateral for secured bank funding should they experience a sharp deterioration  in credit profile.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Considered unlikely given the likely announcement of sale of these  assets following the next state election  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -Downgrade in the Queensland state's ratings
