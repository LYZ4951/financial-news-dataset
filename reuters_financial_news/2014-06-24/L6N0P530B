DUBAI, June 24 (Reuters) - Borse Dubai, the emirate's holding company for its stock exchanges, has refinanced a half-billion dollar loan at an ultra-low rate, setting the seal on its recovery from a financial crisis several years ago.

The company agreed this week to take a $500 million, three-year sharia-compliant loan from Dubai Islamic Bank <DISB.DU>, sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. This replaced a maturing three-year loan arranged by Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>. One source said the latest loan cost 90 basis points over the London interbank offered rate <LIBORS>, compared to 210-220 bps for the previous loan. Over the last several months, a string of United Arab Emirates companies have cut their borrowing costs by refinancing loans with cash-flush local banks, aided by improvement in the firms' credit profiles due to a strong economy. Borse Dubai's new loan is cheap even by those standards. [ID:nL5N0OQ1QP] Bankers worried in 2009 that Borse Dubai, the holding company for Dubai Financial Market (DFM) <DFM.DU> and NASDAQ Dubai, might default on its debt.  But Borse Dubai's finances have since then been strengthened by a recovery in the emirate's markets, despite a sharp pull-back in stock prices over the past few weeks. DFM's net profit surged eightfold from a year earlier to 215.1 million dirhams ($58.6 million) in the first quarter of 2014. [ID:nL6N0NF368]
