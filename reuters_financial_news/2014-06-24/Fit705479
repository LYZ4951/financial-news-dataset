June 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has today revised the Outlook on Stanwell  Corporation Limited's (Stanwell) Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) to Negative from Stable. The agency has simultaneously affirmed  Stanwell's Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs at 'AA' and 'F1+' respectively.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Outlook Revision: The revision in Outlook to Negative from Stable follows the  inclusion of proceeds from sales of state-owned generation companies in  Queensland, including Stanwell, in the state budget in June 2014, increasing the  possibility of privatisation of these entities. The rating of Stanwell is  currently closely linked to the ratings of the state of Queensland. Weakening Linkages with State: The Outlook revision reflects a weakening in the  strategic linkages between the State of Queensland (QLD, 'AA'/Stable) and the  company, should the entity be privatised, as viewed under Fitch's  parent-subsidiary rating methodology. The proposed timing of this transaction  is, however, only likely after the next state election due in mid-2015, given  the state government's commitment to seek a public mandate through the state  election. A sale of the assets can lead to a material weakening of the rating  linkages with the state leading to a multiple-notch downgrade of Stanwell's  ratings to a level consistent with its stand-alone credit profile.   Integrated with the State: Queensland Treasury Corporation [QTC.UL] (QTC, 'AA'/Stable) -  the state borrowing authority, provides Stanwell with long-term funding and  short-term liquidity. The state also effectively controls the appointment of  Stanwell's board, and its capex and dividend policies. Standalone Credit Profile: Stanwell's standalone credit profile reflects its  largely merchant generation business and substantial generation capacity in  Queensland. Improved financial performance in the financial year to end-June  2013 (FY13) reflects the benefit of portfolio restructuring as well as access to  competitive fuel supply sources. Its credit profile also benefits from an  incremental revenue stream from coal exports, direct sales to large industrial  customers and gas sales, which provides some cushioning to its variable merchant  generation revenue.  Higher Future Plant Utilisation: Stanwell's generation mix comprises  predominantly of coal-fired generation. Higher domestic gas prices and lower  emissions-related costs expected over the medium-term, enhance the considerable  cost advantage of coal-fired generation over competing gas-fired generation. As  such, Stanwell will benefit from higher coal-fired generation plant utilisation  over the medium-term. The improving cost advantage is also reflected in  Stanwell's decision to mothball its Swanbank E gas-fired generation plant and  recommission two (previously mothballed) units of its Tarong coal-fired  generation plant, announced on 5 February 2014. Future revenue growth will  benefit from direct gas sales at higher expected gas prices.  Stanwell is a Queensland state-owned power generator, with a total generation  capacity of 4,178 megawatts across 10 generation sites, from a mixture of hydro,  coal- and gas-fired power generation.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Considered unlikely given the likely announcement of sale/lease of  these assets at the next state election   Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:  -Downgrade in Queensland's ratings
