SOPOT, Poland, June 24 (Reuters) - Polish rate-setter Elzbieta Chojna-Duch said on Tuesday the Monetary Policy Council's core work will not be affected by the fact that the central bank governor Marek Belka was captured on tape using expletives about bank colleagues.

"In no way will the issues concerning the latest situation, the wiretaps, affect the council's substantive work," Chojna-Duch told reporters.
