June 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has today affirmed Australia's Ergon Energy Corporation Limited's (Ergon) Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and Foreign Currency Senior Unsecured rating at 'AA'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Linkages with State: Ergon's ratings reflect its very strong legal,  strategic and operational linkages with its sole owner, the State of Queensland  (AA/Stable). The state does not explicitly guarantee Ergon's obligations, but  Fitch believes the links are sufficiently strong to warrant equalisation of  Ergon's ratings with those of the state.  Strategically Important Business: Ergon's electricity distribution network  services the rural and regional areas of the state. The company is operationally  integral to the functioning of the state due to the economic and social  importance of its services. It also reflects the Queensland government's current  policy to retain its portfolio of network electricity assets in public  ownership, as also noted in the state budget on 3 June 2014. Integrated with the State: The state borrowing authority, Queensland Treasury  Corporation [QTC.UL] (QTC, AA/Stable), arranges all of Ergon's debt. The virtually  assured availability of perpetual senior debt funding from QTC indicates a high  degree of financial integration with the state, which effectively controls the  appointment of Ergon's board, as well as its capex and cash distribution  policies. Private Sector Investment: Fitch notes that state government expects private  sector investment in electricity network companies through a hybrid instrument,  for a share of revenue streams in future. However, Fitch also notes that the  state government remains committed to retaining full ownership of these  companies. Such investment is only likely after the next state election in  mid-2015. Any rating implications will include a review of the term sheet of the  hybrid instrument.   Strong Standalone Credit Profile: Ergon's standalone credit profile benefits  from the stable and predictable nature of cash flows generated by its monopoly  regulated distribution network, and the transparent regulatory environment in  which it operates. Ergon is a Queensland state owned electricity distribution  company which manages more than AUD11bn in distribution assets, with a network  spanning 97% of the state.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: -Upgrade in the Queensland state's ratings, provided the rating linkages remain  intact. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -Downgrade in the Queensland state's ratings; or
