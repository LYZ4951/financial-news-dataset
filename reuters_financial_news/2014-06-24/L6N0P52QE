JERUSALEM, June 24 (Reuters) - Israeli home sales slid 25 percent in April from March, led by a steep drop in purchases for investment, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.

Preliminary data for May indicate home sales were at the lowest level for the month of May since 2003. April's decline was also partly due to the timing of the seven-day Jewish Passover holiday, which fell in the middle of the month, the ministry said. Home sales for investment decreased by 30 percent in April and comprised just 24 percent of total sales. Purchases by young couples fell 21 percent, with most of the drop taking place in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Beersheba. Sales rose in the country's north but the ministry called this abnormal. During the first quarter, home sales fell 21 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. The lack of affordable housing has angered the public and is a major policy issue for both the government and Bank of Israel the past few years, as home prices have soared some 80 percent since 2007. The central bank has tightened mortgage rules and taken other steps aimed at halting the price rise, while urging the government to increase supply. Finance Minister Yair Lapid launched a controversial plan to allow young couples buying their first home to avoid paying the 18 percent value added tax, dependent on certain conditions. In keeping interest rates unchanged for a fourth straight month on Monday, the Bank of Israel said home prices rose at an annual rate of 8 percent in March-April, while the rate of new mortgages taken remains elevated. It noted that in the first quarter, there was a slowdown in building starts and completions as well as in the number of transactions.
