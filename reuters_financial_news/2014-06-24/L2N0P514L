WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday the U.S. Export-Import Bank is working with its internal inspector general on an investigation into improper gifts and kickbacks and said President Barack Obama has "zero tolerance" for waste, fraud and abuse.

But Obama supports reauthorizing the bank because it makes "a tangible and important contribution to the U.S. economy" and helps businesses expand trade and jobs, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.
