June 24 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc's <DAL.N> CEO is expected to support the U.S. Export-Import Bank's assistance for sales of Boeing Co's <BA.N> widebody jets, softening his stance at a time when critics are mounting pressure to wind down the agency, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Delta Airlines has long argued that Ex-Im Bank financing allows foreign competitors to buy Boeing planes on better credit terms than it can obtain. [ID:nL2N0EU1BE] Delta's chief executive, Richard Anderson, plans to use a speech at the Aero Club in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday to distance the company from the calls of some Republicans and small-government advocates for the bank to be wound down, the Journal said. (http://on.wsj.com/1wq8PT4) According to a draft of the speech obtained by the Journal, Anderson is expected to propose that the bank continue supporting sales of Boeing widebody jets to a limited number of airlines that lack alternative finance options, at least for as long as rival Airbus Group NV <AIR.PA> enjoys similar backing from European export-credit agencies. There is a heightened scrutiny of the Ex-Im Bank as U.S. lawmakers debate whether to reauthorize the 80-year-old agency. The newly elected No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives said on Sunday he opposed renewing its charter. [ID:nL2N0P30E4] Anderson is expected to emphasize in his speech that he doesn't want Ex-Im to shut down, arguing that the bank has a vital role in preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs, the daily reported. The Export-Import Bank backed $37.4 billion in exports in 2013. Scrapping the bank would be a blow to Boeing, Caterpillar <CAT.N>, General Electric <GE.N> and other U.S. companies that rely on Ex-Im financing to make sales in export markets where commercial lending is scarce.
