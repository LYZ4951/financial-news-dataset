WARSAW, June 24 (Reuters) - Support for Poland's governing Civic Platform party fell 4 percentage points after the publication of leaked remarks by senior officials that have embarrassed the government, a new poll showed, but the main opposition also lost ground.

Civic Platform (PO) had 24 percent support while the conservative opposition party, Law and Justice (PiS) had 31 percent, according to the survey conducted on June 23 by pollster TNS Polska for broadcaster TVP. The previous survey by the same pollster, on June 6-11, had PiS on 36 percent and PO on 28 percent. The big winner appeared to be the New Right Congress which had 10 percent in the latest poll, up from 4 percent in the poll TNS Polska conducted earlier this month. The party is led by Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who has said there is no proof that Adolf Hitler knew about the Holocaust, and that women should not vote because they are less intelligent than men. The same poll showed that 51 percent of those questioned favoured holding an early parliamentary election, while 36 percent were against. The next scheduled election is in late 2015. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said an early election could be an option if there is no other way of resolving the crisis over the leaked tapes.
