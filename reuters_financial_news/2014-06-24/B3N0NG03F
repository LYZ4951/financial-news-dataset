BUDAPEST, June 24 (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary cut its base interest rate by another 10 basis points on Tuesday, bringing it to a record low 2.3 percent <NBHI> as evidence of falling price pressures gave it further leeway to pursue growth-friendly policies.

The 23rd successive monthly reduction in the base rate was forecast by all analysts polled by Reuters last week.[ID:nL6N0P028J] The forint <EURHUF=D3> traded at 305.60 versus the euro, a tad firmer than 305.70 just before the announcement.
