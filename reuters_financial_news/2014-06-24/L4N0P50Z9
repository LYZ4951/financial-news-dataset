SEOUL, June 24 (Reuters) - South Korean shares logged their best day in six weeks on Tuesday as better-than-expected manufacturing surveys in the United States, China and Japan brightened prospects of a global recovery, prompting a rally in heavyweight exporters.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 1 percent at 1,994.35 points, the biggest daily percentage gain since a 1.1 percent rise on June 10. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>, two largest components in KOSPI, rose 1.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. Memorychip maker SK Hynix Inc <000660.KS>, the third largest, advanced 2.9 percent. The won <KRW=> held steady against the dollar as stock inflows were offset by importers' demand on the greenback.
