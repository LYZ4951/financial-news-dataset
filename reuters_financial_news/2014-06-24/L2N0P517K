WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc <DAL.N> chief executive Richard Anderson said on Tuesday he opposes reauthorization of the U.S. Export-Import Bank unless there are changes to the way the bank finances the sale of widebody aircraft.

"Without meaningful reform we are opposed to reauthorization," he said.
