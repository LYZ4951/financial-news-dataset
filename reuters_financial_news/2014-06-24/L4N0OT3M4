June 24 (Reuters) - Coal miners such as Cloud Peak Energy Inc <CLD.N> and Arch Coal Inc <ACI.N> in the Wyoming basin are having to wait to ship out coal as crude and grains crowd the railroads.

The delays are also forcing utilities to switch to more expensive natural gas. Revenue per car load for coal have declined for Union Pacific Corp <UNP.N> and Berkshire Hathaway Inc's <BRKa.N> Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC - the two rail road operators in the basin.UNION PACIFIC CORPAverage revenue per car (in $)   For Coal: Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  2,236   2,352   2,329For Chemicals: Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  3,307   3,255   3,225 For Agriculture:Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  3,815   3,846   3,694** Average dwell time (in hours)  Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  30.728.027.4   BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE LLC   Average revenue per car (in $)   For Coal:  Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  2,174   2,216   2,231 For Agriculture:  Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  4,136   4,153   3,734  Industrial Products:  Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  3,113   3,113   2,984  ** Average dwell time (in hours)  Q1 2014 Q4 2013 Q1 2013  31.629.025.1   ** Average dwell time is the time that loaded railcars spend in a terminal awaiting movement.
