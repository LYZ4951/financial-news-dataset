SYDNEY, July 29 (Reuters) - Shares of Australia's QBE Insurance Group <QBE.AX> dropped as much as 13.8 percent in early trade on Tuesday after the company warned higher claims in Latin America will hit its insurance profit margin and costs.

Its insurance profit margin is likely to be around 7-8 percent, compared with consensus expectations of around 10 percent. [ID:nL4N0Q35DM]
