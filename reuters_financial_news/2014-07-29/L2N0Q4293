NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, the largest securities brokerage in the United States by the number of advisers, added a top broker to its ranks from UBS Financial Services <UBSN.VX>, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed on Tuesday.

Robert Satterfield joined Morgan Stanley's Washington, D.C., office on Monday from a UBS office nearby where he managed $180 million in client assets and produced $1.6 million in revenue in the last 12 months, a source familiar with the move said.  A UBS spokesman declined to comment on Satterfield's departure.
