TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank plans to increase its outstanding overseas property non-recourse loans to 300 billion yen ($2.95 billion) by March 2017, from 50 billion yen now, a senior executive at Japan's fifth-largest bank by assets said on Tuesday.

"We are expanding overseas non-recourse loans as they have bigger returns than those in Japan," Akira Kamiyo, managing executive officer at the core unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings <8309.T>, told Reuters in an interview. He said his bank started providing non-recourse loans for office building projects in Singapore and London in early 2013.
