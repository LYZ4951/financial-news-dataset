SAO PAULO, July 29 (Reuters) - Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA>, the nation's largest foreign lender, is in the final stages of negotiations to create a joint venture with consumer lender Banco Bonsucesso SA, a source with knowledge of the situation said on Tuesday.

A joint venture should help Santander Brasil, the local unit of Spain's Banco Santander SA <SAN.MC>, to expand in payroll-deductible lending, said the source, who requested anonymity because the matter is private. Santander and Bonsucesso did not immediately comment.  The Pentagna Guimarães family, which founded Bonsucesso in 1992, has also helped the lender expand in lending for small- and mid-sized companies. Veja magazine's Radar column reported the deal early on Tuesday. The structure of the Santander Brasil-Bonsucesso venture is similar to one signed in 2012 between Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA> and payroll lender Banco BMG SA, according to the source. BMG was founded three decades ago by relatives of the Pentagna Guimarães family.
