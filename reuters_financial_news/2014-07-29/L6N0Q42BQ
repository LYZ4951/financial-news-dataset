LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Argentina's debt insurance costs hit six-week highs on Tuesday on worries that the country may go into default this week.

Argentina will meet the U.S. mediator in its battle with "holdout" debt investors for last-minute talks on Tuesday to avert a second default in less than 15 years. Investors are worried about Wednesday's deadline for Latin America's No. 3 economy to either pay the hold-out investors in full or cut a deal to stave off a default. [ID:nL2N0Q30EX] Argentina 5-year credit default swaps rose 27 basis points from Monday's close to a 6-week high of 1,899 bps, according to Markit.
