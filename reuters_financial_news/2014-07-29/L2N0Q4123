WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Homeownership in the United States hit a 19-year low in the  second quarter as financially squeezed Americans opted to rent, pointing to a sluggish housing market recovery.

The seasonally adjusted homeownership rate fell to 64.8 percent, the lowest level since the second quarter of 1995, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
