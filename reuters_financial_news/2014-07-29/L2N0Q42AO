NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - U.S. secondary loan prices have stopped rising in a more volatile environment. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's comments that high yield bond valuations looked stretched prompted investors to pull $2.4 billion from bond funds last week and geopolitical tensions are rising.

While strong demand from collateralized loan obligation (CLO) investors is continuing to insulate loan prices, as it did during an earlier period of weakness in April, loan traders are keeping a close eye on prices for signs of softening or further weakness.  Unease that the leveraged finance market had become frothy heated up in mid-July when Yellen highlighted lower-rated corporate debt as an area where "valuations appear stretched," in her semi-annual report to Congress.  High yield bond funds saw $4.1 billion of outflows in the last two weeks, with $1.7 billion preceding last week's $2.4 billion exodus.  Although leveraged loans faced harsher criticism, the U.S. central bank head cited a "marked deterioration" in loan underwriting standards, as loans have had a more muted reaction than bonds, with $413 million of outflows last week and mainly steady secondary prices.  Although secondary loan prices softened in some sessions the past week as high yield crossover accounts sold loan assets to meet redemptions, prices mostly held steady with average bids of 99.29 on July 28, slightly below a post-crisis peak of 99.34 on July 9.  "I do see a divergence of the high yield and loan markets," said Thomas Shandell, partner at GoldenTree Asset Management. "I do not see contagion."  Robust CLO issuance is the main driver of the divergence, banking sources said, as the high yield bond market has no counterpart for the structured vehicles that are the main buyers of leveraged loans in the primary and secondary markets.  The hot CLO market helped secondary loan prices to weather several weeks of back-to-back billion dollar-plus outflows from loan mutual funds in June. Average secondary bids strengthened after April's weakness and regained a post-crisis high by mid-June.  Secondary loan prices have survived outflows from bank mutual funds relatively unscathed and are currently weathering even heavy outflows from high yield bond funds, as they did last year in June and July during the so-called "taper tantrum".  Retail investors pulled $4.6 billion out of high yield bonds funds in the week ending June 5, 2013, amid fears of rising interest rates and duration risk as the Federal Reserve threatened to end its bond buying program, which was the largest-ever outflow for the asset class.  Investors followed that with $3.3 billion in outflows in the week ending June 12, 2013, and $3.12 billion in the week ending June 26. Those three weeks were three of the junk bond market's five worst weeks ever.  High yield bond prices dropped around 7 points during this cash exodus. Secondary loan prices saw some weakness during the same period, but it was small in comparison, with a drop of 50bp to 1 point in June 2013.  "For high yield bond outflows to have a material impact on loans, it would have to be sustained and pretty ugly," said a leveraged finance source.  High yield selling has yet to cross that line. Although leverage ratios have surpassed 2007 levels, loans are more compelling than bonds on a relative return basis, especially after Yellen's comments that interest rates could rise earlier than the market's expectation of mid-2015.  Secondary loan prices started to flatline in early July, seemingly fatigued by a continual upward trek that left little room for further advancement and left the primary market vulnerable to return-eroding repricings.
