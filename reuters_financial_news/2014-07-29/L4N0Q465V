July 29 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn cut his stake in Family Dollar Stores Inc <FDO.N>, a day after the company agreed to be bought by rival discount chain Dollar Tree Inc <DLTR.O> for $8.5 billion.

Icahn said he was "determined" to dispose part of his stake  rather than wait for the deal to close or for higher offers to emerge. Icahn reported a 6.03 percent stake on Tuesday, down from about 9.39 percent that made him the largest shareholder. (http://1.usa.gov/1lT2Qz6  )
