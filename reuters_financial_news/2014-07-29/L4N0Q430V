TAIPEI, July 29 (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank said on Tuesday it will auction T$20 billion ($666 million) in two-year negotiable certificate of deposits (NCD), more than doubled the original amount, to "meet asset allocation needs from financial institutions."

The auction amount on Aug. 8 will double from T$10 billion planned earlier, while the 364-day NCD remains as T$120 billion, the central bank said in a statement, without elaborating. Some analysts see the move as paving the way for the central bank to raise interest rates.
