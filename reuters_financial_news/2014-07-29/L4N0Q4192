TOKYO, July 28 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc <8604.T> on Tuesday said quarterly net profit fell 70 percent from a year earlier, missing analyst estimates, as a rally in Tokyo stocks last year gave way to a more cautious view of the country's recovery prospects.

Japan's biggest investment banking and brokerage group said its April-June net profit fell to 19.86 billion yen ($195 million) from 65.89 billion yen a year earlier. Analysts on average expected net profit of 26 billion yen, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.
