BOGOTA, July 29 (Reuters) - Colombia will publish concrete recommendations within two weeks on how to calculate minimum pension fund returns and diversify portfolios, the vice finance minister said on Tuesday, with a decree likely ready by the end of the year.

A commission of local and international experts has provided the ministry with proposals that will be presented to pension funds and the overall financial market for discussion over the next few months and then turned into law, Andres Restrepo told Reuters in an interview. Colombian pension fund investments are focused on fixed income and corporate shares, but the government wants to drive investment in a broader range of securities and overseas assets to spread risk and provide better returns for investors. "We have some super concrete recommendations on minimum returns," said Restrepo at his Bogota office. "I think the discussion will last two or three months before we have the project."  An increase in investment in overseas assets would likely boost demand for dollars in the market, reducing some pressure on the peso. It also could limit investment in local Treasury bonds, known as TES, historically the main pension fund asset. The peso has strengthened 4 percent so far this year. The diversification idea, born early last year, originally formed part of a package of economic measures announced by Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas to help weaken the currency by encouraging pension funds to increase dollar-denominated investments.  Restrepo said the pension fund initiative would help provide additional returns for savers.  Colombia's private pension fund system manages about $87 billion. The government has said previously that the rule change would not favor any asset class over another. "We continue to be very worried about the concentration of the portfolios," Restrepo said.
