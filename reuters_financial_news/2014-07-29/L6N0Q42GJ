LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Bank of Cyprus <BOC.CY> hopes to issue a covered bond of between 500 million euros and 1 billion euros in September, its chief executive John Hourican told Reuters on Tuesday.

"We'd like to be doing it (the covered bond) in late September," Hourican said in a telephone interview from Cyprus. "We're ready to go."  He added that the bank, which announced on Monday night that it had raised 1 billion euros of fresh equity, is targeting an interest rate in the "high threes" for the bond issue.  The capital issue and bond plans are the result of a wide-ranging review that Hourican instigated in March. The review also considered putting whether the bank should put its bad assets into a separately funded 'bad bank', but Hourican said that plan was "not feasible at this time". Investors who bought into the capital raise include famed U.S/ billionaire Wilbur Ross and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Hourican said that the new investors had a "three to five year" horizon on their Bank of Cyprus holding since there is a "lot of work to be done".
