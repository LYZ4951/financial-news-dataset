NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect to have to set aside more than another $5 billion to cover legal expenses, an estimate unchanged from earlier in the year despite a $4 billion addition to its legal reserves in the second quarter.

The bank's estimate came in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout the first half of 2014, Bank of America had set aside $10 billion to cover litigation-related expenses.  The bank has been negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve investigations into the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed bonds. [ID:nL4N0PR3H0]
