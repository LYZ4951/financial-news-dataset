MADRID, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro zone's biggest bank Santander <SAN.MC> is on Thursday expected to report a 31 percent jump in second-quarter net profit from a year ago as provisions against soured loans drop, offsetting a fall in lending revenue.

The lender, which makes just under half its profit in Latin America, was forecast to post net income of 1.373 billion euros ($1.84 billion) in the April-June period, according to the averaged predictions of 12 analysts polled by Reuters.  Net interest income (NII), or earnings on loans minus funding costs, was seen falling 5 percent from the second quarter a year ago, to 7.2 billion euros. NII should improve 2.5 percent quarter on quarter, however, helped by gains in its Spanish home market, analysts said.  Investors will be looking for an update on the evolution of Santander's key Brazilian unit, where an economic slowdown has dragged on results in recent quarters. Santander wants to buy out minority shareholders of Banco Santander Brasil <SANB11.SA> <SANB4.SA> to focus on turning the business around. Santander has been hit by volatile emerging market currencies in recent months, though the Brazilian real for instance strengthened compared to the first quarter, helping support the bank's earnings when converted into euros.  Analysts expected Santander's trading income to fall in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Many forecast provisions against soured debts would also fall.
