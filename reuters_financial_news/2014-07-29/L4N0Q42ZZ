SINGAPORE, July 29 (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank announced new proposals on Tuesday to regulate financial benchmarks, in the wake of a series of scandals around the world involving traders manipulating Libor and other key rates.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said it proposed to make the manipulation of financial benchmarks a civil and criminal offence. It will also force the administrators and submitters of systemically important benchmark rates to become licenced.
