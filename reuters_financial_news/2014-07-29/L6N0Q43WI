MADRID, July 29 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest bank BBVA <BBVA.MC> is expected to post a 39 percent fall in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, with earnings hit by unfavourable currency exchange rates in Latin America and after last year's results were boosted by one-off gains from disposals.

BBVA is seen reporting net income of 706 million euro ($947 million) in the April-June period, according to the averaged forecasts of 11 analysts polled by Reuters, compared to 1.15 billion euros in the same period a year ago. Weakening South American currencies are likely to hit BBVA, which operates in markets such as Venezuela. Its key Mexico division should hold up better. Net interest income, or earnings from loans net of funding costs, was seen falling 6 percent from a year ago to 3.5 billion euros in the second quarter. BBVA last year recorded close to 500 million euros in one-off gains in the second quarter from the sale of assets in Peru and Colombia, and without those the bank's bottom line will also be hit by comparison. Investors will also be looking at the bank's performance in its Spanish home market. BBVA recently said it was buying bailed-out Catalunya Banc, based in the northern Spanish region, to boost its presence in the country.
