July 29 (Reuters) - Aetna Inc <AET.N>, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Tuesday that its second-quarter profit rose, helped by the acquisition of Medicare and Medicaid provider Coventry last year.

Aetna reported net income of $549 million, or $1.52 per share, up from $536 million, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier.
