July 29 (Reuters) - Insurance and reinsurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc <JLT.L> reported a 15 rise in underlying pretax profit but said it was cautious for the rest of the year due to a marked decline in rates and a stronger pound.

Underlying pretax profit rose to 107.4 million pounds ($182.4 million) in the six months ended June 30 from 93.1 million pounds a year earlier, helped by its Towers Watson Re unit. Total revenue rose 15 percent to 559.6 million pounds.
