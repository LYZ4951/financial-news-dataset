SEOUL, July 29 (Reuters) - South Korean shares climbed to three-year highs on Tuesday on risk demand fuelled by a rally in Chinese markets and hope for more stimulus policies onshore and abroad.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.6 percent at 2,061.97 points in their third straight session of gains after trading at an intraday high not seen since August 2011. Foreign investors bought a net 356.0 billion won ($347.59 million) worth of local shares in their 11th straight session of buying. The South Korean won <KRW=> also rose on Tuesday, supported by the local stock market's performance and on central bank data that showed South Korea posted a 37th month of current account surpluses on a seasonally adjusted basis in June. [ID:nL4N0Q35H2] The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,024.4 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.2 percent from Monday's close at 1,026.3.
