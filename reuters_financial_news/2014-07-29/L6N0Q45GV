MILAN, July 29 (Reuters) - Italy's Poste Italiane will invest 65 million euros ($87 million) into troubled flagship carrier Alitalia as part of a deal with banks meant to pave the way for a tie-up with Etihad Airways, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.

State-owned Poste already paid 75 million euros for a 20 percent stake in Alitalia last year as part of a 500 million euro government-engineered rescue to keep its planes flying while it searched for a foreign partner to help revamp its ailing network.  Abu Dhabi's Etihad plans to buy 49 percent of Alitalia in a deal Rome hopes will make the loss-making carrier profitable. Poste Italiane will invest the money into a separate vehicle rather than directly into the airline, allowing it to avoid taking on Alitalia's debt and other liabilities - a condition it insisted on for agreeing to any additional support.  "The Poste will invest 65 million euros in Alitalia, but via a mid-company," one of the sources told Reuters.  The Poste declined to comment, after saying in a statement earlier on Tuesday it had reached a deal in principle with the banks, including Italy's top two lenders Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI> which are also key Alitalia shareholders. It said technical details still needed to be finalised.
