MADRID, July 29 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Popular <POP.MC> is expected to post a near 8 percent drop in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, as the bank's lending revenues fall compared to a year ago and provisions against soured debts stay high.

The lender, Spain's sixth biggest by market value, was seen reporting a 61-million-euro ($82 million) profit for the April-June period, according to the averaged forecasts of 10 analysts polled by Reuters. Popular's net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on loans minus funding costs, was expected to fall 2.5 percent in the second quarter from a year ago to 561 million euros, contrasting with peers such as Sabadell <SABE.MC> or Caixabank <CABK.MC> which reported rises. However, Popular should see a 2 percent improvement in NII compared to the first quarter of 2014, reversing three straight quarters of drops as it too starts to benefit from falling deposit costs. The bank is expected to book several one-off gains in the second quarter from disposals, including the sale of its depositary and custody business, though several analysts believed it would set those funds aside in provisions against troubled loans. Some see provisions growing in the quarter from a year ago as Popular continues to clean-up its balance sheet ahead of Europe-wide health checks this year.
