EDINBURGH, July 29 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, with encouraging corporate results giving the stock market a boost to recoup the previous session's losses.

French telecom firm Orange <ORAN.PA> rose 2 percent after it confirmed its annual profit target and managed to stabilise its margins in the second quarter.  The gains fuelled a 0.4 percent rise for the sector <.SXKP>, which was the best performer in Europe. Parts maker GKN <GKN.L> rose 5.1 percent as growth in its car business offset currency headwinds, while Germany's Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> and Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> both rose after posting profits that beat consensus forecasts. [ID:nL6N0Q41EX][ID:nWEB00QFK] [ID:nL6N0Q40WC] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up 0.3 percent at 1,373.28 points by 0709 GMT, after having fallen 0.2 percent on Monday.
