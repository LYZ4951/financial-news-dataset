BEIJING, July 29 (Reuters) - A Chinese regulator said on Tuesday it is conducting an anti-monopoly investigation into Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> because the firm has not fully disclosed information about its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office application.

China's State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC) is investigating a Microsoft vice president and senior managers, and has made copies of the firm's financial statements and contracts, the SAIC said on its website.
