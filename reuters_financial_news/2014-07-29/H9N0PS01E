HONG KONG, July 29 (Reuters) - China shares finished at their highest this year on Tuesday, with turnover strong as investor confidence improved after recent encouraging data and growth-friendly policies.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.2 percent at 2,183.19 points, extending its winning streak to six days, the longest since August 2013. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 0.3 percent, in its eighth daily gain in a row.  Top index boost Bank of Communications <601328.SS> spiked another 6.6 percent following a 9.9 percent jump the previous day. The country's fifth-largest lender said late on Monday it was studying a plan to sell stakes to private investors under a government reform aimed at letting private capital play a bigger role in the economy.
