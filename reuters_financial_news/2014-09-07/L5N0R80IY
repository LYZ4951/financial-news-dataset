DUBAI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Dubai's bourse underperformed the region on Sunday as investors started cashing out in order to take part in the upcoming initial public offering of Emaar Properties' <EMAR.DU> malls unit, while most other markets edged up.

Dubai's index <.DFMGI> slid 1.7 percent as Emaar fell 1.3 percent. The developer on Sunday announced more details of its malls unit's initial public offer, which Emaar said had a net asset value of 33.2 billion dirhams ($9 billion). Subscription will open on September 14. [ID:nL5N0R8025] "I think overall this is due to the preparation for the Emaar Malls IPO," said Ali Adou, portfolio manager at The National Investor in Abu Dhabi. "There's a pressure on the market to exit (other stocks) and participate in the offer." The offer would be one of the largest equity sales in the Middle East since 2008 and Emaar has said it would allocate part of it towards retail investors who dominate Dubai's stock market. Qatar's bourse <.QSI> fell 0.7 percent after touching an all-time intraday high of 14,053 points and stocks that had led the uptrend became the main drags. Qatar National Bank <QNBK.QA> fell 1.8 percent and Industries Qatar <IQCD.QA> slid 2.1 percent. Abu Dhabi's bourse <.ADI> rose 0.4 percent. The main supports were First Gulf Bank <FGB.AD>, Etisalat <ETEL.AD> and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank <ADCB.AD> which climbed 1.9, 0.4 and 1.2 percent respectively. Shares in Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA) <TAQA.AD> fell 2.5 percent. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last Thursday that the company may sell assets this year and has picked two international advisers for a possible sale.
