May 8 (Reuters) - Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd NV <DLL.AS> said new mortgages more than tripled in the first quarter, taking the sting off a 5 percent decline in gross written premiums during the period.

New mortgages rose to 380 million euros ($529.06 million) in the three months ended March 31 from 114 million euros a year earlier. [ID:nHUG7R4dPC]
