SYDNEY, May 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares are expected to open on a tentative footing  on Friday after a flat finish on Wall Street, with investors likely to remain cautious ahead of China inflation data and a quarterly policy statement from the Reserve Bank of Australia.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 1 point to 5,450, a 17 point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 41 points on Thursday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 0.8 percent to 5,156.9 in early trade. * U.S. stocks were mixed with gains in internet stocks offset by losses in energy and utility sectors. * Nickel hit its strongest levels in more than two years as industrial consumers scrambled to secure supplies and speculators extended their buying spree after Vale halted its Goro nickel operations in New Caledonia. * Shares of Envestra <ENV.AX> could rise after companies controlled by Li Ka-shing launched an unsolicited $1.8 billion takeover offer. This trumps an earlier offer from Australian Pipeline Ltd <APA.AX> which already owns a third of Envestra. [ID:nL3N0NU7DB] * China inflation data (CPI & PPI) will be released around 0130 GMT -- any unexpected acceleration in price pressure could be negative for market sentiment. China is Australia's biggest export market. * The Reserve Bank of Australia quarterly policy statement is due at 0130GMT, with markets keeping an eye on inflation and growth forecasts.----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2238 GMT ------------  INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG  S&P 500 <.SPX>   1875.63 -0.14%-2.580  USD/JPY <JPY=>   101.63  -0.02%-0.020  10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.6107  -- 0.000  SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1289.76  0.06% 0.760  US CRUDE<CLc1>   100.27   0.01% 0.010  DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16550.97 0.20% 32.43  ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  141.54   0.28%  0.39  -------------------------------------------------------------* Wall St ends mostly lower; Nasdaq down for 3rd session [.N]   * U.S. crude falls on technical trade/Ukraine conflict  [O/R]   * Gold edges up as investors digest Yellen comments[GOL/]   * Nickel soars to two-year peak on Goro mine halt, shortages [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB]   (Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471  4234) DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
