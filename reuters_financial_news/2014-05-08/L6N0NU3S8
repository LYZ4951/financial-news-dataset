MADRID, May 8 (Reuters) - Spanish banks got a bigger capital boost than previously announced from a change in the treatment of their so-called deferred tax assets (DTAs), which under new global banking rules are discounted from capital bases.

The lenders can convert 40.8 billion euros ($57 billion) out of the 68 billion euros in net DTAS they had at the end of 2013 into state-backed tax credits, which will help them preserve them as capital, the Bank of Spain said in a report on Thursday.
