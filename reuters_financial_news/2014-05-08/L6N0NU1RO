NAIROBI, May 8 (Reuters) - Kenyan lender Diamond Trust Bank's <DTK.NR> pretax profit rose 20 percent to 2.07 billion shillings ($23.78 million) in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2013, helped by growth in net interest income.

The bank's net interest income - total interest minus interest expenses - rose to 3.01 billion shillings from 2.48 billion shillings, helped by increased lending to customers. Net loans and advances to customers rose 27 percent to 114.97 billion shillings.
