WARSAW, May 8 (Reuters) - Polish mid-tier lender Alior Bank <ALRR.WA> may increase its 2014 profit by around 50 percent from last year's 228 million zlotys ($75.75 million), as expected by analysts, the bank's CEO Wojciech Sobieraj said on Thursday.

"This is a very big challenge, but possible to achieve," Sobieraj told Reuters in an interview when asked about analysts' expectations concerning 2014 net profit. He also said he would not expect any further share sales by Italian Carlo Tassara in the near future, after the investor sold a 4.7 percent chunk in Alior Bank for $86 million in April.
