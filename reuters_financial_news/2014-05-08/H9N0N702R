BEIJING, May 8 (Reuters) - Shanghai shares edged up on Thursday as investors hoped that authorities will unveil stimulus measures to keep the pace of economic growth from slowing.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.3 percent at 2015.27 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings slipped 0.1 percent. Speculation that government support for the economy might be on the way helped property and other some stocks. Analysts said that Chinese media reports interpreted comments by the People's Bank of China on Tuesday as indicating the economy may be at greater risk of slowing, heightening investor hopes of stimulus.
