MUMBAI, May 8 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India is likely to issue guidelines for issuance of "on-tap" bank licences in 2014/15, RBI Deputy R. Gandhi said on Thursday, a month after the central bank granted two preliminary licences to set up new banks.

Alongside, the RBI is also expected to issue guidelines on differentiated bank licences in the current financial year, Gandhi said. On-tap licensing means that the RBI window for granting banking licences will be open through the year.
