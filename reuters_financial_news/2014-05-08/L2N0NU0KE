WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - Government-controlled mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> said on Thursday it would send the U.S. Treasury a dividend of $4.5 billion after posting a tenth straight quarterly profit.

Once it has made the latest payment, it will have returned $86.3 billion to taxpayers in return for the $71.3 billion in aid it received after being placed under the government's wing at the height of the financial crisis.
