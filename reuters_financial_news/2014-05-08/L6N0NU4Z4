ZURICH, May 8 (Reuters) - An influential advisory group has encouraged Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> shareholders to vote against plans to issue new shares for staff bonuses ahead of the Swiss bank's annual general meeting on Friday.

The U.S.-based ISS opposes the Zurich-based lender's request to more than treble its conditional capital to 1.6 million Swiss francs ($1.8 million), it wrote in a recommendation to Credit Suisse shareholders. The group hopes to build on the near-25 percent support it helped drum up against a similar initiative last year. ISS objects to the 7.8 percent of share capital the equity rewards would comprise of if the allocation were ratified, as well as a lack of performance targets in place to earn the payouts. Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-largest lender, has come under scrutiny as it faces a possible $1 billion-plus fine from the U.S. Justice Department for helping Americans evade U.S. taxes and criticism for not shrinking its investment bank enough. [ID:nL2N0NR1VQ] ISS supported the overall pay plan, which is among other proposals that will be put to shareholders. The plan gives Chief Executive Brady Dougan a 26 percent pay rise, to 9.8 million francs.Other shareholder groups including Swiss-based Ethos, Actares and ZCapital have recommended investors vote down Credit Suisse compensation policies entirely. The compensation vote is non-binding, though it will be from next year if a proposed amendment is ratified at the AGM. Credit Suisse declined to comment.
