WILMINGTON, Del, May 8 (Reuters) - A bankruptcy judge on Thursday ruled to subordinate part of Charles Ergen's $1 billion loan debt claim in the bankruptcy wireless venture LightSquared.

Ergen, who is also chairman of Dish Network Corp <DISH.O>, is LightSquared's largest creditor. LightSquared had accused Ergen of acquiring his debt surreptitiously, with an eye toward setting the stage for a Dish takeover, and had asked Judge Shelley Chapman to wipe out the claim or subordinate it below claims of other creditors. Judge Shelley Chapman, reading her decision from the bench at a hearing on Thursday, said the claim should be subordinated in an amount to be determined.
