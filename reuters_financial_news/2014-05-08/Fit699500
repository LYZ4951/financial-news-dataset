May 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says the rating migration trend of EMEA financial and non-financial corporate bonds may turn positive by year-end as the European economic recovery takes hold. The ratio of bond upgrades to downgrades improved 14% in 1Q14, continuing the narrowing negative bias seen throughout 2013, after having been entrenched in a negative rating migration trend since  2007. The main risk to a more benign rating trend development lies with the banking  segment. Many EU banks face rating headwinds due to the weakening of sovereign  support under the EU's Bank Recovery & Resolution Directive. Issuers domiciled in troubled GIIPS nations saw their net rating activity leap  into positive territory in 1Q14, outperforming the broader, negative bias, due  mainly to a collapse in downgrade volume as upgrades set a five-quarter high.  Total issuance rose 9% in the first quarter, compared with 1Q13, buoyed by a 16%  boost in new volume from issuers in the eurozone as sovereign ratings and  outlooks received a boost and sovereign benchmark yields tumbled to multi-year  or record lows. Entities in GIIPS nations ramped up issuance by 33%, led by  Italian issuers, which supplied almost 40% of their entire 2013 bond issuance  volume. Financials boosted issuance by 12%, outpacing non-financials by 6pp, as Italian  banks doubled their new bond supply from a year earlier. The move contrasts with  ongoing deleveraging pressures faced by the sector, and may reflect a release of  pent-up supply as markets grow more comfortable with Italian and Spanish bank  risk, coupled with positive spill-overs from emerging market (EM) volatility  through much of the quarter. Coupons on new issues dropped below 4% in 1Q14, and issuers were able to extend  maturities and boost the share of lower-rated bonds amid keen investor demand  for an additional pick-up in yield. The share of bonds with maturities of 10  years or more rose to 31% - the highest level since 2006 - as the portion of  lower-rated bonds also increased.  Refinancing in the year to date is 5pp higher, at 42%, than at the same period  last year due to a 7% decline in maturities and marginally higher issuance.  Financials issued bonds amounting to one-third of their 2014 bond maturities in  the year through April, while non-financials have already refinanced 81% of  maturities. European high-yield (EHY) issuance grew 9% in 1Q14 and the market remained open  amid EM volatility, as yields on bonds from non-financials fell below 4% for the  first time. The GIIPS-uplift theme was also evident, facilitating the surge in  new bond supply as banks remain cautious on their lending. However, concerns  continue to mount over shrinking risk premia in EHY as investors accept ever  declining yields with increasingly issuer-friendly terms.
