STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Swedish private equity firm Ratos <RATOb.ST> posted first quarter pretax loss on Thursday, sending its shares down sharply, but said it had seen increased market activity for many of its holdings in the second half of the quarter.

Ratos said it expected a more active transaction market in 2014 than in 2013 and kept its outlook for increasing profits in its holdings this year. "From about mid-February market activity steadily increased in several holdings with increasingly positive signals from customers and rising order bookings in several cases," Ratos CEO Susanna Campbell said in the report. Ratos fell 5.6 percent at 0820 GMT compared to a 0.5 percent rise in the Stockholm OMXS All Share Index.   DAVID HALLDEN, UBS "What stands out on the negative side is that net asset value came down about 7 percent quarter on quarter, but that's not a major issue, we think." "What's important here is that there is an underlying recovery in the holdings and that the exit market is strong."  MAGNUS RAMAN, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS"A disappointment on revenue and profits stands in one corner against their comments about an improved trend in the second part of Q1 and continued positive development in April in the other corner."
