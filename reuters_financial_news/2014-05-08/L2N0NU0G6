WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - Government-controlled mortgage finance firm Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> said on Thursday it would send the U.S. Treasury a dividend of $5.7 billion after posting a ninth straight quarterly profit.

Once it has made the latest payment in June, it will have returned $126.8 billion to taxpayers in return for the $116.1 billion in taxpayer aid it received after being placed under the government's wing at the height of the financial crisis.
