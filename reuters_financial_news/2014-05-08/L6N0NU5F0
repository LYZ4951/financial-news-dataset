NAIROBI, May 8 (Reuters) - Kenya's shilling is expected to weaken against the dollar next week as local firms pay dividends to foreign investors, while Zambia's currency should remain under pressure after falling copper prices pushed it to historic lows.

But west of the continent, Nigeria's naira will likely strengthen, buoyed by foreign inflows into the debt market and export receipts from oil firms.  KENYA By 1440 GMT, the Kenyan shilling <KES=> was quoted at 87.10/87.20 to the dollar, compared with last Thursday's close of 86.80/90. Traders expected the currency to tread a 86.80 to 87.50 range in the next few days, with the risk tilted towards a weaker tone. "This is the month where dividends are paid out," a senior trader at one commercial bank said. But intervention by the central bank to mop up excess liquidity in the local money market should support the shilling,  another trader said.  UGANDA Uganda's shilling <UGX=> was seen in a stable range in the coming week, although some pressure could arise from dollar demand in the energy and manufacturing sectors. Commercial banks quoted the currency of Africa's largest coffee exporter at 2,513/2,523, a touch stronger than its close at 2,515/2,525 last week. "The shilling is unlikely to break out of the 2,515-2,530 range but if the small demand we are seeing persists, some minimum depreciation bias may come through," said Faisal Bukenya, head of market making at Barclays Bank. The local currency has been largely stable in the year to date, but traders see pressure in the medium term from subdued economic growth, after the central bank cut 2013/14 growth projections. [ID:nL6N0NO1IW]  ZAMBIA Market watchers expect Zambia's kwacha <ZMW=> to remain on the back foot against the dollar, after weak copper prices pushed the currency of Africa's second-largest producer of the metal to all time lows this week. The kwacha eased to 6.4850/6.5050 per dollar on Thursday, after it climbed to as high as 6.2450 last week. "The kwacha is likely to depreciate further. It should trade in the range 6.550/6.650 due to tight dollar liquidity," said a local trader. Zambia in March lifted a ban on the use of dollars for domestic transactions  to ease pressure on the kwacha, but traders say this policy will only provide temporary relief.  GHANA Market watchers expected Ghana's cedi <GHS=>, which has which has slumped 22 percent against the greenback since January, to lose further ground next week. "There is still some significant real dollar demand out there and as such the local currency should continue to weaken, albeit at a slower pace," a Barclays Bank Ghana analyst said. "We expect dollar/cedi to reach 2.8900 early next week and close the week around 2.9100." In a bid to stem the cedi's depreciation, the Bank of Ghana earlier this year adopted a string of measures, including tightening exchange controls and raising reserve requirements. Analysts say the measures have taken some of the heat off the currency, but are not enough to dent a heavy backlog of dollar demand.  NIGERIA The naira <NGN=> could be the out-performer among African currencies next week, with offshore investors expected to buy local debt while oil firms are expected to remit export proceeds. The local unit was last trading at 160.90 to the dollar, firmer than Wednesday's close at 161.80.
