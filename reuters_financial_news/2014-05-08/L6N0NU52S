AMMAN, May 8 (Reuters) - Jordan's foreign exchange reserves stood at $12.6 billion at end of March, a five percent rise from the end of last year as they continue an upward trend from healthy capital inflows and a improved economic outlook, central bank data released on Thursday showed.

Bankers say several billion dollars of Gulf and other foreign grants since early last year to help shore up the aid dependent economy and mitigate the impact of over 600,000 refugees from the Syrian crisis have helped almost double foreign reserves. The build-up has reversed a downward trend in foreign reserves when they plunged to low of $6.6 billion in 2012 after a wave of Arab unrest that led to a drop in foreign investments and increased capital outflows by jittery depositors. Bankers and economists say that alongside more outside grants, the steady rise in foreign reserves was helped by macro economic stability and more business confidence as the kingdom  makes progress in implementing an IMF standby agreement to advance structural reforms. Cushioned by the healthy build-up in foreign reserves, the central bank has since last year begun to reduce interest rates, easing a tight monetary policy when social unrest in the country forced the bank to raise rates to guard against capital flight.
