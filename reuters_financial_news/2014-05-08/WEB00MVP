FRANKFURT, May 8 (Reuters) - German reinsurer Munich Re <MUVGn.DE> reported a 4.6 percent drop in net profit in the first quarter, as premium income fell amid a broad-based market decline in reinsurance prices.

Quarterly net profit after minorities fell to 919 million euros ($1.28 billion) from 963 million a year earlier, the world's largest reinsurer said in a statement. Munich Re reiterated its target of earning net profit of 3 billion in the full year and the quarterly result was slightly better than an preliminary report by chief executive Nikolaus von Bomhard, who told a shareholder meeting on April 30 that it would be around 900 million euros.
