SAO PAULO, May 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's Cetip SA Mercados Organizados <CTIP3.SA> likely had faster-growing first-quarter net income than rival exchange BM&FBovespa SA, a sign that the nation's largest securities clearinghouse is curbing exposure to the impact of flagging capital markets.

Both Cetip and BM&FBovespa <BVMF3.SA>, the nation's sole listed financial bourses, unveil results late on Thursday. Transaction volumes were weak in the quarter, with new products seen playing a role in the future, the poll showed. In the case of Cetip, operating numbers probably showed clearing and custody activities performed well despite a tumble in debt offerings. While its liens unit had small volume growth, a one-time price hike in January helped partially offset declining revenue, the poll found. Net income at the Sao Paulo-based company probably reached a record-high 98 million reais ($44 million) in the quarter, up 21.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the average of four estimates in the poll. Compared with the prior three months, profit was up 1.6 percent, the poll showed. On an annual basis, net revenue likely soared 16 percent, while general expenses were up 3.3 percent, the poll found. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational performance known as EBITDA, rose 12.1 percent on an annual basis, to 168 million reais. "Those numbers are strong and, if confirmed, could lead the market consensus to adjust its estimates for Cetip upward," Alexandre Spada, an analyst with Itau BBA, said in a note.  Performance of BM&FBovespa remained linked to market volatility, while that of Cetip is growing increasingly tied to lending and car sales, because of liens it sells, said Carlos Macedo, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The results are unlikely to trigger sharp movements in shares of both companies, analysts in the poll noted. BM&FBovespa showed a significant recovery on a quarter-on-quarter basis, according to the poll, but annual results likely will come in weak. Net income fell 4.3 percent from a year earlier to an average 256 million reais, the poll of four analysts said. Profit probably rose 41 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Net revenue likely fell 5.8 percent to 491 million reais on an annual basis as volumes in the Bovespa equities and BM&F derivatives segments slumped. Expenses rose 7.8 percent in the period, while EBITDA slipped 5.8 percent, the poll showed. The following are estimates for first-quarter earnings at Cetip and BM&FBovespa.
