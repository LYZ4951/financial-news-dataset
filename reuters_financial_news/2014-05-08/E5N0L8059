SAO PAULO, May 8 (Reuters) - State-run lender Banco do Brasil SA <BBAS3.SA> is considering altering its dividend policy next year, Chief Financial Officer Ivan Monteiro said on Thursday.

"It is reasonable for that to be discussed for the 2015 budget," Monteiro said on a conference call with analysts to discuss first-quarter earnings. He added that the current 40 percent payout rate would be maintained for 2014.
