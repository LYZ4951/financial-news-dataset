BANGKOK, May 8 (Reuters) - CIMB Thai Bank <CIMBT.BK>, a unit of Malaysia's CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL>, has cut its 2014 loan growth target to 10-15 pct from 15-20 pct due to Thailand's weak economic outlook and the impact from political unrest.

The bank's loans grew only 1-2 percent in the first quarter and the loan growth should accelerate in the second half, driven by demand from large corporate clients, Chief Executive Subhak Siwaraksa told reporters on Thursday.
