The following are comments made by Chief Executive Rune Bjerke and Chief Financial Officer Bjoern Erik Naess during an earnings presentation:  CEO ABOUT GROWTH IN 2014: "We keep our growth ambitions but it shouldn't hit profitability. We had an annualised growth rate of 2.5 percent in the first quarter and we will do what we can to reach our target of 3-4 percent. "We see positive tendencies and there is high activity in all our segments. "In sum we see several more positive signs now than one quarter ago. "If we look at the activity of the last part of the quarter there is reason to believe we will crawl up to our planned level."  CEO ON MARGINS:  "Our target to reach stable volume weighted margins through the year is kept. "We have bigger flexibility on the funding side and there are no new signals after the rate adjustments we have seen, but competition is tough."  CEO ON LOAN LOSSES: "We say that the losses will be low in the quarters to come and significantly below normalised levels. "It looks very robust regarding our credit quality."  CEO ON BUILDING CAPITAL "We are well on track to build capital. We have delivered according to our plans and we are sure we will reach the new regulatory requirements in core capital of 13.5-14 percent. "We have built 60 billion Norwegian crowns ($10.16 billion) in new capital since the start of the financial crisis."   CEO ABOUT DIVIDEND:  "We have not said we are ahead of plans but we are in a good position to reach our targets. We have earlier said that we for a period will deviate from our long term dividend policy of paying out 50 percent of the net result. We have said a 25 percent pay-out is a minimum and that our ambition is to come back to 50 percent as fast as possible. It's definitively not the time now to predict anything new for 2014, but our ambition is to come back to 50 percent as fast as possible."  CFO: ON LOAN LOSSES   "We had group reversals (of losses) in shipping in Q1 and based on our calculations we will also have reversals at least in the second quarter. It reflects at better trend in the shipping market. "Dry bulk and tankers are improving while container shipping is the biggest challenge now. "Also, big international business customers contribute to the improved trend in loan losses."
