ABUJA, May 8 (Reuters) - Africa's biggest lender Standard Bank <SBKJ.J> aims to expand its existing operations in Nigeria to take advantage of retail and business banking opportunities and has no immediate acquisition plans, its group chief executive told Reuters.

Sim Tshabalala also said on Thursday the bank had not bid for Enterprise Bank, one of three banks held by state-owned Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).
