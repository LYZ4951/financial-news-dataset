STOCKHOLM, May 8 (Reuters) - Sweden's financial watchdog on Thursday outlined its roadmap for building up resilience among lenders ahead of any future crisis confirming it would raise mortgage risk weights and introduce a systemic risk buffer.

The Financial Supervisory Authority said it would give details of a planned countercyclical capital buffer for banks in the autumn. "On the whole, the information provided today describes a clear tightening of capital requirements for Swedish banks," the  said in a statement. The FSA said Swedbank <SWEDa.ST>, Nordea <NDA.ST>, SEB <SEBa.ST> and Handelsbanken <SHBa.ST> will have to hold a systemic risk buffer of 3 percent in core Tier 1 capital from the start of 2015 along with a further 2 percent as part of the so-called Pillar 2 requirement of new international rules. The FSA also confirmed that mortgage risk weights for banks will rise to 25 percent from 15 percent.
