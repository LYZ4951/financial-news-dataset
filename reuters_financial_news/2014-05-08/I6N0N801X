MILAN, May 8 (Reuters) - Italian banks repaid last month nearly 13 billion euros in longer-term European Central Bank funds though overall funding from the ECB remained broadly unchanged from a month earlier due to a larger take-up at short-term liquidity tenders.

Overall ECB funding to Italian banks stood at 210.5 billion euros ($293.1 billion) at the end of last month, against 211.05 billion euros at the end of March, Bank of Italy data showed on Thursday.
