WELLINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - New Zealand house price growth slowed marginally for a fifth consecutive month in April, with the market seeming to have taken bank lending restrictions and rising interest rates in its stride, the government property valuer said on Thursday.

Quotable Value's (QV) residential property index rose 8.4 percent in the year to April 30, compared with a 8.8 percent annual rate in March. The index is now 13 percent above the market's previous peak in late 2007, with activity perking up in the biggest city Auckland, which has been driving national figures. Limits on low deposit lending by retail banks, which were imposed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand last October, are seen to have cooled price growth and demand, especially with first home buyers. The central bank has started its long awaited tightening cycle with two 25 basis point rises since March taking the cash rate to 3 percent.
