May 8 (Reuters) - IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc <ICE.N>, the exchange and clearing house operator, on Thursday reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings due to income from new businesses.

Net income for the parent of the New York Stock Exchange rose to $262 million, or $2.27 a share, from $135 million a year ago, or $1.85 a share. Excluding $60 million in costs related to the acquisition and integration of NYSE Euronext, adjusted earnings were $2.60 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $2.58, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased to $932 million from $352 million a year ago, above expectations for $922.9 million. Financial results were driven by the addition of new businesses, growth in ICE's global agriculture complex and a record quarter for clearing of credit default swaps, Chief Financial Officer Scott Hill said.
