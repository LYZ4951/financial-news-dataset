WELLINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - New Zealand central bank restrictions on the amount banks can lend on low deposit home loans (LVR) will remain in place for the time being as they are seen cooling the housing market and taking pressure off interest rates, the Reserve Bank of NZ said on Friday.

"At this stage we consider the earliest date for beginning to remove LVRs is likely to be late in the year," said Reserve Bank of New Zealand Deputy Governor Grant Spencer. He said the housing shortage in key markets was still large but starting to ease, but the loan to value ratio limits were helping to lower the risks to the financial system.
