PARIS, May 8 (Reuters) - General Electric <GE.N>, which wants to buy Alstom's <ALSO.PA> energy businesses, is not in talks with Japanese conglomerate Toshiba Corp <6502.T> about the French company's power grid business, a GE France spokesman said on Thursday.

The Nikkei business daily said Toshiba would offer to buy Alstom's power grid unit if General Electric purchased the French firm's energy businesses. [ID:nL3N0NU2WX]
