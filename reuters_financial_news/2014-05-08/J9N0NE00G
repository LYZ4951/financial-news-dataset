JAKARTA, May 8 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank kept its key reference rate <BIPG> unchanged at 7.50 percent on Thursday, as widely expected, with pressures over inflation and a widening current-account deficit easing.

A Reuters poll of 15 analysts had projected the central bank would keep its policy rate unchanged at 7.50 percent for a sixth straight month. Between June and November, Bank Indonesia raised rates by a total of 175 basis points. The central bank also left the deposit facility rate, or FASBI, and lending facility rate at 5.75 percent and 7.50 percent, respectively.
