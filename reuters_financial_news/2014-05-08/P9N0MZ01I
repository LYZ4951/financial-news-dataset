MANILA, May 8 (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank left its overnight borrowing rate <PHCBIR=ECI> steady at a record low of 3.5 percent on Thursday, but raised banks' reserve requirements by 1 percentage point to dampen strong liquidity growth, as expected.

It also left the short-term special deposit account (SDA) rate (SDA) unchanged. Thirteen of 15 analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted the central bank would leave policy rates on hold for the 12th meeting in a row, as monetary authorities appeared focused on siphoning liquidity from the financial system that could stoke inflation. Two economists had forecast a 25-basis-point hike in the central bank's overnight borrowing rate. Eight of the 15 economists had predicted another 1 percentage point increase in banks' reserve requirement, following a similar move in late March. Three had forecast a 25 bps hike in the short-term SDA rate. The policy-making Monetary Board holds a rate-setting meeting every six weeks. It next meets on June 19.
