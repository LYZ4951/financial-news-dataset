BRUSSELS, May 8 (Reuters) - The euro zone's moderate recovery is continuing and inflationary pressures are subdued, the European Central Bank said on Thursday, pledging to keep interest rates low for an extended period of time.

"Incoming information continues to underline that the moderate recovery of the euro zone economy is proceeding," Draghi told a news conference after the ECB decided to keep its interest rates unchanged at 0.25 percent. He added that new projections would be ready at the ECB's June meeting.
