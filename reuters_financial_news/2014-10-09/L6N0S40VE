LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European shares bounced back from the previous session's two-month lows on Thursday on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for a longer period.

The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 1 percent at 1,332.10 points by 0705 GMT, after falling 0.8 percent in the previous session. The market was rallying following the release late on Wednesday of the minutes of the Fed's Sept. 16-17 meeting. The U.S. central bank expressed concern the rising dollar could slow a needed rebound in inflation and highlighted economic turmoil in Europe and Asia, another factor behind the Fed's stance towards keeping an accommodative policy for the near future.
