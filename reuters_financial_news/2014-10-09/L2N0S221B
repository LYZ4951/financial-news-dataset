WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The following are highlights of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on Thursday in Washington, where finance ministers, central bankers and other top officials are gathering.

WORLD BANK PRESIDENT JIM YONG KIM ON EBOLA "You have to stop these epidemics at the source. Trying to block your borders or isolating those countries somehow is not going to work. "If anybody...would like to make a contribution, they should do it now, not wait two or three weeks, because the price tag goes up every day that we delay."  ON ASIAN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT BANK "At the World Bank Group our enemy is poverty... There is such a need for more investment in infrastructure that any organization that's focused on investment in infrastructure to fight poverty is our friend."  IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRISTINE LAGARDE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY "The latest snapshot of the global economy looks uneasily familiar: a brittle, uneven recovery, with slower-than-expected growth and increasing downside risks." "A much higher premium needs to be put across the membership on policies aimed at decisively raising today's actual and tomorrow's potential growth."
