Oct 9 (Reuters) - Malaysian e-payment provider MOL Global Inc's <MOLG.O> stock fell as much as 35 percent in its U.S. debut, making it the weakest performer among six other companies' stocks that also went public on Thursday.

Majority owned by Malaysian billionaire Vincent Tan, MOL's offering raised about $169 million after its IPO size was slashed to 13.5 million American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from 19.5 million. Of the total ADSs offered, MOL sold about 7.5 million. The rest of the ADSs were sold by some of its shareholders. MOL's offering, the first U.S. IPO of a Malaysian company, was priced at $12.50 per ADS, the low-end of its expected price range of $12.50 to $14.50. MOL, also known as Money Online, is the largest e-payment enabler for online goods and services in Southeast Asia by payment volume, according to a Frost & Sullivan report. The company's IPO comes on the heels of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's <BABA.N> blockbuster debut in September. "They were hoping to fly on the wings of Alibaba and catch some excitement which did not happen," Francis Gaskins, research director at Equities.com said, adding that the underwriters mispriced the offering. MOL's shares opened at $10.75 and touched a low of $8.11, valuing the company at about $705 million. The stock never touched its IPO price till noon trade. Tan's stake in MOL would drop to 44.7 percent from 69.3 percent after the offering. Other notable investors include Sultan Ibrahim of the State of Johor with a stake of about 13 percent after the offering.
