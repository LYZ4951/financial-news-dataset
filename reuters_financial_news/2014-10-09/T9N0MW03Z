TOKYO, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Japan's Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance said on Thursday that it plans to keep trimming its domestic stock exposure for the fiscal year through March 2015 and that it will stick to its stance of keeping yen bond holdings at the core of its portfolio.

Aioi Nissay Dowa, which had 2.8 trillion yen ($25.96 billion) in assets as of end-March 2014, is the non-life insurance arm of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings <8725.T>, Japan's biggest property and casualty insurance group. Aioi Nissay Dowa sees yen bonds, which include government bonds and hedged foreign bonds, as the core of its assets, Kazuya Yoshioka, general manager at its investment planning department, told Reuters in an interview. Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> has risen roughly 5 percent since the start of the fiscal year in April, presenting a favourable opportunity for Aioi Nissay Dowa to reduce their stock holdings. "The market value of our stocks holdings increases as stock prices rise, so we have been trimming our holdings accordingly," Yoshioka said. The insurer said it holds about half of its assets in yen bonds and roughly 20 percent in domestic stocks, with the remainder in unhedged foreign bonds and trust funds.
