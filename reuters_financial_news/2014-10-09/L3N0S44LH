Oct 9 (Reuters) - Riverbed Technology Inc <RVBD.O> said it would review its alternatives and started a restructuring program to cut costs, three days after activist investor Elliott Management reaffirmed its offer to buy the network equipment maker.

The company's stock rose 3.5 percent to $18.72 in premarket trading on Thursday. The restructuring plan was aimed at reducing annual costs by $20 million to $25 million and improve operating margins by 1-2 percent, Riverbed said in a statement. [ID:nBw1Crk1da]
