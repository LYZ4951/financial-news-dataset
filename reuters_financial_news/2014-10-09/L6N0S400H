RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's government is considering easing reserve requirements for banks in the country to free up lending for infrastructure projects, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.

Brazil is trying to increase lending and investment in infrastructure projects to reinvigorate its economy, which slipped into a technical recession earlier this year.
