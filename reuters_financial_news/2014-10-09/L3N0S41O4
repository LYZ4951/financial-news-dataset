HONG KONG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Tianhe Chemicals Group <1619.HK> has had "minimal" impact on its business from a stock researcher's allegations that it had overstated its profits, Chief Executive Xuan Wei said on Thursday.

Tianhe has a longstanding business with companies including China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation <600028.SS>, French oil company Total SA <TOTF.PA> and others, which are comfortable doing business with it, Wei told a news conference.
