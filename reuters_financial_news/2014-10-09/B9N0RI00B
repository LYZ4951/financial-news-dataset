SHANGHAI, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Shares of China's Tianhe Chemicals Group <1619.HK> are set to open down 26.4 percent on Thursday after a month-long trading halt following a stock researcher's allegations that it had cooked its books.

Tianhe's stocks were set to open at HK$1.7 per share versus the last trading price of HKD2.31 per share on Sept. 2.  Anonymous Analytics, a stock researcher, accused Tianhe of overstating profits in its initial public offering prospectus ahead of its Hong Kong listing, sending shares down 5 percent on Sept. 2, before trading was suspended at the company's request.
