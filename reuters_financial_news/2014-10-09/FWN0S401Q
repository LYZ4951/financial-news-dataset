ZURICH, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's <DBKGn.DE> Swiss unit is participating in a U.S. tax programme for banks that may have helped wealthy Americans evade taxes through hidden offshore accounts, a spokeswoman for the Swiss unit said on Thursday.

"I can confirm that we are taking part in the U.S. programme," the spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday. Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that Deutsche Bank's Swiss unit had entered the U.S. self-reporting programme, citing people familiar with the matter.
