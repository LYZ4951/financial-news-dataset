NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Oct 8 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $30.2 billion to $1.083 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $10.3 billion to $1.038 trillion.
