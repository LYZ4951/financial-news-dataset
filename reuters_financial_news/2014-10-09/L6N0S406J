MOSCOW, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Thursday that it had conducted 17.66 billion roubles ($440 million) worth of forex interventions to defend the rouble on Oct. 7.

The central bank releases its interventions data with a two-day lag. The rouble <RUB=> has been sliding on falling oil prices and broad risk aversion towards Russia because of its role in the Ukraine crisis.
