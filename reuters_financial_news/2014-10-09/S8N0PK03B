LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Britain's finance ministry said it had appointed Bank of China, HSBC and Standard Chartered to help organize the first sale of British government debt denominated in China's renminbi currency.

Britain is hoping to be first Western government to issue an offshore renminbi bond as it deepens its financial links with the world's No.2 economy.
