MOSCOW, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has shifted the boundaries of its floating rouble corridor by 20 kopecks, the bank said on Thursday, following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline.

As of Oct. 8, the new corridor extended from 35.85 to 44.85 to a dollar euro basket <RUS=MCX>, compared with 35.65 to 44.65 previously.
