SYDNEY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Australian shares are expected to slump on Friday, as Wall Street ended sharply lower overnight on lingering concerns about the outlook for the global economy, while investors will also eye local mortgage lending data due later in the day.

Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> lost 1.1 percent to 5,221, a 75.7-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark jumped 1.1 percent on Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage gain since Aug. 12. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> lost 0.8 percent in early trade. * The S&P 500 posted its largest percentage decline in six months overnight on lingering concern about the strength of the global economy and its effect on corporate earnings.  * Iron ore for immediate delivery to China <.IO62-CNI=SI> slipped 0.3 percent to $79.80 a tonne on Wednesday.  * Copper and other base metals rebounded while gold rose to a two-week high. Iron ore has fallen more than 40 percent this year, hit hard by a glut in supply at a time of slower demand growth in China, which buys around two-thirds of the world's iron ore.  * Northern Star Resources Ltd <NST.AX> says Shaun Day has been appointed chief financial officer, effective from Oct. 13. [ID:nWNBS00RDQ] * Transurban Group <TCL.AX> says its toll revenue increased by 63.9 percent to $364.7 million for the September quarter.
