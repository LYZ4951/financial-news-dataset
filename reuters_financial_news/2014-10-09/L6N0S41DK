PARIS, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Transatlantic engine venture CFM International has begun flight testing of its LEAP-1C engine, which is being developed for China's new C919 jetliner, industry sources said on Thursday.

The move marks a milestone not only for Chinese planemaker Comac but also for Europe's Airbus <AIR.PA>, which plans to use a very similar version of CFM's new LEAP engine as one of the choices for its upgraded A320neo aircraft.
