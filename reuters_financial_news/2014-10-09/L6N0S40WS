AMSTERDAM, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd <DLL.AS> said on Thursday it has abandoned plans to sell its Belgian operations after talks with a potential buyer failed to materialise in a deal.

"The exclusive negotiations with a potential buyer did not result in agreement about the value and terms of a sale," Delta Lloyd said in a statement. It did not name the potential buyer. The Belgian operations, with 170,000 clients and assets worth roughly 6.9 billion euros ($8.8 billion), will stay within the Delta Lloyd group, it said.  The Dutch insurance sector, with six major competitors, is ripe for consolidation after a wave of bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis.
