SHANGHAI, Oct 9 (Reuters) - China shares retreated on Thursday as investors booked profits after a key index hit a 20-month high the previous day and ahead of major economic data next week.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> fell 0.6 percent to 2,369.3043 points by midday, off its highest level since February 2013 hit on Wednesday. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings dropped 0.6 percent. The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> gained 0.9 percent to 23,477.84 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 0.7 percent. "The main reason behind the fall is profit-taking by many institutions," said Tian Weidong, head of research at Kaiyuan Securities in the city of Xi'an. He also said that market participants were turning cautious ahead of a slew of Chinese economic data for September, including trade and inflation figures, due next week. The financial sector fell, with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS> sliding 0.6 percent and China Merchants Securities Co <600999.SS> dropping 2 percent. Hong Kong indexes gained in response to the rise in U.S. stocks after the Federal Reserve reassured investors that the first interest rate increase would not come before the economy could support it.
