FRANKFURT, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank spelt out its plans again on Thursday to inject hundreds of billions of euros in fresh cheap money to shore up the euro zone's flagging economy and said more would be done if needed.

In its monthly bulletin, which provides a porthole into ECB thinking, the central bank recapped on its strategy to first buy covered bonds, safe investments often backed by property. Later this year, it will buy repackaged debt known as asset backed securities (ABS). This includes debt with a 'junk' credit rating. The bulletin's opening statement was virtually identical to its recent statement delivered by ECB President Mario Draghi on Oct 2, when the ECB laid out its plans. "The new measures will support specific market segments that play a key role in the financing of the economy," the ECB said in the monthly report.  "Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate." Below is a list of articles and special sections the bulletin contains.   * The external environment of the euro area   * The targeted longer-term refinancing operationof September 2014  "The reduction in lenders' funding costs achieved through  this first (TLTRO) operation should be passed on to their borrowers and is thus likely to result in easier financing conditions for the private sector," the report said.  * Developments in consumer gas prices in the euro area "Looking ahead, the recent decline in oil prices, moderate demand growth for natural gas and the growing importance of spot markets suggest subdued pressures on wholesale natural gas  prices. However, tensions between the EU and Russia over the situation in Ukraine are a source of upward risks."  * What lies behind the recent decline in economic sentiment? "The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. In particular, the recent weakening in the euro area's growth momentum, alongside heightened geopolitical risks, could dampen confidence and, in particular, private investment. In addition, insufficient progress in structural reforms in euro area countries constitutes a key downward risk to the economic outlook," the report said.  * The impact of the economic crisis on euro area labour markets  * The assessment of fiscal effort
