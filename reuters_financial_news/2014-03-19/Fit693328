March 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Steps taken by the Taiwanese authorities to cool the  island's bubbling property market will continue to deter aggressive risk-taking  in mortgage lending by banks, Fitch Ratings says in a new report. The measures have slowed the growth in mortgage lending on the island, and Fitch  expects mortgage lending growth to stagnate over 2014-2015.  The main macro-prudential measure was to assign a 100% risk weighting on  non-owner occupied home mortgages. As a result, Taiwanese banks' risk weightings  for their home mortgage portfolios generally range from 50% to 80%, compared  with 10%-20% for banks in developed markets in the Asia-Pacific that practice  the Internal Ratings-Based Approach to credit risk. However, Taiwanese banks are less well-capitalised - even factoring the impact  of their higher risk weightings for home mortgages - and are more highly  leveraged than their peers in the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwanese banks'  equity-to-asset ratio was ranked the lowest in the region, along with China, at  about 6.5% at end-1H13. The relatively high leverage is the most visible  weakness for the ratings on Taiwanese banks and will exert heavy influence on  their Viability Ratings.
