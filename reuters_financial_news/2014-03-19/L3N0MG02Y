SEOUL, March 19 (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea's governor-nominee Lee Ju-yeol, a former senior deputy governor at the central bank, is expected to be appointed by President Park Geun-hye after Wednesday's parliamentary hearing.

Lee will be questioned on a range of key issues, including South Korea's household debt, inflation and future monetary policy at the central bank. Once appointed, Lee will take office April 1. Following are key remarks from Lee at the hearing, translated by Reuters:  GLOBAL ECONOMY: "Advanced economies seem to be shedding the shock of global financial crises, whereas now emerging economies are losing steam."  DOMESTIC ECONOMY: "A decline in the workforce and investments by companies have dulled growth. South Koreans are concerned whether the economy will turn into one similar to Japan's economy." "Household debt not only pressures growth but it is narrowing the extent of the central bank's monetary policy."  POLICY: "I think there was a problem with communication with markets when the central bank lowered rates in May 2013."  INFLATION:
