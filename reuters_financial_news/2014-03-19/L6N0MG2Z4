OSLO, March 19 (Reuters) - Aker Philadelphia Shipyard ASA <AKPS.OL> President and CEO Kristian Roekke, the son of the group's largest shareholder, has been nominated as the firm's executive chairman and will hand over his CEO duties at the end of the year, the firm said.

Kristian Roekke will remain in a full-time role with the firm until Dec 31, then hand over to Steinar Nerboevik before taking on another role within the Aker group, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Aker Philadelphia, which builds vessels for the U.S. market,  is a part of the Aker <AKER.OL> conglomerate, which includes controlling stakes in oil service group Aker Solutions <AKSO.OL>, oil producer Det norske <DETNOR.OL> and U.S. shipper American Shipping <AMSCA.OL>. The group is controlled by the Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, one of Norway's richest men. Aker did not say what position Kristian Roekke would take in the group and spokesman Atle Kigen said appointing him to head Aker Solutions "has not been in our thoughts". Aker Solutions has been seeking a new CEO for months and Oeyvind Eriksen, considered to be Kjell Inge Roekke's right hand man, has been running both Aker and Aker Solutions on an interim basis. Kristian Roekke, 30, has been with Aker Philadelphia since 2007 and has been the firm's CEO since April 2011. The firm has experienced a boom over the past several years as the U.S. shale gas boom has sharply increased demand for vessels.
