MILAN, March 19 (Reuters) - Shares in bailed-out Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> turned negative shortly after the open on Wednesday, erasing earlier gains of as much as 3 percent, a day after its debt-laden top investor sold a 12 percent stake in the bank.

The Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena said on Tuesday it had sold a 12 percent stake in the Tuscan bank on the market and would use proceeds to repay its large debt.
