STOCKHOLM, March 19 (Reuters) - Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Wednesday the government would look at providing bilateral aid to Ukraine within the framework of the International Monetary Fund.

"We will initiate, in the Nordic-Baltic group within the IMF, a process to consider giving bilateral aid to Ukraine in the same way we did with Latvia, Ireland and Iceland," Borg told reporters at a banking seminar. He provided no further details about how much aid could be offered or when. Russian forces took control of the Crimea peninsula in late February following the toppling of Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich by protesters angered at his decision to spurn a trade deal with the European Union and seek closer ties with Russia.
