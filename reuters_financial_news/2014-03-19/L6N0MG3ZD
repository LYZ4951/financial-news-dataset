MILAN, March 19 (Reuters) - Italy is considering issuing a new 15-year bond, two market sources told Reuters on Wednesday, adding its launch was not imminent.

"The Treasury is weighing up whether to launch a new 15-year bond. It's not imminent but they're seriously considering it," one source said, adding the current 15-year benchmark had reached a decent outstanding size and the market situation was good. At auction last week, the Treasury tapped the September 2028 bond, fetching a record low yield of 3.85 percent. The sale brought the bond's oustanding amount above 18 billion euros. The bond <IT4889033=TWEB> is expensive on the secondary market trading well above par at around 110. Italy last issued a new 15-year maturity in January 2013. The Treasury declined to comment. A second market source said the Treasury was generally ready "to pull a new 15-year bond out of its drawer but not just yet." The source said that the longer maturity required "more careful handling" than a benchmark 10-year one. Italy sold a new 10-year inflation-linked bond last week through a syndicate of banks for 4.5 billion euros. [nI6N0M400E] Italy is expected to issue a new inflation-linked bond aimed at small investors over the next few weeks and the Treasury may want to wait until after that to launch the new 15-year line. Italy is trying to extend the average life of its 1.8 trillion euro debt, after becoming over-reliant on shorter maturities during the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. As a consequence the average life fell to 6.4 years at end-2013 from 7.2 years at end-2010.
