LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain's top equity index slipped on Wednesday, with insurer Legal & General <LGEN.L> and gambling company William Hill <WMH.L> slumping as changes imposed by the UK budget threatened their profits.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index <.FTSE>, which rose 14.4 percent in 2013 and came close to a 13-year high in January, was down by 0.4 percent, or 24.95 points, at 6,580.33 points in late session trading. British finance minister George Osborne's budget scrapped a requirement that pensions savings be used to buy an annuity. It also imposed a tax on certain betting machines. The first hit Legal & General (L&G), the second William Hill. Both under-performed the broader market decline [ID:nL6N0MG2K5]. L&G slid 7.2 percent lower in heavy volume. Rival Aviva <AV.L> fell 6.7 percent. "The annuity business was a very solid profit driver for the insurers, so you might expect to see some profit downgrades," said Dafydd Davies, senior trader at Prime Wealth Group. William Hill dropped by 7 percent and competing gambling company Ladbrokes <LAD.L> dived 13.3 percent after Osborne announced a new tax on fixed-odds betting terminals. >^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For HIGHLIGHTS on UK budget see [ID:nL6N0MG2K5] UK inflation, unemployment and base rates: http://link.reuters.com/sub42v ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^< LOOKING FOR RECOVERY The FTSE is down by around 2.5 percent since the start of 2014. However, many traders expect it to recover later this year and reach a record high of 7,000 points as the UK's economic recovery continues. The British government's budget watchdog on Wednesday raised its economist forecast for this year.
