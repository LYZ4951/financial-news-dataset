LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - UK bookmakers such as Ladbrokes <LAD.L> and William Hill <WMH.L> turned sharply negative on Wednesday after the UK finance minister announced a new tax on fixed-odds betting terminals.

Ladbrokes fell 5.7 percent while William Hill fell 4.4 percent in just ten minutes after George Osborne said the duty on fixed odds betting terminals would be raised to 25 percent, having traded roughly flat before the announcement. [ID:nL9N0KY01P]
