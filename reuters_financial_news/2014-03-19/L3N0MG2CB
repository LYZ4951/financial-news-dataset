HANOI, March 19 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VN Index <.VNI> climbed 0.96 percent to end at 605.59 points on Wednesday, its highest in nearly four and a half years, boosted by positive sentiment from a central bank move that buys banks more time to tackle toxic debts.

Hanoi-based BIDV <BID.HM> led the gains, with shares rising 3.57 percent. Military Bank <MBB.HM> was up 4.58 percent and steel producer Hoa Phat Group <HPG.HM> jumped 5.21 percent, as most VN30 equities climbed. The State Bank of Vietnam will require lenders to follow a new process of debt classification from Jan. 1 next year, instead of the June 1 date previously set.  The delay, analysts said, was intended to give more time for banks to work at whittling down their non-performing loans ratios while giving enterprises more time to repay their debts. "Investors are optimistic because this postponement benefits not only banks but also other sectors in the economy," said analyst Tran Thang Long at BIDV Securities.
