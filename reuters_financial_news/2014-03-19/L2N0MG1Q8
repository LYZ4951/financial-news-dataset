WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - Greece's international lenders on Wednesday confirmed that they had signed off on the latest review of Greece's rescue package, ending six months of protracted negotiations.

The deal with the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund should unlock Greece's next tranche of loans under its rescue package "in coming weeks," once the IMF's board and the Eurogroup sign off on the review.
