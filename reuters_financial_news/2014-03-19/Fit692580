March 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Series  2012-1E REDS EHP Trust and Series 2013-1 REDS EHP Trust. The transactions are  securitisations of first-ranking small balance auto and equipment loans  originated by Bank of Queensland Equipment Finance Ltd. Fitch has also affirmed  the ratings of Series 2012-1E REDS Trust and Series 2013-1 REDS Trust. These  transactions are securitisations of first-ranking Australian residential  mortgages originated by Bank of Queensland <BOQ.AX> (BoQ, BBB+/Positive/F2).A full list  of rating actions can be found at the end of this commentary.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating actions reflect Fitch's view that credit enhancement levels are able  to support the notes' current ratings. The credit quality and performance of the  loans in the respective collateral pools remain in line with the agency's  expectations. The rating actions reflect Fitch's view that, in line with  expectations of Australia's economic conditions, available credit enhancement is  sufficient to support the notes' current ratings. Principal is being allocated pro-rata since April 2013 as step-down test  conditions have been satisfied for the Series 2012-1E REDS EHP transaction. In  the case of Series 2012-1E REDS, principal collections are being allocated to  the repayment of the Class A1 notes, which have benefited from an increase in  credit enhancement due to sequential amortisation and seasoning since issuance.  Principal will be paid pro-rata as step down conditions were satisfied in  January 2014 for Series 2013-1 REDS EHP. The subordination on Series 2013-1 REDS  continues to grow from closing as all available principal is being allocated to  paying down the Class A1 notes.  As at end-Jan 2014, all transactions have performed in line with Fitch's  expectations given the current economic backdrop. 30+ days arrears stand at 0.8%  and 0.03% of the underlying auto and equipment loan balances respectively for  Series 2012-1E REDS EHP and Series 2013-1 REDS EHP. Cumulative losses stood at  AUD3m and AUD2m respectively for Series 2012-1E REDS EHP and Series 2013-1 REDS  EHP, which have been recovered through excess spread. The excess spread reserve  has reached the maximum balance permitted under the documents, of AUD 2.31m, and  will be available to cover any potential future losses for the Series 2012-1E  REDS EHP Trust. Series 2013-1 REDS EHP closed in May 2013 and has had a  relatively small time period to report arrears and losses. When compared with  other similar transactions, arrears and losses over this period have been  comparable to the earlier Series 2012-1E REDS EHP, and are below Fitch's ABS  Dinkum Index.  In the case of Series 2012-1E REDS and Series 2013-1 REDS, 30+ days arrears  stood at 0.81% and 1.2% of the residential portfolio respectively at end-Jan  2014. While there has been one foreclosure to date for both transactions, no  realised losses have been incurred by the transactions. All loans in the pool  are covered by lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) provided by QBE Lenders'  Mortgage Insurance Limited (Insurer Financial Strength rating: AA-/Stable) and  Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd. Series 2013-1 REDS' excess spread  reserve has a balance of AUD3m that can be used as a source of liquidity. At  end-Jan 2014 there was no credit balance for the excess spread reserve for  Series 2012-1E REDS, and this will remain the case until specific excess spread  trap conditions are satisfied. The current weighted average loan-to-value ratio  (LVR) stands at 50.1% and 51.6% respectively for Series 2012-1E REDS and Series  2013-1 REDS, while the current indexed LVR stands at 50.8% and 51% respectively.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Based on transaction performance, the likelihood of a downgrade of the senior  note classes is remote. Significant increases in loss severity and foreclosure  frequency, well above current break-even credit support levels, would need to  occur before any downgrade could be considered. The sequential pay-down of the transactions has increased the senior notes'  credit enhancement, which can withstand multiples of the latest reported  arrears. Unlike the Series 2012-1E REDS' Class B notes, which are dependent on  the support of the LMI providers, the Class A notes from Series 2012-1E REDS and  Series 2013-1 REDS are independent of downgrades to the LMI providers' ratings. Fitch's initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further  discussed in the transactions' corresponding New Issue reports listed under  "Related Research".
