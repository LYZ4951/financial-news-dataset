NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wednesday, putting major indexes on track for a third day of gains, as investors looked ahead to comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.

* The S&P 500 looked to open near record levels despite sour notes sounded by weak results from FedEx Corp <FDX.N>, an economic bellwether, and Oracle Corp <ORCL.N>. * FedEx posted third-quarter results that were below expectations and gave a weak full-year profit forecast, saying it had been significantly hurt by winter storms. The stock fell 0.1 percent to $138.50 in premarket trading. [ID:nL2N0MG0GG] * Geopolitical concerns remained in view after Ukraine's acting defense minister said the country's forces would not withdraw from Crimea after the region voted to join Russia in a disputed referendum.  * Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a treaty to make it part of Russia, and while no violence was reported as pro-Russian forces took control of part of a Ukraine naval base, investors are concerned that tensions in the region could escalate. [ID:nL6N0MG1GU] * Technology shares will be in view a day after results from both Oracle and Adobe Systems Inc <ADBE.O>. Oracle reported revenue that was below estimates, dashing hopes for a sustained turnaround and sending shares down 3.2 percent to $37.61 before the bell. Adobe rose 1.3 percent to $69.40 in premarket after it gave a second-quarter revenue outlook that was ahead of analyst forecasts. [ID:nL2N0MF1TE] [ID:nL3N0MF437] * The Fed will announce its policy decision in a statement at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), concluding a two-day meeting. That will be followed by Yellen's first news conference as chair. * The Fed is not expected to deviate from its policy path so far, and analysts said a further reduction in the central bank's stimulative bond-buying program was largely priced into markets. Still, as the Fed's stimulus has kept a floor under equity prices, market participants will be attuned to any comments on the speed of future cuts, as well as how soon interest rates might be raised. [ID:nL2N0ME0YD] * S&P 500 futures <SPc2> rose 2.9 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc2> added 22 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc2> rose 7.5 points. * Equities have rallied this week, boosted by easing geopolitical concerns, though trading volumes have been light. The S&P 500 <.SPX> has risen 1.7 percent over the past two days, the best back-to-back performance for the benchmark index since early February, putting it just 0.3 percent away from a record closing high of earlier this month. * JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said it would sell its physical commodities business to Swiss trade house Mercuria for $3.5 billion. * KB Home <KBH.N> rose 5.8 percent to $18.70 after the company reported its first-quarter results.For Market Pulse:  [WATCH/US]  For running updates on what's moving U.S. stocks: [STXNEWS/US] ==============================================================  For other U.S. market data and news:   U.S. Equities speed guide........................<US/EQUITY>   S&P 500 index ........................................<.SPX>   Dow Jones industrial average..........................<.DJI>   Nasdaq Composite index...............................<.IXIC>   Nasdaq 100............................................<.NDX>   Thomson Reuters US Index .......................<.TRXFLDUSP>  Russell 2000 small cap................................<.RUT>   S&P major sectors..............................<0#.GSPMAJOR>   NYSE most active.....................................<.AV.N>   Nasdaq most active...................................<.AV.O>   Top NYSE pct gainers.................................<.PG.N>   Top NYSE pct losers..................................<.PL.N>   Top Nasdaq pct gainers...............................<.PG.O>   Top Nasdaq pct losers................................<.PL.O>   52 week highs:  NYSE...............<t.YH.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YH.O>   52 week lows:  NYSE...............<t.YL.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YL.O>Main global stock indexes and market reports:   FTSE Eurotop 300 .....<.FTEU3>  European report .......[.EU]   Nikkei 225.............<.N225>  Tokyo report............[.T]   FTSE 100...............<.FTSE>  London report...........[.L]   Xetra DAX.............<.GDAXI>  Frankfurt market stories[.F]   CAC-40.................<.FCHI>  Paris market stories...[.PA]   World Indices.....................................<0#.INDEX>   Reuters survey of world bourse outlook.........<EQUITYPOLL1>   U.S. IPO diary........................................[IPO/]   U.S. Asset Allocation Table.......................[US/ASSET] More Reuters News on equities at a glance:   Equities ............[E]   US company news.........[TOP/EQU]Key non-equities market reports:   Foreign exchange......................................[FRX/]   Oil....................................................[O/R]   US Treasuries.........................................[US/N]   International bonds...................................[EUB/]   Gold.......................................[GOL/X] or [GOL/]   ))  Keywords: MARKETS USA STOCKS
