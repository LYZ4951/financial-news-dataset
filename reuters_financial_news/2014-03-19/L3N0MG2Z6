BANGKOK, March 19 (Reuters) - Thai stocks gave up early gains to end lower on Wednesday on institutional-led selling while Singapore shares snapped a two-day winning streak, with shares of CapitaLand <CATL.SI> easing after it sold stake in an Australian firm.[ID:nL3N0MF4TF]

Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> closed down 0.6 percent, extending Tuesday's fall. Profit-taking sent shares of hotelier Central Plaza Hotel <CENTEL.BK> down 3.9 percent, making it the worst performer among the top 50 large-caps <.SET50>. The rise in Thai shares this year has kept some investors cautious on valuations, said strategist Koraphat Vorachet of broker Nomura Pattanasin in Bangkok.   "Investors are more careful on stock valuations. This market psychology is likely to lead to more consolidation," he added. Domestic institutions sold shares worth a net 1.29 billion baht ($40.11 million) while foreign investors bought a net 1 billion baht ($31.09 million), turning net buyers for a second consecutive day, after an emergency decree was lifted.
