PARIS, March 19 (Reuters) - French cable operator Numericable <NUME.PA> said on Wednesday that it had received commitments from a syndicate of nine international banks to fund its planned purchase of Vivendi's <VIV.PA> mobile phone unit SFR.

Numericable, which is now in exclusive talks with SFR despite opposition from France's industry minister Arnaud Montebourg who had openly favoured rival Bougues <BOUY.PA>, said the deal would have "no negative social impact" and that it would not raise 4G prices.
