VIENNA, March 19 (Reuters) - Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI>, a top-10 bank in Russia, is seeing Russian customers bring lots of money back home ahead of potential asset freezes in the West over the Ukrainian political crisis.

"We are not concerned but of course are observing the situation very closely. After yesterday's speech by President Putin we do not expect the conflict to escalate," central and eastern Europe's second-biggest lender said in a statement.
