MOSCOW, March 19 (Reuters) - VTB <VTBR.MM>, Russia's No.2 bank, is expected to report a 30 percent increase in fourth quarter profit due to a one-off gain from its investment in Tele2 Russia, analysts said.

VTB's third-quarter net profit is expected to reach 39.6 billion roubles ($1.1 billion), according to analysts' average forecast, compared with 30.4 billion in the same period of 2012. However, under those expectations, the bank is unlikely to hit its annual profit forecast of more than 100 billion roubles - the same forecast it made but did not meet in 2012 and 2011. In 2012 it reported 90.6 billion and in 2011 it made 90.5 billion. [ID:nL6N0E20Y7] [ID:nL5N0JK262] "One of the main areas of interest is whether VTB will meet its annual net income forecast of 100 billion roubles," wrote Gazprombank analyst Andrey Klapko in a research note, adding that he expected the results to come in just short of the annual target. VTB reported net income of 46 billion roubles for the first nine months of 2013.   Bad loan provisions are projected to rise to 20.7 billion roubles from 14.5 billion the year earlier. Analysts predict a one-off gain from its investment in Tele2 Russia, the country's No.4 mobile operator that VTB bought in April from Sweden's Tele2 <TEL2b.ST> for $3.55 billion. VTB sold 50 percent in October and in February announced the merger of the unit with the mobile assets of telecoms group Rostelecom <RTKM.MM> into a single company, T2 RTK Holding. [ID:nL5N0LB1Q3] "The largest contribution (to profits) in our view, will come from revaluation of the equity stake in mobile operator Tele2," said Klapko. VTB has said it has exposure to Ukraine of 20 billion roubles, largely through big private companies, some of which are exporters. The bank's business in Ukraine amounts to about 2-3 percent of total operations, it has said. The bank did not confirm which day it would report although one analyst report said the results were due on Thursday.
