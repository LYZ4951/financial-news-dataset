NAIROBI, March 19 (Reuters) - The yield on Kenya's 182-day Treasury bills <KE6MT=RR> edged lower to 9.924 percent at auction on Wednesday from 10.045 percent at last week's sale, the central bank said.

The yield on the one year bills <KE1YT=RR> also fell to 10.379 percent from 10.414 percent previously.  The central bank said investors offered 3.7 billion shillings ($42.73 million) for 3 billion shillings worth of 182-day paper for sale. The one year securities received bids worth 2.7 billion shillings, slightly short of the 3 billion shillings on offer.
