MOSCOW, March 19 (Reuters) - Russian state-controlled telecoms group Rostelecom <RTKM.MM> reported on Wednesday flat sales and a decline in earnings for the final quarter of 2013, hit by lower revenues from fixed-line calls and a high base effect.

Net profit for the fourth quarter was 1 billion roubles ($27.56 million), down from 2.7 billion roubles the year earlier, while revenues were unchanged at 85.3 billion roubles, the former fixed-line monopoly said in a statement.
