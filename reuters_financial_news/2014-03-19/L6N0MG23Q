LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Britain's troubled Co-operative Group <42TE.L> said on Wednesday it would delay publication of its full-year results as it detailed changes to its executive management team in the wake of the abrupt exit of its chief executive earlier this month.

The 170-year-old mutually owned-group, which includes food shops and funeral parlours and a stake in Co-op Bank, said it would now publish its annual results and accounts on April 17. They had been scheduled to be released on March 26. The Co-op said Richard Pennycook, who took on the role of interim group chief executive when Euan Sutherland resigned as CEO on March 11, would become chief operating officer when a permanent group CEO had been appointed. Pennycook's COO role will oversee finance/procurement, IT, risk and transformation delivery. A search for an interim COO has started. The group said Steve Murrells, CEO retail, will maintain responsibility for food, pharmacy, farms and e-store but will also take on responsibility for property and estates. Rod Bulmer will join the Co-op's management executive as CEO consumer service in June with responsibility for general insurance, funeralcare and legal services. He was previously deputy CEO at The Co-operative Bank. Amongst further changes Mark Summerfield has been appointed managing director of The Co-operative Banking Group and will oversee work to separate the group from The Co-operative Bank. The Co-op said its annual meeting was still slated for May 17, at which members will hear details of the group's strategy review.
