LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - European stocks steadied on Wednesday as traders held fire ahead of a policy update from the U.S. Federal Reserve, whose ultra-easy monetary stance has been a key driver of a sharp equity rally over the past 1-1/2 years.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> index was up 0.1 percent at 1,307.34 points. Spain's Ibex 35 <.IBEX> outperformed as global clothing giant Inditex <ITX.MC> rallied after 3.5 reporting its 2013 results and saying early 2014 sales had shot up. [ID:nL6N0MG0YD] Traders said the market was positioned for disappointment from the owner of the Zara fashion chain heading into the update. Its shares had fallen roughly 7 percent over the previous 30 days as analysts cut gross operating profit estimates, Thomson Reuters data showed.
