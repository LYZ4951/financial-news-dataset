LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - British detectives investigating the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann said they were looking for a man suspected of carrying out a series of sexual assaults on young girls staying in Portuguese holiday villas between 2004 and 2010.

McCann, then aged three, went missing from her bedroom at the Praia da Luz holiday resort in the Algarve while her parents were dining with friends at a nearby restaurant, leading to a global search that gripped the world's media. London police, who started a review of the case in 2011 and began their own investigation last year, said on Wednesday that they were looking for more information about 12 crimes committed in Portuguese holiday resorts.
