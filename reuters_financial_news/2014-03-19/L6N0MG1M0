March 19 (Reuters) - Position: Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (central bank)

Incumbent: Fahad al-Mubarak Term: Since December 2011  Key facts: -- Fahad bin Abdullah al-Mubarak was appointed by Saudi King Abdullah to head the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), succeeding Muhammad al-Jasser.  -- Mubarak, who comes from outside of the central bank and is a private-sector, market-focused figure, was previously chairman and managing director of Morgan Stanley Saudi Arabia. He has also held the position of chairman of the Saudi stock exchange.  -- He played a role in the privatisation of Saudi Telecom <7010.SE> and was a member of the team, which discussed the partial privatisation of Saudi Arabia's National Gas Industry with international oil companies.  -- As governor, Mubarak strengthened the private-sector make-up of senior SAMA staff by appointing former JPMorgan Chase regional head Abdulaziz al-Helaissi as deputy governor in May 2013. -- Asked in March 2014 if he was worried about continued high Saudi fiscal spending, which has elicited warnings from economists, he said forecasts for future oil income suggested Riyadh could maintain its recent run of budget surpluses. -- Since his appointment, Mubarak has overseen the development of new regulations covering the long-expected mortgage and real estate finance laws, but has maintained the kingdom's conservative monetary policy that is defined by the riyal currency peg to the U.S. dollar. -- SAMA manages more than $718 billion in foreign assets and in March 2014 he said the Chinese Yuan is a good option for diversifying foreign currency revenues, but that it was far from becoming a reserve currency.  -- Mubarak, who is from Saudi Arabia's oil-producing Eastern Province, served as a member of the Shura Council, a consultative body which advises the government on legislative matters, for six years during which he was vice chairman of its economic and energy committee.
