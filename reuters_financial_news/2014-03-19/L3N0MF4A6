SYDNEY, March 19 (Reuters) - Australian shares were little changed in choppy trade on Wednesday, with investors remaining cautious even as the threat of a military conflict in Ukraine eased and ahead of a looming  policy review by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The market has drifted lower in March after rallying 4.1 percent in February, as tensions in Ukraine and disappointing data from China soured sentiment. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks climbed for a second straight session, with the S&P 500 <.SPX> within striking distance of its record after comments from Russian President Vladimir Putin that he did not plan to seize other regions of Ukraine were taken as a signal that the crisis may not deepen.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> tacked on 1.9 points to 5,346.5 by 0132 GMT. Shares in Stockland Group <SGP.AX> dropped 2.3 percent to five-week lows after the company said it bought a strategic 19.9 percent stake in Australand, dragging other REITs along with it. "We ultimately think they'll make a full takeover for Australand, but that would mean a sizeable equity raising and that's what the market's thinking about in the background," said John Milroy, investment adviser at Macquarie Bank. "There will be benefits along the way for them, certainly Australand trading at a premium to its NTAs (net tangible assets) to the tune of 8 percent, it looks like a full price." Singapore's CapitaLand Ltd <CATL.SI> had earlier said it sold its remaining 39.1 percent stake in Australia's Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX> for around $849 million.
