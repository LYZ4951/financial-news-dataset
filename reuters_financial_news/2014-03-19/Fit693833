March 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings' recent downgrade of the Regional  Transportation District (RTD) Certificates of Participation (COP) bonds to 'A'  with a Negative Outlook from 'A+', will not impact the rating of RTD's $398  million Series 2010 private activity bonds (PABs) rated 'BBB-' with a Stable  Outlook.  The PABs were issued on behalf of Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for the Eagle  Project (the project), which represents a critical part of RTD's regional  transit network development plan procured through a public private partnership  agreement with DTP to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the project.  Under the agreement RTD will compensate DTP through an availability payment  mechanism.  To understand the credit implications of the COP downgrade on the project it is  important to highlight where the availability payments fall within the RTD  waterfall. The availability payments for the project are divided into two  pieces: (1) the capital (debt service) portion and (2) operations and  maintenance (O&M) portion. The debt service portion of the availability payment  is subordinate to RTD's outstanding senior (rated 'AA+'; Stable Outlook) and  FasTracks bonds (rated 'AA'; Stable Outlook) but senior to the COPs. The O&M  portion of the availability payment is on parity with the COPs.  Consistent with Fitch's availability payment criteria the credit strength of the  payment revenue stream from the grantor serves as an input and in most instances  a cap on the overall project rating. In the case of Project Eagle a grantor  revenue stream of 'A' with a Negative Outlook credit quality does not act as a  constraint to the project rating of 'BBB-'. As part of its review process Fitch  monitors the credit strength of the availability payment revenue stream  throughout the life of the transaction to ensure the overall project rating  accurately reflects the revenue risk embedded in the project. If the credit  quality of the availability payment revenue stream were to decline below that of  the project the project's credit rating would likely be downgraded.   In addition to evaluating revenue risk, Fitch's availability payment ratings  also reflect the following: completion risk, operation risk, infrastructure  renewal and replacement, as well as debt structure, all of which Fitch monitors  as part of its review process. Fitch's assessment of these risks has not changed  since Project Eagle achieved financial close and the project has maintained its  'BBB-' rating with a Stable Outlook.
