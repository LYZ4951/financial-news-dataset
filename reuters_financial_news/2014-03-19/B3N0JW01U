BUDAPEST, March 19 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Wednesday his government would press on with its past economic policy approach if re-elected for another four-year term at an April 6 election that his ruling Fidesz party looks well-placed to win.

"Our (election) programme can be summed up in a single word: we will continue. Put more modestly: we would like to continue," Orban told an economic conference held by the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
