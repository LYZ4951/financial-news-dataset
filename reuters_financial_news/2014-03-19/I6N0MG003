MILAN, March 19 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia's <TLIT.MI> largest investor Telco said on Wednesday it had proposed Giuseppe Recchi as chairman of Italy's largest phone group in a list of directors presented for the renewal of the company's board.

The 13 people in the list are mostly independent directors.  The slate also includes current chief executive Marco Patuano.

Telecom Italia shareholders meet on April 16 to name a new board following the expiry of the three-year term of the current one.
