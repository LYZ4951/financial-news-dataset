STOCKHOLM, March 19 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at 6.00 percent on Wednesday and said that the inflation outlook in the near term had moderated though longer term pressures remained.

"Whether there is scope for a nominal interest rate reduction will depend on developments in inflation and inflation expectations in coming months," the central bank said in a statement.  In the longer term, inflation is expected to rise again as domestic demand growth gains momentum and the slack in the economy gives way to a positive output gap. "Further ahead, the Bank's real rate must be raised further if the above-described outlook materialises," the central bank said in a statement.
