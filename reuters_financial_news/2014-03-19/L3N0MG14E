BANGKOK, March 19 (Reuters) - Thai shares rose on Wednesday as investors bought large caps and tourism-related stocks after the government lifted a state of emergency in Bangkok, while Singapore's CapitaLand <CATL.SI> fell to a near 21-month low after selling its remaining stake in an Australian firm.

Thai SET index <.SETI> was up 0.5 percent by midday, recovering from the fall on Tuesday when investors booked profits in the overbought market. Shares of telecommunications firm Advanced Info Service Pcl <ADVANC.BK>, Kasikornbank Pcl <KBANK.BK> and Central Plaza Hotel <CENTEL.BK> were among outperformers on the top 50 large caps <.SET50>. The government's decision to lift the emergency decree could be supportive to the Thai stock market sentiment, brokers said. Foreign investors bought shares worth a net $62.19 million on Tuesday, their first in three sessions, following the announcement. [ID:nL3N0MF18I] "We can expect a return of foreign funds. Foreign investors have left this market for a while since the declaration of the state of emergency in January," said Tisco Securities senior strategist Viwat Techapoonphol. Market investors will also focus on Thai Constitutional Court ruling on Feb. 2 poll case on Friday for a clearer outlook of the domestic political crisis. The court set the ruling date after conducting a hearing on the case early on Wednesday. In Singapore, shares of CapitaLand dropped as much as 1.5 percent to S$2.7, their lowest in nearly 21 months, after the company said it had sold its remaining stake in Australia's Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX>. [ID:nL3N0MF4TF] Other property shares, including Hongkong Land Holdings <HKLD.SI>, City Developments Ltd <CTDM.SI> were among underperformers on the benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI>. "News that existing stock of unsold properties have been clearing at lower prices and CapitaLand's sale of its remaining Australand stake - after calling it a key investment last November - does not augur well for the property sector," brokerage firm NRA Capital said in a report. Other markets were mostly rangebound, while Asian stocks <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell amid the backdrop of East-West geopolitical tensions involving Ukraine and ahead of a closely watched Federal Reserve policy review later in the session. [MKTS/GLOB] Indonesian shares <.JKSE> edged up 0.3 percent after retreating on Tuesday in part due to profit-taking by local pension funds, broker Trimegah Securities said. Among bright spots, shares of Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp <SMC.PS> climbed 2.1 percent, after a combined 26 percent rally over the past three sessions. San Miguel Corp said it was not selling its controlling stake in liquor maker Ginebra San Miguel Inc <GSMI.PS> after shares in both firms surged amid market talk about a Ginebra sale.
