MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Reuters) - Mexico's third-largest bank Banorte lent around $40 million to the oilfield services company at the center of an alleged fraud which forced Citigroup <C.N> to cut its 2013 profit, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Banorte <GFNORTEO.MX> is in the process of putting aside a provision for the loan in case of non-payment. But the outcome of the loan will depend on the results of the investigation into oilfield services firm Oceanografia, a major contractor of Mexico's state-run oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL], the person added. Citigroup said last month it uncovered at least $400 million in bogus loans to Oceanografia at its Mexican subsidiary, Banamex. [ID:nL1N0LX187] The government has said it will neither rescue nor nationalise Oceanografia. Mexico's government has taken control of Oceanografia and begun a criminal investigation. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the transactions, people familiar with the probes have said. [ID:nL1N0LZ0C1] Forty million dollars would represent around 0.13 percent of Banorte's loan portfolio, according to Reuters estimates. The source declined to give details of the terms of the loan.
