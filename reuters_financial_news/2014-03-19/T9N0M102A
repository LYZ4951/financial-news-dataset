TOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Seibu Holdings said on Wednesday that it has submitted plans to list its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in what is expected to be one of the country's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in 2014.

It is still unclear how many shares Cerberus Capital Management [CBS.UL], the company's largest shareholder with a 35.48 percent stake, will sell in the IPO.
