DUBAI, June 1 (Reuters) - Dubai's Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> said on Sunday that its Emaar Malls Group has raised a $1.5 billion sharia-compliant loan through a consortium of local banks to optimise its capital structure ahead of a planned listing of the unit.

Emaar said the loan is repayable in seven years and carries a profit rate of 1.75 percent over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). The funds are provided on an equal basis by three Dubai lenders - Dubai Islamic Bank <DISB.DU>, Mashreq <MASQ.DU> and Noor Bank - and two from Abu Dhabi - First Gulf Bank <FGB.AD> and National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, Reuters reported on Thursday. [ID:nL6N0OE36T] Emaar did not specify which banks were involved in the statement.
