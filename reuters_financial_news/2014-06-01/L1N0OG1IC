LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - "Maleficent," Walt Disney's <DIS.N> special-effects laden take on "Sleeping Beauty's" wicked fairy godmother, captivated moviegoers collecting $70 million in ticket sales to win the weekend box office stakes.

The movie starring Angelina Jolie as the black-robed villain finished far ahead of last week's winner, "X-Men: Days of Future Past," which took $32.6 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters. Seth MacFarlane's western comedy "A Million Ways to Die in the West" was third with $17.1 million for the three days from Friday to Sunday.
