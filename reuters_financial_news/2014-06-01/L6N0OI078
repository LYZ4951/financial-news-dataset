CAIRO, June 1 (Reuters) - The Egyptian Exchange halted stock trading for half an hour on Sunday morning because of an unusually sharp move in the market, it said.

The broad index <.EGX100> was down 5.0 percent in response to the government's plan to introduce a capital gains tax. "A decision was made to stop the trading session on Sunday for half an hour and resume at 1149 (0849 GMT) because the EGX 100 dropped by 5 percent," the bourse said in a statement.
