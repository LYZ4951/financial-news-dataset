HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, May 5 (Reuters) - China's only listed bad debt management firm Cinda Asset Management <1359.HK> is offering bonds worth at least $500 million, its first U.S.-dollar denominated debt, two fund managers who attended a company presentation said on Monday.

The offer is expected to bolster Cinda's asset base in anticipation of a spurt in bad loans as China's economy slows. The company is meeting investors in Hong Kong, Singapore and New York this week to raise the funds.
