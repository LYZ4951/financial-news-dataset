NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street's biggest banks quarterly earnings offer a glimpse into the scale of their commodity trading activity through a measure of trading risk called VaR.

Citigroup joined Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> in reporting higher commodity markets VaR. All three banks also reported higher net revenues in commodities. JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> reported earlier that its commodity markets VaR fell to its lowest in nine years in the first quarter of 2014 as it prepared to complete the sale of its physical commodities business. On March 19, it an announced a $3.5 billion deal to sell it to Swiss-based trading house Mercuria.
