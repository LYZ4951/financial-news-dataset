BERLIN, May 5 (Reuters) - The level of the euro is an issue for the European Central Bank and politicians should refrain from trying to influence the rate, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said on Monday, indirectly criticising French Prime Minister Manuel Valls.

Valls said over the weekend that the euro was "too high" and that a "more appropriate" monetary policy was needed to bring it down.
