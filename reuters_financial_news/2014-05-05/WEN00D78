NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's <PFE.N> top officials said on Monday they were weighing all strategies, including potential hostile maneuvers, in the company's effort to complete its intended takeover of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc <AZN.L>.

"Any option you can think of would be an option," Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio told Reuters in a telephone interview, when asked whether Pfizer might take its case directly to Astra shareholders before a May 26 deadline. That is the date by which British takeover law requires Pfizer to either make a bid for the London-based rival or walk away, unless both companies agree to seek an extension of the deadline.
