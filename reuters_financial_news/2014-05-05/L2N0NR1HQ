NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman said on Monday that he recommends the shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FNCC.OB> because the companies have low liquidity risk.

Ackman, speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, said the shares of the companies, both of which are now trading around $4 a share, could be worth $23.
