The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.1 percent at 2,027.35 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.1 percent. The HSBC/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for April came in at 48.1 on Monday, lower than a preliminary reading of 48.3, though up slightly from an eight-month low of 48.0 in March.
