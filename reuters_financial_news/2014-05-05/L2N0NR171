May 5 (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman, Allergan Inc's <AGN.N> largest shareholder, has cautioned the company against pursuing any alternative deal that did not offer a better value than Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's <VRTX.O> $47 billion bid.

Valeant teamed up with Ackman last month to make an unsolicited offer for Allergan. Allergan is preparing to approach Shire Plc <SHP.L> about a potential takeover, even though the Irish drugmaker rebuffed a previous overture, Reuters reported last week. [ID:nL6N0NL25Z] "Even if Allergan were able to identify a transaction that offers a higher cash value than the estimated value of the Valeant proposal at the time of transaction closure, we do not believe such a cash transaction would be necessarily superior to Valeant's stock and cash offer," Ackman said Monday in letter to Michael Gallagher, lead director of Allergan.
