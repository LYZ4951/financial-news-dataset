SAO PAULO, May 5 (Reuters) - Profit at Cielo SA <CIEL3.SA>, Brazil's largest card payment processor, likely rose in the first quarter as card transaction volumes rose and prepayment revenues remained resilient amid an economic slowdown, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

Net income at the Barueri, Brazil-based company likely rose 2 percent to 737 million reais ($331 million) on a quarter-on-quarter basis, according to the average estimate of five analysts. Compared with the same period a year earlier, profit rose 14.6 percent, the poll estimated. The merchant acquirer releases first-quarter results late on Tuesday. Management and investors will discuss results on a Wednesday conference call focusing on competition, pricing and volume trends, and the impact of the soccer World Cup in June on revenue.  Net revenue probably climbed 5.3 percent to 1.95 billion reais, with higher transaction volumes for debit and credit card payments as well as more equipment rentals propelling revenue gains, the poll found. Prepayment of receivables also bolstered revenues as Cielo sharpened its focus for the segment on large retailers. Despite expectations of robust results in the quarter, Cielo's strong earnings momentum could fail to support a more positive stance on the stock, which is trading at a higher multiple than many other financial stocks and peers globally, analysts such as Boris Molina of Santander Investment Securities said. Risks of mounting competition could weigh down on the shares, which are up 55 percent over the past year. "We forecast that the anticipation of strong results, as well as some tailwinds for 2014, is already priced in," Molina and his team wrote in a recent client note. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profitability known as EBITDA, rose 1.6 percent to 927 million reais, according to the poll. It estimated that EBITDA rose to an average 55.8 percent of net revenue in the quarter, from 49.2 percent in the previous three months. Cielo probably lost customers to Itaú Unibanco Holding SA's <ITUB4.SA> Rede unit in the quarter, the poll found. Rede, Brazil's No. 2 acquirer, aims to grab some of Cielo's clients in the small- and mid-sized corporate segment. A price war is unlikely, analysts said.
