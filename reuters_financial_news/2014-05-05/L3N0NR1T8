May 5 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian markets ended weaker on Monday, with Malaysia and Singapore closing at near one-week lows despite foreign inflows as disappointing Chinese manufacturing activity raised concerns over economic growth momentum in the world's second-largest economy.

The Malaysian index <.KLSE> ended 0.5 percent down at its lowest close since April 29 led by financials, while Singapore <.FTSTI> lost 0.3 percent led by property shares, also ending at its lowest since April 29.  Activity in China's manufacturing sector contracted for a fourth consecutive month in April, a private survey showed on Monday, adding to questions about whether the world's second-largest economy is still losing momentum. [ID:nB9N0MU00Q] The Vietnamese market <.VNI>, which resumed trading after a holiday since April 29, also closed 2.3 percent at its lowest level since April 21 as pessimistic investors offloaded stocks on lack of supportive news.  Foreign investors, however, were on the buying side. Kuala Lumpur saw a net inflow of $17.39 million, Jakarta recorded $26.50 million, while Manila had $12.13 million.  Bucking the trend, the Philippine index <.PSI> ended 0.4 percent higher, led by a 3.2 percent gain in conglomerate SM investments Corp <SM.PS> after its property unit SM Prime Holdings Inc <SMPH.PS> posted a 11 percent gain in March quarter net income.  Jakarta <.JKSE> ended just 0.1 percent up as Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, posted its slowest growth in more than four years. [ID:nL3N0NO35G].  After the market closed, Genting Singapore PLC <GENS.SI> said its core earnings for the quarter ended March 31 soared 60 percent on the year as gaming income recorded robust gains. [ID:nL3N0NR1O3] The Thai market <.SETI> was closed on Monday for a holiday.
