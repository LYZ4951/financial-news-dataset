May 5 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian markets fell on Monday, with Malaysia and Singapore trading near one-week lows as disappointing Chinese manufacturing activity raised concerns about the economic growth momentum in the world's second-largest economy.

The Malaysian stock index <.KLSE> was down 0.4 percent by 0632 GMT while the Singapore index <.FTSTI> was 0.1 percent weaker. Activity in China's manufacturing sector contracted for a fourth consecutive month in April, a private survey showed on Monday, adding to questions about whether the world's second-largest economy is still losing momentum.

Bucking the trend, the Philippine stock index <.PSI> was 0.3 percent firmer after recovering from an early loss, while the Jakarta Composite index <.JKSE> was steady as Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, posted its slowest growth in more than four years.
