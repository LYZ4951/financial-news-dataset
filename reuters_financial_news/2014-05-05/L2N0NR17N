NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont recommended Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O> at an investment conference on Monday, saying that fresh demand in broadband services will help boost growth at the company.

Laffont, speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, said Liberty's shares, now trading around $40 a share, could "easily" rise above $100 per share. He said the huge popularity in video streaming service Netflix <NFLX.O> will force homeowners to upgrade their broadband. Laffont described Liberty Global's business as "awesome" and praised the company's chief executive, John Malone.
