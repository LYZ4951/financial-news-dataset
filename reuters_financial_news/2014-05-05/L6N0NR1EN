KAMPALA, May 5 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> was stable on Monday, but demand for dollars from energy and manufacturing companies was expected to put some pressure on the currency.

At 1047 GMT, the currency was quoted at 2,520/2,530, unchanged from Friday's close. "Going forward, we think the bias is on the depreciation side, because we're seeing substantial demand from manufacturing and energy sectors," said Faisal Bukenya, head of market making at Barclays Bank. The shilling is largely stable in the year to date, underpinned by weak corporate demand and portfolio flows from foreign investors buying up Uganda government debt.  Analysts say the shilling's outlook is weak after the central bank trimmed its forecast for 2013/14 growth, citing a slowdown in agricultural output. The economy is expected to expand by 5.7 percent in the year ending in June, down from 6 percent. A note from KCB Uganda said a drop in yields on Ugandan debt was also "likely to affect dollar inflows from offshore investors and thus further weaken the local unit." Yields fell across all maturities of Treasury bills an last week's auction worth 120 billion shillings ($47.49 million) which was heavily oversubscribed.
