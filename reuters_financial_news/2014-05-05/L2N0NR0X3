SAO PAULO, May 5 (Reuters) - Shares of Brazil's largest non-government bank, Itau Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA> now carry the heaviest weighting on the benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP>, topping state-run oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA <PETR4.SA>, exchange operator BM&FBovespa SA <BVMF3.SA> said on Monday.

The oil firm known as Petrobras has lost about half of its market value over the past three years, hurt by a government policy that forces it to sell imported fuel at a loss to tamp down inflation. BM&FBovespa makes modifications to the index every four months. A new Bovespa index weighting scheme this year takes into account market value as opposed to trading volume, which was used in previous years. Shares of mining company MMX Mineração e Metálicos SA <MMXM3.SA> were added to the benchmark index on Monday while shares of medical diagnostics firm Diagnósticos da América SA, known as Dasa SA <DASA3.SA>, and logistics firm Prumo Logistica SA <PRML3.SA>, formerly known as LLX, were removed.
