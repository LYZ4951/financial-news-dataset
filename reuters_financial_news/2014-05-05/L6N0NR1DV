DUBAI, May 5 (Reuters) - Ahli United Bank, Bahrain's largest lender, posted a 56 percent decline in its first-quarter net attributable profit, the bank said on Monday, as it failed to replicate the one-off gain achieved last year from its Qatari stake sale.

The bank's net attributable profit for the opening three months of 2014 was $136.6 million, compared with $309.9 million in the same period of 2013. The bank booked a $212.9 million gain in the first quarter of 2013 after selling a 29.4 percent stake in Qatar's Ahli Bank <AABQ.QA> to Qatar Foundation, a non-profit organisation wholly-owned by the Gulf state's royal family.
