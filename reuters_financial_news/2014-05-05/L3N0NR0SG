NEW DELHI, May 5 (Reuters) - General Electric Co <GE.N> on Monday made tender offers to buy shares worth up to $389 million in two of Alstom SA's <ALSO.PA> India units to comply with local rules, following its $16.9 billion bid to buy the French group's energy unit.

GE has offered to buy 25 percent in Alstom T&D India Ltd <ALST.NS> from public shareholders at 261.25 rupees a share in a deal valued at up to $278 million, according to a notice issued to Indian stock exchanges by the offer manager Credit Suisse. GE is also seeking to buy 26 percent of Alstom India Ltd <ALSM.NS> at 382.20 rupees per share for up to $111 million, said a separate filing. GE will proceed with the offers only if its bid for Alstom's energy arm goes through, the filings said. Cash-strapped French engineering group Alstom said last week it would explore a $16.9 billion offer from General Electric for its energy arm while leaving the door open to a rival bid from Germany's Siemens <SIEGn.DE>. [ID:nL6N0NM15R] Shares in Alstom T&D India were up 6.4 percent at 289.15 rupees, while Alstom India lost early gains and were trading down 0.8 percent at 452 rupees at 0504 GMT. The broader index <.NSEI> was up 0.28 percent.
