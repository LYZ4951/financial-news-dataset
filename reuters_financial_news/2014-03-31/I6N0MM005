TURIN, Italy, March 31 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <FIA.MI> may not need to sell assets to finance its new multi-year industrial plan but could fund it by raising fresh debt, its Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Monday.

"Technically, if I look at the structure today, I'd not sell assets. Raising capital with some type of instrument is still on the table," Marchionne told journalists after a shareholders' meeting.
