March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to rate GE Equipment Small  Ticket, L.L.C., Series 2014-1 as follows:  --$240,250,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf'; --$195,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$195,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$42,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$16,350,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$30,350,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.  Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the presale  report titled 'GE Equipment Small Ticket, L.L.C., Series 2014-1,' dated March  31, 2014, which is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the  link below.   KEY RATING DERIVERS High Concentration of Office Imaging (OI) Equipment: Approximately 90.06% of  series 2014-1 is OI equipment collateral, which is comparable to recent  securitizations.  Decrease in OI Business Segment: Approximately 72.85% of the pool is from GECC's  OI business segment, compared with 89.32% in 2013-1. Loss performance on the OI  portfolio has historically been weaker than that of other OI equipment  collateral. As a result, Fitch's base case loss expectation has decreased from  the prior transaction.  Increase in Booked Residuals: The residual concentration for 2014-1 is 10.75%,  up from 8.10% in 2013-1. Higher residual values (RVs) increase the transaction's  exposure to residual realization risk. The increase in RVs is primarily due to  the increase in seasoning to 11.5 months from 7.0 months in 2013-1.  Improving Asset Performance: GECC's managed static pool data have experienced  improved loss performance for more recent vintages. Furthermore, all  transactions issued by GECC have experienced cumulative net losses (CNLs) inside  of Fitch's initial expectations.  Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: GECC has demonstrated  adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by  historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the  managed portfolio.  Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should  provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of  payments on the securities.  RATING SENSITIVITY  Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on  defaulted receivables could produce CNL levels higher than the base case and  would likely result in declines of CE and remaining loss coverage levels  available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain note ratings susceptible  to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in  coverage.  The similar negative impact on loss coverage can also be expected from a lower  than expected residual realization rate on the leases. Hence, Fitch conducts  sensitivity analysis by eliminating any residual realization benefits and  stressing a transaction's initial base case CNL assumption by 1.5x, as well as  examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The  elimination of residual realization benefits and the 1.5x increase of the base  case CNL represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively, and are intended  to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected  deterioration of a trust's performance.  Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the  accompanying presale report.
