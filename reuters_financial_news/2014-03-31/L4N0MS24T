HANOI, March 31 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> ended down 0.46 percent on Monday, with trading volume falling to the lowest level in more than three weeks as cautious investors held back after recent falls, analysts said.

Volume neared 120 million shares, the lowest since March 5, Reuters data showed. Food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> led the losses, with shares dropping 2.51 percent, followed by Hanoi-based lender BIDV <BID.HM> that fell 1.18 percent. Though buying demand was increasing, the index is unlikely to surpass 600 points as selling force around this level is very high, especially from retailers, said analyst Vu Tran Vinh Thuy at Dai Viet Securities.The index has lost a combined 2.2 percent over the past week, having hit a two-week low on March 26 due to margin selling.
