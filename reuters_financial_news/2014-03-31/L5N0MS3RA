MOSCOW, March 31 (Reuters) - Russia's largest privately owned financial group, Alfa Group, said instability in Ukraine was hurting its financial position and estimated its exposure to the neighbouring country at $781 million.

Turmoil in Ukraine, where protesters toppled pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovich and a pro-Western government has been installed, has pushed the economy to the brink of bankruptcy, worrying lenders about outstanding loans. "Continued instability in Ukraine has a significant negative impact on the operations and financial position of ABH Ukraine Group," ABH Financial Limited said on Monday ABH Financial Limited is part of Alfa Group, which includes Russia's Alfa Bank. At the end of 2013, ABH Financial Limited, controlled by billionaires Mikhail Fridman, German Khan and Alexei Kuzmichova, had balance sheet commitments from ABH Ukraine Group of $237 million and loans of $544 million to Ukrainian borrowers. ABH Ukraine, also part of Alfa Group, controls Alfa Bank Ukraine. ABH Financial said it was looking at various ways of improving liquidity, including possible help from shareholders.
