MILAN, March 31 (Reuters) - Banca Etruria <PEL.MI>, a small Italian lender which is seeking a merger with a stronger peer following advice from the Bank of Italy, said on Monday it posted a 70.3 million euro ($96.89 million) loss in 2013 due to loan and goodwill writedowns.

The Tuscan bank said its Tier 1 capital, a measure of financial strength, stood at 6.6 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of last year. "The 2013 result mirrors the still significant effects of the crisis and of a lack of economic recovery in the areas where the bank operates, with a direct impact on loan writedowns following Bank of Italy's requests to boost the coverage ratio," the bank said.  The bank said in a statement it had put aside 308.7 million euros to cover possible loan losses and had written down goodwill and other intangible assets for 5.2 million euros.
