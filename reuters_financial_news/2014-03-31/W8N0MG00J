WARSAW, March 31 (Reuters) - Poland has financed nearly 70 percent of its borrowing needs for 2014 at the end of March, the head of the finance ministry's debt department, Piotr Marczak, said in a statement on Monday.

Marczak added that the ministry will limit its issuance of treasury bonds starting from May to make room for a tender of infrastructure bonds issued by the state bank BGK.
