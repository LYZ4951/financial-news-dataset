FRANKFURT, March 31 (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer <BAYGn.DE> said on Monday it won approval in the European Union to widen the use of lung drug Adempas to two life-threatening forms of pulmonary hypertension.

The EU Commission cleared the use of the drug, also known as riociguat, for the treatment of chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). U.S. authorities approved the drug for the same uses in October. [ID:nL1N0HY2A7] Bayer counts Adempas among its most promising new drugs, predicting peak annual sales of more than 500 million euros ($688 million).
