March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The vast majority of non-Russian EMEA corporate  ratings would be unaffected by sanctions against Russia, says Fitch Ratings. The Fitch-rated non-Russian issuers most at risk are Carlsberg Breweries, Atrium  European Real Estate, Metro AG <MEOG.DE> and Uranium One. We believe most companies would find ways to mitigate even the worse-case  scenario of a complete halt in their Russian sales and cash flows should the  Ukraine crisis result in wide-ranging measures. They could, for instance, cut  dividends and capex, forgo M&A or conserve cash.  Less severe effects, such as higher funding and energy costs, could be weathered  in the short-term. However, pressure on credit metrics would rise if political  tension persists. Most vulnerable are the handful of corporates that generate a significant  proportion of their revenue or operating profit in Russia. Carlsberg <CARLb.CO> (BBB/Stable) generates around 20% of its revenue in Russia. Should  Carlsberg permanently lose its Russian unit, which we understand is effectively  debt-free, gross FFO leverage would increase by up to 1.5x. The overall profile  would also deteriorate due to lower diversification and fewer resources for  growth, potentially leading to a one-notch downgrade.  The contribution to Carlsberg's consolidated cash flow from Russian operations  is also substantial (we estimate it at more than 30% in 2013), although the loss  would be partly mitigated by the increasing importance of Asia and the  resilience of profits in Western Europe. In a less severe scenario, where the  government weakened management's ability to control strategy, Carlsberg could  find it harder to tackle the many challenges in the Russian beer sector. We take  comfort from its track record of adjusting to adversities in the country and a  step-up in these challenges should be manageable at the current rating. Atrium's (BBB-/Stable) exposure to Russia represents 28% of net rental income  and 19% of its total asset portfolio by value, but only seven out of 153  properties. Nonetheless given its low leverage, a downgrade would be unlikely  even in an extreme scenario. We believe Atrium's balance sheet management  factors in the inherent level of risk in the region. Metro's (BBB-/Stable) revenue exposure to Russia is estimated at below 7%.  Stripping out Russian operating profits, and assuming Metro would not pay its  Russian leases under this scenario, we estimate FFO net leverage could rise by  0.3x-0.4x to around 4.7x. This is still below our guideline for BBB- of below  5x. If the planned IPO of 25% of Metro Cash and Carry (MCC) Russia were  cancelled, leverage would probably only rise 0.1x-0.2x, as the reduction in debt  would be partially offset by the loss of EBITDA on any disposal. It would  however slow MCC's expansion as the proceeds are earmarked for re-investment in  fast-growing countries.  Uranium One (BB-/Stable) generates roughly 40% of its revenue in Russia through  off-take agreements with its ultimate parent, state-owned Rosatom, to supply up  to 51% of its marketable production at spot prices. This includes up to 100% of  attributable production from its Kazakhstan mines. Losing the Russian cash flows  would be detrimental, especially with uranium prices near multi-year lows.
