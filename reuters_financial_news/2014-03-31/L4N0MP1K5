HONG KONG, March 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> led underwriting rankings in Asia Pacific ex-Japan equity capital markets in the first quarter of 2014. Volumes for the industry tumbled 24.3 percent from the same period in 2013 to $37.8 billion, making it the worst start of a year since 2009, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data.

Proceeds from initial public offerings though went in a different direction, surging nearly four times to $12.6 billion on increased activity in Hong Kong and as new listings resumed in Shanghai and Shenzhen after a hiatus of more than one year. Following is a list of the region's top equity capital market underwriters in the first quarter of the year and the estimated fees earned on deals.
