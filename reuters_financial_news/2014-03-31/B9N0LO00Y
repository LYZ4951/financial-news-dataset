HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 31 (Reuters) - China Construction Bank Corp <601939.SS> <0939.HK> plans to issue 20 billion yuan in Basel III-compliant subordinate debt in the Chinese market to replenish tier-2 capital, the bank said in materials circulated at a press conference in Beijing on Monday.

The bank did not give a specific timeline for the debt sale. The country's second biggest bank posted a 9.2 percent on-year rise in net profits for the final three months of 2013 on Sunday, becoming the third of China's four biggest banks to beat market forecasts. [ID:nL3N0ME1NQ]
