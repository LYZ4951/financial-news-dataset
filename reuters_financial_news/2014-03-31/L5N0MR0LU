BERLIN, March 31 (Reuters) - The foreign exchange industry may take years to recover from allegations of collusion and price manipulation and will have to fight to head off a damaging regulatory clampdown, the new head of the sector's main international umbrella organisation said.

Speaking at the end of an annual congress that was the industry's first chance to regroup after six months of revelations, ACI Financial Markets Association chief Marshall Bailey said participants needed to act to ensure the industry was not crippled by over-regulation in response to the widening international probe into alleged wrongdoing. Asked whether there would be more sackings in the row, which has already seen more than 20 traders fired or suspended, Bailey, previously a senior trader and manager of banks' forex operations, said: "Even if there is no further alleged wrongdoing, the current concerns will take years to work out." Some analysts have speculated the row will deliver fines way in excess of the more than $6 billion paid out by banks worldwide so far over the Libor interest rate-fixing scandal.  The FX investigation centres around allegations that a handful of senior traders colluded to use knowledge of client orders to move markets around the daily "fixings", which set prices for billions of contracts and investments worldwide.  Aside from the fines, banks fear that the response to the row from international regulators and politicians will put an end to the "self regulation" model the sector has championed for decades and, in the process, raise the cost of foreign exchange for banks, companies and individuals. Senior figures at banks as well as many of the platforms, brokers and other companies who dominate the world's biggest financial market, seemed unified at the meeting in Berlin in opposing any push to move spot trading to an exchange.  "It will take time to persuade people to take the right decision on this," Bailey said. "The industry is under a more intense microscope than before and that microscope has revealed challenges around the Libor scandals and FX benchmark scandal." "It doesn't make sense to force the industry to do something that's negative for everybody, including the public. We need everyone to understand how a market is more efficient 'over the counter' than it is on an exchange."   CONFUSION The ACI, previously a body on the decline, along with the traditional person-to-person "voice" trading practiced by many of its members, has been revitalised by the row over the benchmark "fixing" rates and the industry's struggle to deal with the weight of new rules thrown at it since 2008. Bailey, appointed on Thursday, is the first full-time chief of a body that traditionally has been run by senior sector managers working voluntarily and part-time. He said the ACI will now be closely involved in efforts by banks to show they are taking action to prevent future abuse. The association is changing its system of certification on best practices for traders to provide more regular updates and education. It has the backing of a number of central banks for its "Model Code" of practice and will be pushing banks and other institutions to adopt it more formally. "The banks need to demonstrate that they can deal with their staffs' behaviour themselves," Bailey said.  Another big takeaway from three days of meetings in Berlin was the extent to which sector players believe the fixing row has quelled some activity on the market. "At some banks, traders don't want to accept orders because they don't want to get on the wrong side of it inadvertently. And clients don't know which banks to go to because they don't know which banks have the best practices and systems in place, or are unable to provide evidence," Bailey said.
