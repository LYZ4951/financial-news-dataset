March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

This announcement corrects the version published 4  March 2014, which incorrectly affirmed Friary No.1 Plc's class A1 notes. These  notes paid in full on 22 July 2013. Fitch Ratings has affirmed First Flexible 4 Plc (FF4), First Flexible 7 Plc  (FF7) and Friary No.1 plc (Friary) and upgraded eight tranches of Brunel  Residential Mortgages Securitisation No.1 plc (Brunel). A full list of rating  actions is at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Divergence in Asset Performance  FF4, Friary and Brunel have shown healthy performance with loans in arrears by  more than three months (3M+) at 0.2% (FF4), 0.7% (Friary) and 1.7% (Brunel) of  the outstanding pool balance and loans with properties in possession at 0.1% for  Friary and Brunel and 0.4% for FF4. In contrast, for FF7, 3M+ arrears stood at  3.5% of current pool balance and loans with properties in possession at 2% (only  two loans amounting to GBP1m).  The higher level of arrears and loans in possession in FF7 is partially  attributable to the higher interest rates payable by borrowers. The portfolio is  earning a weighted average (WA) yield of 4.98% compared with the current WA  yield for FF4 of 2.3%. In addition, 89% of FF4's current portfolio is buy-to-let  (BTL) loans and only 5% for FF7. Paragon's extensive use of its receiver of rent  policies, applicable only to BTL mortgages, has also contributed towards the  better performance of FF4 compared with FF7. Given the current low pipeline of defaults for FF4, Friary and Brunel, Fitch  expects repossessions and associated losses to remain minimal in the coming  year, while the high level of excess spread in FF7 (annualised at 3.3%) is  expected to remain sufficient to cover any future losses from the sale of  properties taken into possession as the high seasoning of the underlying  mortgages and the resulting low indexed current loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of  18% in FF7 (50% in FF4) is expected to result in limited losses. Prior to 15 November 2013, both the FF4 and FF7 portfolios comprised loans with  flexible features whereby borrowers were able to redraw on past overpayments.  The removal of this feature and subsequent cancellation of the respective redraw  facilities provided by Barclays has no rating impact on the notes. Strong Credit Enhancement (CE) Supports Upgrade  The robust performance of Brunel 1 has enabled pro-rata amortisation of the  notes to continue, benefiting the junior notes of the capital structure.  Subsequently, the build-up of CE for Brunel's rated notes to more than double  that at closing has led to the upgrade of the class B, C and D notes by one  notch. Furthermore, given fully funded non-amortising cash reserves for all four  transactions, we expect a further build-up in CE as the notes continue to pay  down.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The reserve funds in FF4 and FF7 are held with Barclays (A/Stable/F1). As the  respective reserve funds are the sole form of credit support for the most junior  tranches in both transactions, a default of the account bank could lead to  payment interruption risks and subsequently have a negative impact on the notes'  ratings.
