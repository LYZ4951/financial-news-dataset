March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Penarth Master Issuer plc's  series 2014-1 notes, backed by UK credit card receivables originated by the Bank  of Scotland plc [LLOYBS.UL] (BoS; A/Stable/F1) and Lloyds Bank plc [BACXL.UL] (Lloyds; A/Stable/F1), expected ratings as follows:   Series 2014-1 A1: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable Series 2014-1 A2: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable The final ratings on the new notes are contingent on the receipt of final  documentation conforming to information already reviewed, including the issue  amounts. Fitch has also reviewed and affirmed the ratings of the six outstanding  Fitch-rated tranches of the Penarth master trust programme, as follows:  GBP300m Series 2010-2 A3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP125m Series 2011-1 A2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable USD750m Series 2013-1 A1 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP1,300m Series 2013-1 A2: affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP200m Series 2010 B1 affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP330m Series 2010-2 B1 affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS Firm Asset Performance Fitch's base case charge-off expectation remains unchanged at 7.5% for the  Penarth trust, which is at the midpoint of the range of 4.5% to 10% assigned in  similar transactions. The agency's base case assumptions for the trust's monthly  payment rate (18%) and yield rate (16%) also remain unchanged since the most  recent performance review in November 2013.   Originator Linkage Due to the revolving nature of the underlying assets, relative to the amortising  receivables, asset performance is closely linked to the performance of the  originator. Fitch conducted an annual review of the underwriting and servicing  processes at BoS and Lloyds in December 2013 and found both the policies and  procedures satisfactory, as were implementation and controls.   Interchange Cap Impact Fitch has expected regulatory pressure on interchange fees for some time and  therefore the agency has not given full credit to interchange revenue when  setting its base case yield assumption, as denoted in the Credit Card ABS Rating  Criteria and in previous reports. Further EU regulation is expected to reduce  the cap on interchange fees to 0.3% (the current UK level is 0.9%) of transacted  amounts and is due to come into force from 3Q15 in the UK. No additional yield  stress was applied in the analysis, as the impact of the cap will also depend on  any second-order effects on cardholder composition, payment behaviour and any  countermeasures originators might implement. Fitch will continue to assess any  downward pressure on yield as a result of regulatory and competitive forces.  Stable Asset Outlook The performance for credit card trusts continued to improve throughout 4Q13,  with charge-off, delinquency and payment rates improving, while yield rates were  stable over the same period. Fitch revised up its GDP forecast to 2.5% for 2014 and 2015 from 2.3% for both  years in the December Global Economic Outlook. The agency believes annual UK  unemployment rates for 2014 and 2015 will continue to drop from their current  level of 7.2% (December 2013), to 6.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Fitch therefore  maintains its stable outlook for UK credit card trusts throughout 2014.
