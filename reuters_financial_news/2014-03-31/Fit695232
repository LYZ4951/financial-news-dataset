March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Reserve Bank of India's [RBIND.UL] (RBI) recent delay of Basel III  implementation offers Indian banks' more time to meet the minimum capital  requirements, Fitch Ratings says. This could particularly benefit some  state-owned banks facing capital pressure. The main benefit from the one-year moratorium will be the delay in the phase-in  of the capital conservation buffer from end-March 2016 (FY16, which starts 1  April 2016), instead of FY15, as most other parameters remain the same. More  importantly, banks would get some crucial breathing space from the lower 5.5%  pre-specified capital trigger on additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities until FY19  when it reverts to 6.125%. The headroom of 0.625% will be particularly helpful  for mid-sized state-owned banks where capital buffers are particularly  challenged. We believe RBI's actions are a tacit recognition of the potential difficulty  state-owned banks would have faced in meeting full capital requirements under  the previous timelines. State-owned banks still need the lion's share of the  estimated total core capital requirement for the system, but have thus far  largely relied on the government for new capital because of low internal capital  generation and weak access to equity markets. The RBI has also provided additional clarity on Basel III capital instruments  and their behaviour, particularly on the issue of loss absorbency.  The  exclusion of temporary write-downs on Basel III capital instruments reinforces  the regulator's intent to ensure capital securities act like equity when  required under stress.  The flipside though is that greater loss absorbency would come at the cost of  being less investor friendly. AT1 securities are expected to shoulder a large  share of the capital burden and investor appetite is currently limited adding to  the capital raising challenges.
