TOKYO, March 31 (Reuters) - Japanese private equity firm Unison Capital Inc said a new fund worth close to $600 million will target mainly smaller, nimble consumer goods and services companies that have bigger growth potential than Japan's established corporate giants.

Unison, which now manages one of the largest private equity funds among Japanese buyout firms, is raising 60 billion yen ($583 million) for its fourth fund. The investment period for its third fund expires in August. Tatsuo Kawasaki, a partner at Unison Capital, said in an interview on Monday that the firm plans to use the fund to make around eight to 10 investments, targeting companies whose enterprise value is between around 10 billion yen and 30 billion yen. "We have made this target because we have learned from our past experiences that companies in this size are easier to work with," said Kawasaki. "When you compare a company with 100 workers and 1,000 workers, it's easier to improve inefficiencies at a smaller company. The business structure is less complicated and revenue stream can be improved faster." Unison has previously been involved in larger deals, like an investment with Carlyle Group <CG.O> in a semiconductor wafer maker business which was spun off from Toshiba Corp <6502.T> in 2006.  Kawasaki said Unison will mainly target companies like retailers and consumer goods firms. One of Unison's most successful deals to date is the divestment of sushi restaurant chain Akindo Sushiro Co, sold in 2012 to global buyout firm Permira [PERM.UL] for about $1 billion - eight times the value of the restaurant company's equity when Unison invested.   He also said companies which largely rely on domestic revenue are preferred. Kawasaki said now is a good time to make investments in Japan as the economy begins to recover after decades of deflation.  "We are a long-term investor so it is always good to make investments when the value of assets is rising," the Unison partner said.  That trend has been stoked by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government spending and the Bank of Japan's flood of cash into financial markets, weakening the yen and boosting profits at Japanese exporters.  Despite the government measures, dubbed "Abenomics", Japanese companies are not growing rapidly, Kawasaki said.  "Particularly small and medium-sized companies have limited management resources. They usually do not have enough ideas or even if they do have ideas, they do not have people to execute it," Kawasaki said. "Our role is to provide expertise and financing to such companies."
