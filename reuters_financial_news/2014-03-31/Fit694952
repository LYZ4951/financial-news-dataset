March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to rate John Deere Owner Trust  2014 as follows:  --$308,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf'; --$292,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$313,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$94,165,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$ 25,829,050 certificates Not Rated.  Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the presale  report titled 'John Deere Owner Trust 2014', dated March 31, 2014, which is  available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the link below.   KEY RATING DERIVERS High Concentration of AG Equipment: JDOT 2014 is the sixth transaction to  contain 75% AG equipment. Although AG equipment historical losses have been low,  a high concentration in the pool limits diversification and exposes the trust to  other factors, such as natural disasters (e.g. droughts and floods). However,  geographic diversity and equipment versatility helps to mitigate the high  concentration.  Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 75.26% AG and 24.74% CO  equipment. These concentrations are consistent with those of JDOT 2013-B.  Furthermore, the pool consists of 66.04% annual-pay contracts, which  historically have experienced a lower level of losses versus other payment  types. Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for JDOT  2014 is 3.50%, unchanged from JDOT 2013-B. The initial reserve in JDOT 2014 is  1.00%, while the subordinated certificates provide 2.50% enhancement. Initial  excess spread in JDOT 2014 is expected to be approximately 2.05%, down from the  JDOT 2013-B transaction (2.11%). Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: JDCC has demonstrated strong  capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical  delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and its managed  portfolio. All securitizations issued and rated by Fitch have performed within  initial base case expectations.  Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should  provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of  payments on the securities.  RATING SENSITIVITY  Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on  defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and  could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the  sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JDOT 2014 to increased cumulative net  losses (CNL) over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the  transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and CNL, showing a  potential downgrade of one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss)  scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating  categories, although still remaining investment grade, under Fitch's severe  (2.5x base case loss) scenario.   Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the  accompanying pre-sale report.
