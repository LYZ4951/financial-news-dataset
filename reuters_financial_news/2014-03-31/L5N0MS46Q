MILAN, March 31 (Reuters) - Italian property firm Risanamento <RN.MI> said on Monday a Milan judge had rejected a legal challenge from a group of companies led by its former owner Luigi Zuino aimed at blocking a vital sale of prized French assets.

Debt-laden Risanamento has accepted a 1.2 billion euro ($1.7 billion) offer by Britain's Chelsfield Partners for nine high-end properties in the heart of Paris.  Following Zunino's move, Chelsfield had said it was ready to keep the deal on hold until April 4.
