March 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ooredoo Q.S.C's <ORDS.QA> (Ooredoo)  Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' with Stable  Outlook. Qtel International Finance Limited's [QTEL.UL] global medium-term note programme  and Ooredoo Tamweel Limited's Sukuk programme have also been affirmed at 'A+'. Ooredoo's IDR is notched down from Fitch's credit assessment of the State of  Qatar on a top-down basis, reflecting strong legal, operational and strategy  ties between the two. This is in accordance with the agency's Parent and  Subsidiary Linkage criteria. The State of Qatar, directly and indirectly owns  69% of Ooredoo.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  State Support Ooredoo's ratings reflect Fitch's assessment of the State of Qatar's  creditworthiness due to strong operational and strategic ties. Strong ties are  supported by the ownership of a golden share of Ooredoo by the Qatari  government. This implied state support underpins the strong ratings and offsets  risks associated with diversification into weaker-rated emerging markets,  slowing sector growth and M&A risk.  Limited Growth Prospects In line with Fitch's expectations, Ooredoo's revenue grew by a modest 1% in  FY13, due to maturing mobile markets, increasing competition and changes to the  technology landscape. The company has responded by shifting its strategy towards  efficiency improvements and focusing on data services, which should help  stabilise operating margins in the medium-term. Nevertheless, Fitch expects  pressure in this area to continue over the short- to medium-term with no revenue  growth and EBITDA margins under pressure at low 40%-41% on a group basis.Emerging Markets Exposure  Ooredoo generates approximately 22% of its consolidated EBITDA from Qatar (excl.  eliminations) and we expect contribution from the domestic business to remain  around 20% in the coming years. Other GCC countries, mainly Oman and Kuwait,  account for 10.5% of the group's consolidated EBITDA, with the remainder being  derived from Indonesia, Iraq, Algeria and Tunisia. Ooredoo's operations in these  lower-rated countries continue to generate stronger headline growth than the  domestic market, but are exposed to higher political and economic risks.  Currency fluctuations and access to cash of operating subsidiaries domiciled in  some weaker-rated countries could prove challenging under adverse political  circumstances.  Conservative Leverage Profile Expected Ooredoo's consolidated leverage guidance is 1.5-2.5x net debt/EBITDA. The  group's leverage remained within this level at end-2013 and Fitch expects this  to be the case in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Fitch recognise that  this ratio can fluctuate quite significantly within these limits, depending on  any large scale M&A. Fitch, however, believes that if the group breaches these  levels and struggles to deleverage within a short forecast period (12 months),  equity support from the State of Qatar would be forthcoming to place leverage  levels on a more stable footing.  M&A Risk and Increasing CAPEX  Fitch estimates that the awarded Myanmar's license will require significant  amounts of investments over 2014-2016. Ooredoo indicated in Q1 its plans to  invest USD1bn to cover license cost, capex and opex requirements for 2014. As  this is a greenfield network roll-out, any material positive contribution to the  group's EBITDA is unlikely over the medium-term. The new license is also much  smaller in terms of scale than the recently withdrawn bid for Maroc Telecom.  Adequate Liquidity Profile Fitch expects liquidity to remain adequate for the current ratings, underpinned  by the company's large cash balance of USD5.6bn (QAR20.3bn) at FYE13. The  company has recently been active in the bond and Sukuk markets extending overall  debt maturities, with 63% of debt maturities now due beyond 2016. Future  short-term debt maturities in 2014-2015 will be comfortably met with internal  cash flows and cash on balance sheet.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: - Positive change in the sovereign rating  Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: -A downgrade of the sovereign rating or any change in the implied support,  commitment, importance to and ownership by the State of Qatar, which would  prompt a review of the ratings
