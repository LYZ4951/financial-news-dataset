WARSAW, March 31 (Reuters) - Visa <V.N> Europe will cut the rate it charges for card transactions in Poland, also known as the interchange rate, to 0.5 percent from 1.2 to 1.3 percent, the payments company said on Monday.

The reduction will come into force from July 1, Visa added. The cut in the rate was forced by a law that came into effect this year and will increase pressure on the financial results of banks that receive part of the proceeds, analysts said.
