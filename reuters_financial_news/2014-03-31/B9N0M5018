BEIJING, March 31 (Reuters) - China granted $85.9 billion in fresh quotas to licensed overseas institutional investors in March, data released on Monday by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) showed.

A sum of $53.6 billion was issued under the dollar-denominated Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme, with 200.5 billion yuan ($32.3 billion) issued under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) programme. Institutional investors need to apply for a licence from the securities regulator to seek investment quotas from the foreign exchange regulator. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a graphic on China's QFII approvals, click: http://link.reuters.com/fyp24v
