LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - Russia's dollar debt fell and debt insurance costs rose on Monday on concern about sanctions against Russia due to increasing tensions over Ukraine.

Russia's 5-year credit default swaps rose 18 basis points from Friday's close to 2-1/2 month highs of 228 bps, according to Markit. Russia's <XS086198118=TE> dollar bond due 2022 fell 1 point from Friday's close to its lowest since early may at 84, according to Tradeweb. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement on Monday that increasingly intense fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine was extremely alarming and the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner on July 17 may amount to a war crime.
