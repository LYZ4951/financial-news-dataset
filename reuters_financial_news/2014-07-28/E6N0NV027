BUENOS AIRES, July 28 (Reuters) - Argentina on Monday paid the Paris club a first $642 million tranche as part of a deal to clear its debts with the wealthy club of creditor nations, the economy ministry said.

"In this way, Argentina continues its path of resolving the international liabilities produced by the 2001 default," the ministry said in a statement.
