PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - French department store Galeries Lafayette said on Monday it had sold its 50 percent holding in LaSer, a consumer credit company, to the personal finance unit of BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, with which it co-owned the unit.

A source close to the deal said the two parties had been discussing the sale of LaSer for two years and finally agreed on a valuation for the whole company of around 280 million euros ($376.4 million).
