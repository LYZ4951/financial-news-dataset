SAO PAULO, July 28 (Reuters) - Cielo SA <CIEL3.SA>, Brazil's largest card payment processor, posted the slowest profit expansion in a year in the second quarter as rising expenses offset robust volume growth and revenue from prepayments, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

Second-quarter results may mark the start of a new cycle of  headwinds for Cielo, whose stock has been a favorite among financial industry analysts for the past two years. Cielo unveils earnings late on Tuesday. Management will discuss the results with investors at a conference call the following day. Regulators could end the remaining exclusivity agreements in the sector, dampening future revenue sources. Concern is growing that expenses per transaction will rise going forward, and that competition from the payment processors controlled by lenders Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA> and Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA> next year will intensify, the poll found. Net income at the Barueri, Brazil-based company rose a meager 0.1 percent to 807 million reais ($363 million) on a quarter-on-quarter basis, according to the average estimates of seven analysts in the poll. On an annual basis, profit swelled 29.4 percent, the poll found. "Although not as great as in previous quarters, momentum should sustain Cielo as a good defensive play," said Victor Schabbel, an analyst with Credit Suisse Securities. Net revenue probably rose 8 percent to 1.963 billion reais, with higher transaction volumes for debit and credit card payments as well as more equipment rentals propelling revenue gains, the poll found. Prepayment of receivables for large retailers also propped up sales, the poll showed. Rising expenses drove earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profitability known as EBITDA, down 1.1 percent to 991 million reais in the quarter, according to the poll. EBITDA fell to an average 53.4 percent of net revenue in the quarter, from 55.1 percent in the previous three months. Higher cost of goods sold stemmed from a jump in transaction volumes, Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts led by Carlos Macedo said. Combined costs and expenses inched higher to 0.72 reais per transactions, up 3.6 percent on a quarterly basis. The following are forecasts on Cielo's earnings.
