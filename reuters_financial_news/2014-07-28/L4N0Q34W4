July 28 (Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc <DRI.N> said Clarence Otis would step down as chairman and chief executive, buckling under pressure from activist investors Barington Capital Group LP and Starboard Value LP.

Darden, whose shares rose 4.6 percent after the bell, also  said it would separate the two roles. Otis, who has been at the helm for a decade, will remain as CEO until a successor is appointed or until year-end.
