July 28 (Reuters) - Banks will take up most of the new cheap cash that will be offered by the European Central Bank in September and December through its initial targeted long-term loans, a Reuters poll of euro money market traders found.

The initial Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLRTOs) worth roughly 400 billion euros in September and December will then be followed by further loans every three months until June 2016, the ECB has said. Euro money market traders polled on Monday expected strong demand at the first two auctions - a total of 363 billion euros - but said the moves would not materially boost lending in the euro zone, at least not enough to satisfy the ECB. "More cheap cash, bring it on," said a trader at a large dealer. "All that these loans will do is add more liquidity in the system." Facing dangerously low inflation, now at 0.5 percent, the ECB announced several policy measures last month with the aim of getting inflation back up to the 2 percent target. These measures included cutting the deposit rate below zero and offering new long-term funding, as it has done before, except now with a condition that banks use some of the cash to lend to the real economy. A Reuters poll of economists and market watchers conducted immediately after the ECB announced those measures also concluded that they were not likely to materially boost lending to the private sector or boost inflation. [ID:nL5N0OR41N] What they will do, traders said, is add more liquidity to the system. But traders polled over the past several months each week have said additional liquidity is not required. Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - has fallen close to 100 billion euros as banks have repaid more than half of the more than one trillion euros of funds they borrowed from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012. Those three-year loans, called LTROs, were offered in December 2011 and February 2012 to avert a credit crunch at the peak of the euro zone debt crisis and came with no requirement to lend money back to the private sector. However, the fall in excess liquidity as a result of the repayment of those crisis loans has not pushed interbank lending rates higher, suggesting that banks in the euro zone, especially  in the peripheral countries, still rely on the ECB for funding. Early repayments of the crisis loans have also picked up pace as banks are going through the ECB health checks, which are entering their final stages with the results due in October. Banks are now expected to repay another 3.5 billion euros early of those loans next week, slightly more than the 3.0 billion euros they will pay back this week. [ID:nZYN2D8600] The regular survey showed the ECB will allot 100.0 billion euros at its weekly tender and 11.0 billion euros at its three-month operation, compared to 97.9 billion and 13.2 billion euros maturing this week respectively.
