HONG KONG, July 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index finished at its highest level in more than three years on Monday, as Chinese banks jumped after a Reuters report said the country's fifth-biggest bank by assets planned to seek more private investors.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.9 percent at 24,428.63 points, its strongest since November 2010. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong climbed 0.7 percent at its highest close since December 11.  China's Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom) <3328.HK> plans to sell stakes to private investors under a government reform aimed at letting private capital play a bigger role in the economy, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. [ID:nL4N0Q037S] The bank's Hong Kong listing jumped 6.2 percent to an almost 8-month high, leading gains on the Hang Seng. Other Chinese banks were broadly stronger, with the "Big Four" state banks adding 1 to 3 percent.  The sector was further supported by the issuance of preference shares by the country's biggest lender Industrial And Commercial Bank Of China <1398.HK>, which helped relieve fears of dilutive common capital raisings as Chinese banks rush to replenish their balance sheets to meet new global rules.
