July 28 (Reuters) - Hiscox Ltd <HSX.L> posted a 31 percent fall in first-half profit as the Lloyds of London insurer and reinsurer continued to feel the pinch of declining reinsurance rates and recorded a foreign exchange loss compared with a gain a year earlier.

Profit fell to 124.6 million pounds ($211.6 million) from 180.7 million pounds a year earlier. [ID:nRSb4218Na] Net premiums earned rose 2.5 percent to 643.5 million pounds. The underwriter, which insures risks ranging from oil rigs to kidnappings, fine art, property and vintage cars, said a benign claims environment was masking an underlying deterioration in rates.
