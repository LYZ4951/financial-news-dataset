MADRID, July 28 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> said on Monday says it had agreed to sell its debt recovery business to Lindorff Espana, part of Norwegian credit manager Lindorff, for 162 million euros ($217.6 million).

The deal comes as many international private equity firms and investment groups jostle for a slice of the debt recovery industry in Spain, as banks get rid of soured loans accumulated during the financial crisis.
