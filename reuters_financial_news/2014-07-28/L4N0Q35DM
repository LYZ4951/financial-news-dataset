SYDNEY, July 29 (Reuters) - Australia's QBE Insurance Group <QBE.AX> said on Tuesday its insurance profit margin is likely to be around 7 percent to 8 percent compared with consensus expectations of around 10 percent, hit by higher claims, largely in Argentina.

The group's operating ratio - its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue - is expected to rise to 96 percent to 97 percent compared with consensus expectations of around 93 percent, it said.
