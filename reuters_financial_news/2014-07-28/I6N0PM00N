MILAN, July 28 (Reuters) - Italy's tax police has seized 104 million euros ($140 million) from international bank Nomura <9716.T> for alleged fraud against the Sicily region in relation to past securitisation and debt restructuring deals, police said in a statement on Monday.

Nomura said in a separate statement it was aware of the action taken by prosecutors in Sicily, which it said related to trades entered into by Nomura and the Region of Sicily between 2000 and 2006.
