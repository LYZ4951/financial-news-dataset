COPENHAGEN, July 28 (Reuters) - Danish homeowners cut their borrowing from the country's vast mortgage credit institutes over the last year, opting instead for bank loans to finance their homes, new data showed on Monday.

Overall borrowing at mortgage institutes fell by 0.9 billion Danish crowns ($162.18 million) to 1,445.3 billion in the 12 months to the end of June, the first decline since the Danish Mortgage Banks' Federation began compiling the data in 2007. "This will go into history as the time when the competition moved housing loans from the mortgage sector to the banking sector," the federation's Chief Executive Karsten Beltoft said in a statement. Sweden's Svenska Handelsbanken <SHBa.ST>, which attracts cheap funding thanks to its strong credit rating, has grown its Danish business by offering competitive bank loans for homeowners. Meanwhile, mortgage credit institutes can only lend up to 80 percent of the value of a home, blocking access to the market for some of those hit by the sharp decline in the Danish property market during the financial crisis. Banks are not subject to the same restriction. "Some home owners that used to have a mortgage have switched to a bank loan, Nordea Chief Analyst Lise Nytoft Bergmann said. Denmark's $500 billion mortgage bond market traces its origins back to 1795, when Copenhagen was rebuilt after a fire. The top issuer in the market is Nykredit [FRNYKR.UL], but top banks Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>, Nordea <NDA.ST> and Jyske Bank <JYSK.CO> also have significant mortgage credit units. Monday's data also showed that the Danes increasingly opt out of interest-only and one-year adjustable-rate loans.
