BANGKOK, July 28 (Reuters) - Thailand's stock index snapped a two-day rising streak, while the Philippine benchmark slipped to a near two-week closing low amid weak economic data and holidays in Southeast Asia.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> fell 0.37 percent in a range-bound session dampened by trade data for June which showed imports tumbled sharply from a year earlier. [ID:nL4N0PX39S] Players sold recent gainers, including banks <.SETB>, switching to midcaps with strong growth prospects such as chicken exporter GFPT <GFPT.BK>. [ID:nL4N0Q31XL] The Philippine main index <.PSI> fell 0.6 percent to 6,850.47, the lowest close since July 15. Data showed the country's budget swung back to deficit in June. [ID:nP9N0NT018] Shares of holding firm Alliance Global <AGI.PS> and property firm Megaworld Corp <MEG.PS> were among the top losers due to foreign-led selling, according to exchange data. Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> fell 1.8 percent to its lowest since July 15, as investors sold shares before expected declines in the coming weeks, analysts said. [ID:nL4N0Q32AR] Singapore and Malaysia were closed on Monday. The Philippines will be closed on Tuesday, as will Malaysia. The Indonesian market will be closed for the entire week. [ID:nL4N0Q02XX]
