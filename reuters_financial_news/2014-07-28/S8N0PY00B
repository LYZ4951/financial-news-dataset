MADRID, July 28 (Reuters) - Spanish bailed-out lender Bankia <BKIA.MC> on Monday said its first half net profit more than doubled from a year ago to 432 million euros ($580 million), beating forecasts as bad debts fell slightly and lending revenue rose.

The bank, which is about 60 percent owned by the government, was expected to post a 399-million-euro profit in the period according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nL6N0Q04O7] Net interest income, what the bank makes on loans minus funding costs, was 1.43 billion euros in the first half, up 31 percent on the year-ago period.
