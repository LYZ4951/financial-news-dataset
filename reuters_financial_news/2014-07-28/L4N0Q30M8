MANILA, July 28 (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank is likely to continue its gradual policy tightening at a meeting on Thursday but economists in a Reuters poll were divided on exactly how it would do it and were split down the middle on whether it would raise its main rate.

Six out of the 12 forecast the central bank would raise the overnight borrowing rate <PHCBIR=ECI> for the first time in three years to head off inflation, lifting it 25 basis points to 3.75 percent. The other six said it would stick at a record low of 3.50 percent. However, the six who forecast no change, plus one of the six predicting an increase, thought the central bank would raise the rate on its special deposit accounts (SDAs) for the second straight meeting, lifting it 25 basis points to 2.50 percent. The SDAs are a facility where banks can park funds for between seven and 32 days. Raising the rate could make it more attractive for banks to leave money there, thereby draining liquidity from the system to ease inflationary pressure. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said on July 11 there was room for measured policy adjustments without hurting the economy. [ID:nL4N0PM0TT] The central bank has taken several modest steps this year to tighten liquidity and hold down price pressures, either by raising the rate on the SDAs or by raising bank's reserve requirements.
