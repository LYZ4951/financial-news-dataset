STOCKHOLM, July 28 (Reuters) - Swedish cable operator Com Hem <COMH.ST> is considering making an offer for Norwegian peer Get in the near future, Swedish business daily Dagens Industri reported late on Monday, citing sources.

Com Hem declined to comment on the report. In May, sources told Reuters Get's owners, Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and investment firm Quadrangle, had hired advisors for a possible stock market floatation of Get, saying an offering could value the firm at around 15 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.41 billion) including debt. [ID:nL6N0O62VJ] Com Hem was itself listed in Stockholm in June, in Sweden's largest initial public offering in 14 years.[ID:nL5N0OY0ZQ]
