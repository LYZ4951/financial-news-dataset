PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trade on Monday, regaining their poise after a drop in the previous session, with Ryanair <RYA.I> surging 5 percent after the airline boosted its annual profit outlook.

Europe's biggest budget airline lifted its outlook after posting a sharp rise in quarterly net income, coming in the wake of profit warnings by rivals Air France-KLM <AIRF.PA> and Lufthansa <LHAG.DE>. [ID:nL6N0Q30TX]
