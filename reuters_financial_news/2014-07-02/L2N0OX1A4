July 2(Reuters) - Argentina will press a U.S. judge to unfreeze a coupon payment to holders of the country's restructured debt as a condition for negotiating with 'holdout' creditors suing for full repayment, a government official said on Wednesday.

Latin America's No. 3 economy has been pushed to the brink of a fresh default by a string of U.S. court decisions that have forced it to negotiate with holdout investors who declined to restructure their bonds after the country's 2002 debt crisis.The following are key recent stories on the situation:LATEST NEWS > Argentina wants bond payment unfrozen if debt talks to go on   [ID:nL2N0PD0WW] > Holdout sees Repsol, Paris Club deals as model for talks   [ID:nL2N0PC129] > S&P places Argentina's foreign currency ratings on watch   [ID:nL4N0PC4S9] > Argentine debt battle could pressure world food prices higher  [ID:nL2N0P80SP] > Holdout bondholders say Argentina not at negotiating table [ID:nL2N0PB0RW] > U.S. judge says Argentine payment illegal, should be returned  [ID:nL2N0P80WL] > Argentina accuses U.S. judge of abusing power in debt case [ID:nL2N0P81TE] > Argentine debt battle could reduce global soybean supply   [ID:nL2N0P7241] > Argentina deposits debt payment, but U.S. court blocks payout  [ID:nL2N0P710U] > Argentina's Kicillof says nation being pushed toward default   [ID:nL2N0P60MH] > Argentina debt case's court appointee met with lawyers Tuesday [ID:nL2N0P620P] > UNCTAD: Ruling on Argentina debt doesn't comply with U.S. law  [ID:nL6N0P64UU] > Argentina debt holdouts: Would discuss extension in good faith [ID:nL2N0P51WC] > Argentina courts Europeans over debt saga with newspaper ads   [ID:nL6N0P51XV] > Argentina seeks U.S. court stay to avoid new debt crisis   [ID:L2N0P40KE] > Argentina's Fernandez willing to talk with all creditors   [ID:nL2N0P11AM] > S&P lowers Argentina's rating to CCC-  [ID:nL4N0OY3WA] > Argentina says next bond payment 'impossible,' default looms   [ID:nL2N0OZ0NE] > Argentina flirts with debt swap as fear of default rises   [ID:nL2N0OY1ZM] > U.S. high court rejects Argentina appeal   [ID:nL2N0OX0KJ] > Argentina gets wink, nudge from U.S. Supreme Court [ID:nL2N0OX0NX] > INSTANT VIEW-Argentina eyes new debt swap  [ID:nL2N0OY22F]COLUMNS/BREAKINGVIEWS > Judge in Argentina bond gives praise to lawyers[ID:nL2N0PB2S8] > Target for fixing Argentine bond mess looks small  [ID:nL2N0P414I] > Now Argentina wants to negotiate.
