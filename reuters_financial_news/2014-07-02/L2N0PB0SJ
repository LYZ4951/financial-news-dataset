July 2 (Reuters) - The following is a table with rankings for mergers and acquisitions activity in Brazil in the first half, as compiled by Thomson Reuters on Wednesday. [ID:nL2N0P71N7]

Mergers and acquisitions activity in Brazil will gain steam by year-end as economic and political risks ease, helping companies and private-equity firms looking for takeover targets sharpen their focus on the country's long-term potential. Companies announced about $28.328 billion worth of deals in Brazil in the year through June 30, up 34 percent from $21.006 billion a year earlier, a quarterly Thomson Reuters report on M&A activity showed on Wednesday. About 221 deals were announced in the first six months, down from 303 a year earlier.  -- RANKING VALUE INCLUDING NET DEBT OF TARGETFINANCIAL ADVISER VALUE OF VALUE OF PRIOR   DEALSDEALS   YEAR'S  (H1 2014)(H1 2013)   RANKING   1Banco Santander SA   $15.160 bln  $3.682 bln  7   2Rothschild   $12.956 bln  $1.522 bln  9   3 Itaú BBA$11.058 bln  $9.867 bln  1   4   Goldman Sachs Group   $9.026 bln   $4.985 bln  5   Inc5   Grupo BTG Pactual SA  $8.525 bln   $7.504 bln  3   6   Credit Suisse Group   $7.627 bln   $7.370 bln  4AG7  UBS AG $6.680 bln   $626.3 mln  12   8 Estáter Gestão e$5.422 bln  n.a.n.a.
