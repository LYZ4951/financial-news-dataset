CAIRO, July 2 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> remained stable at a central bank dollar sale and on the black market on Wednesday .

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, the same as its last sale on Monday. The bank's rates have stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after it had allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Wednesday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.38 pounds, in line with Tuesday's prices, but slightly stronger than Monday's rate of 7.40.
