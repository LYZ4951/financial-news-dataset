FRANKFURT, July 2 (Reuters) - British buyout group Charterhouse Capital [CHCAP.UL] is preparing a stock market listing of its German insulation materials firm Armacell, three people familiar with the plans said.

The private equity investor has asked investment banks to pitch for a role in the initial public offering (IPO) by next week, the sources said, adding an IPO could take place as early as the second half of 2014.  Armacell would be the second German building materials group to list this year after Braas Monier <BMSA.DE>, which on Wednesday traded 4 percent below its offer price. [ID:nL6N0P61YL] Armacell in 2013 posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of 65 million euros ($88.7 million) on sales of 510 million euros.  Peers such as Rockwool <ROCKb.CO> or Kingspan <KSP.I> trade at an average multiple of nine times their expected earnings.  If valued at a similar multiple, Armacell could be worth  more than 600 million euros in an IPO, although one source familiar with the plans said that Charterhouse was hoping to fetch a multiple of 11-12. Charterhouse, which last year bought Armacell from Bahrain-based private equity firm Investcorp [INBSCC.UL] for over 500 million euros, declined to comment.
