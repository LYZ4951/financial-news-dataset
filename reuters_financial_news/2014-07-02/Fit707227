July 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Da Vinci Synthetic plc's [DAVNS.UL]  notes, as follows:' EUR6.37m Class B: affirmed at 'CCCsf'; Recovery Estimate 90%. EUR7.74m Class C: affirmed at 'Dsf'; Recovery Estimate 0% The transaction is a synthetic securitisation of a portfolio of financial leases  and loans secured on aircrafts and associated aircraft collateral. Merrill Lynch  International Bank entered into a credit default swap with Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> under  which it sells protection on a reference portfolio of up to USD650m. All  financial leases or loan obligations (the reference portfolio) relate to the  financing or refinancing of aircrafts.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation is based on the current composition of the reference claims and  that no credit events have occurred in the past 12 months. Only one credit event  has occurred since the transaction closed in 2006. Fitch believes that the operating environment for the aviation sector is  challenging, in particular for European flagship carriers. This transaction is  exposed to concentration risk as the current portfolio contains 12 reference  claims involving five airlines in five countries. The top two airlines represent 61% of the total notional amount outstanding.  This number is expected to further increase by the end of October when all the  obligations related to one airline are repaid.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
