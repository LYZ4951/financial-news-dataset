MUMBAI, July 2 (Reuters) - Indian shares surged more than 1 percent to hit record highs on Wednesday after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's warning against "mindless populism" raised hopes the government would unveil a fiscally prudent budget next week.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally rose 1.27 percent to 25,841.21 points for a record closing high. Earlier, it surged as much as 1.37 percent to a record high of 25,864.53, surpassing its previous life high of 25,735.87 hit on June 11.
