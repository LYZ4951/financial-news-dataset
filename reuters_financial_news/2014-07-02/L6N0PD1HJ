EDINBURGH, July 2 (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Wednesday, following fresh highs in U.S. markets and a three-year peak for Asian stocks, though dashed hopes for deal-making in the French telecoms sector kept a lid on gains.

At 0711 GMT the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.2 percent at 1,384.89, with benchmark indexes in Germany, UK and Italy all in positive territory.  The French blue-chip CAC 40 <.FCHI> index, however, fell 0.1 percent, with Orange <ORAN.PA>, Bouygues <BOUY.PA> and Iliad <ILD.PA> down between 2.9 percent and 4 percent after Orange said on Wednesday it was dropping the idea of taking part in tie-ups in the French telecoms market. [ID:nWEB00P3Z] Telecom-equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent rose 4.6 percent, the top perfomer on the FTSEurofirst 300 index, after it was lifted to "overweight" from "neutral" by JP Morgan.
