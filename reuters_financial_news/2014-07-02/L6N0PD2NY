ROME, July 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's Targeted Longer Term Refinancing Operation (TLTRO), intended to encourage banks to increase lending to credit-starved companies, will be very successful in Italy when it begins in September, the head of the country's main banking association ABI said on Wednesday.

ABI President Antonio Patuelli said he had a "highly positive" view of the programme announced last month by ECB President Mario Draghi and believed it would be welcomed by Italian banks. "I am convinced that the experiment with these binding measures by the European Central Bank will be a success in the European Union and in Italy in particular," he told a meeting of the foreign press association in Rhome.
