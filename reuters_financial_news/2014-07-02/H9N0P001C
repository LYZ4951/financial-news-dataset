HONG KONG, July 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index climbed to its highest close in almost seven months on Wednesday, buoyed by upbeat China and U.S. data and an outperforming property sector.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> rose 1.6 percent at 23,549.62 points, the highest close since Dec. 10. Wednesday produced the biggest one-day gain in more than 7 weeks. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong gained 1.1 percent. Wednesday's gains also pushed the Hang Seng back into positive territory for the year, up 1.0 percent.  Manufacturing activity in China and the U.S. expanded in June, data showed on Tuesday, when Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday.
