ATHENS, July 2 (Reuters) - Private equity group Blackstone <BX.N> acquired a 10 percent stake in Greek real estate developer Lamda <LMDr.AT> for 20.2 million euros ($28 million), the latest move by foreign funds warming to Greece's recovery prospects, Lamda said on Wednesday.

Lamda Development said seven investment funds managed by Blackstone-GSO Capital Partners bought 4.44 million of its voting shares at 4.55 euros each - a 3.8 percent discount to the stock's closing price of 4.73 euros on Wednesday. Lamda was picked by Greece's privatisation agency in March  to develop a prime seaside property at the former Athens airport Hellenikon. Backed by China's Fosun <0656.HK> and Abu Dhabi-based property firm Al Maabar, the firm was the sole bidder for the project. [ID:nL5N0MS45G]
