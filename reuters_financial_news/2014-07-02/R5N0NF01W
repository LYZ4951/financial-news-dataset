SOFIA, July 2 (Reuters) - The turbulence in Bulgaria's banking system will not change Standard and Poor's sovereign credit rating on the country for now, the agency said on Wednesday.

It based its view on authorities' efforts to prevent the contagion from two bank runs in June from spreading. The Bulgarian government has freed up 3.3 billion levs ($2.30 billion) as a precautionary credit line in state aid to banks, following runs on Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> and First Investment Bank <5F4.BB>. The situation has since stabilised.
