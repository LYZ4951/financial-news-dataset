July 2 (Reuters) - Cloud service provider Rackspace Hosting Inc <RAX.N> may take itself private and is in talks with a private equity firm to fund the deal, technology blog TechCrunch reported on Wednesday, citing a source.

The company may make an announcement by this week, TechCrunch reported. (http://bit.ly/1xfbP4U) Rackspace, which leases server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud, had in May said it hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options, including partnerships and even a buyout. [ID:nL1N0O1287] The option of going private has come amid at least three acquisition bids, including those from Hewlett-Packard Co <HPQ.N> and IBM <IBM.N>, the tech blog said, citing a source within the company. Rackspace has faced stiff competition from newer startups as well as established players in the cloud computing business, such as Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and Google Inc <GOOGL.O>, which have slashed prices recently.
