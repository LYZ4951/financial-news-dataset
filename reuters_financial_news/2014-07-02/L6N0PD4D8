Visby, July 2 (Reuters) - Swedish centre-right government will in coming months unveil a new list of additional state-owned holdings in companies it will seek to sell during a possible third term in office, Finance Markets Minister Peter Norman said on Wednesday.

The government, which is trailing the opposition in opinion polls ahead of general elections in September, has sold state-owned firms such liqour maker Vin & Sprit, real estate group Vasakronan and a stake in bank Nordea <NDA.ST> over its past eight years in office. The governing four-party coalition is due to issue a joint election manifesto in August and will then present an updated list of companies they would look to sell, Norman said. "The list will consist of SAS, Telia and the postal service plus a few other companies," Norman said. He would not specify what other companies might be on the list. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's minority government has for years wanted to sell state holdings in airline SAS <SAS.ST>, telecom operator TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST> and the postal service, which was merged with its Danish peer in 2009 to form PostNord AB, in which Sweden owns a 60 percent stake. But the sale of its shares in SAS has been effectively put on ice as the airline has struggled to contend with fierce competition while a parliamentary majority has blocked any deals for TeliaSonera and the postal service.
