July 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Argentum Capital S.A.'s EUR50m Series 2014-37 secured repackaged notes, due 2019 (ISIN XS1076509972) a 'BBBsf' rating with Stable Outlook.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating addresses the timely payment of interest on the notes according to  the terms and conditions of the documentation, as well as the repayment of  principal by legal final maturity in September 2019. The rating reflects the  credit quality of two risk-presenting entities, as well as the legal and  financial structure of the issuer. The two risk-presenting entities are Credit  Suisse International [CSFBIL.UL] (A/Stable/F1) and Italy (BBB+/Stable/F2).  At closing on 2 July 2014, the proceeds from the note issue were used to  purchase an Italian government inflation-linked bond (ISIN IT0004380546) and to  enter into an asset swap with Credit Suisse International. The swap counterparty  claims will rank senior to noteholders except where Credit Suisse International  (as swap counterparty) is the defaulting party. The asset swap pays annually a  fixed rate coupon of 2.25% in return for the interest receipts on the Italian  government bonds the coupon of which is 2.35% and paid semi-annually. The notes  are secured by the Italian government bonds.  The notes are issued by Argentum Capital S.A., a programme arranged by Credit  Suisse International with limited liability and incorporated under Luxembourg  law. Non-petition language included in the master programme agreements warrant  that no party to any series will be able to petition for the winding-up of the  issuer as a consequence of the default of any particular series. In addition,  limited recourse clauses in the programme restrict the noteholder of any other  series to only have recourse to the collateral assigned to this series.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
