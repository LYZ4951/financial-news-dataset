JUBA, July 2 (Reuters) - South Sudan plans to borrow 3 billion pounds, about $1 billion at the official rate, from oil firms during the financial year 2014/15 to help cover repayments due on domestic loans and previous oil advances, the government said in a budget document.

It expects revenues of 11.553 billion pounds for the fiscal year starting in July, with about three quarters of that forecast to come from oil earnings, said the text of the finance minister's speech dated June 25. A lawmaker said it was presented to parliament on Wednesday.
