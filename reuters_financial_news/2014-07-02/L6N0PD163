DUBAI, July 2 (Reuters) - Commercial Bank of Qatar <COMB.QA> will buy out the remaining publicly owned shares in Turkey's Alternatifbank <ALNTF.IS> and then delist the lender from the Istanbul bourse, it said on Wednesday.

The second-largest lender in Qatar bought a 74.25 percent stake in the Turkish bank last year. Two units of Anadolu Holding own 25 percent, with the remaining 0.75 percent held by the public. [ID:nL6N0HR27S]
