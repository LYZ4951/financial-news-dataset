NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's water utility plans to raise funds for capital improvements as early as September this year, either by going to market or via private placement, the agency head told to Reuters on Wednesday.

The agency could raise $400 million to $600 million, said Alberto Lazaro Castro, executive president of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority, or PRASA.  "We would like to get it by September, October of this year," he said. PRASA, along with other public corporations in Puerto Rico, has seen its credit rating slashed and its debt dumped this week after investors were spooked by a new law allowing those agencies to restructure their debt. Mutual funds holding about $1.7 billion of its debt sued the commonwealth on Monday, while investors sold off many of the island's bonds.

"Although it (the law) applies to PRASA, PRASA will have no need to use it in the foreseeable future because we have sufficient revenues to cover all our debt (servicing) and all our operating expenses," he said.  Other agencies affected by the law include the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and the Puerto Rico Highway & Transportation Authority (PRHTA).  PREPA has about $8.8 billion of outstanding debt, according to a Commonwealth report issued last October. PRHTA has debt of $7.1 billion and PRASA has $4.6 billion. Emily Raines, Moody's Investors Service's lead analyst on Puerto Rico, separately said on Wednesday that PRASA and the highway authority both are in better liquidity positions than PREPA, but both still have substantial debt loads and additional financing needs looming. She estimated that PRASA would need to raise $300 million to $500 million later this year to finance capital projects to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency mandates. Moody's on Tuesday downgraded PRASA to Caa1 from Ba3. Standard & Poor's on Monday put PRASA under review for potential downgrade.[ID:nL4N0PC48T][ID:nL2N0PB0Z0] Puerto Rico itself was downgraded to junk by all three major rating agencies earlier this year.  Years of a declining population and shrinking economy have left Puerto Rico strapped for cash, saddling it with about $70 billion of debt and shrinking its revenue.
