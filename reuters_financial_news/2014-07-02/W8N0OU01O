WARSAW, July 2 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank on Wednesday dropped its forward guidance for flat rates to the end of the third quarter from its monthly statement and said inflation may stay very low in the coming months and may even temporarily fall below zero.

Earlier, the bank's Monetary Policy Council  decided to keep interest rates at their record-low level of 2.50 percent.
