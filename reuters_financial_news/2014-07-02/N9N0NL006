NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages dipped slightly last week as purchases slipped, an industry group said on Wednesday.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 0.2 percent in the week ended June 27. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose 0.1 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 0.7 percent.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GRAPHIC U.S. mortgage data: http://link.reuters.com/guv37s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.28 percent in the week, down 5 basis points from 4.33 percent the week before.
