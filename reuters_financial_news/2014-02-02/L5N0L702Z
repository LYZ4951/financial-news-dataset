DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Union National Bank <UNB.AD>, Abu Dhabi's fourth-largest lender by market value, said on Sunday its fourth-quarter net profit more than doubled from a year earlier, but the results still fell short of analysts' expectations.

The bank said in a bourse filing it made a fourth-quarter net profit of 306 million dirhams ($83.3 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, up from 136 million dirhams in the prior-year period. Six analysts forecast average net profit of 362.1 million dirhams in a Reuters poll. [ID:nL5N0KT05B] Full-year profit was 1.75 billion dirhams, compared to 1.6 billion dirhams in 2012.
