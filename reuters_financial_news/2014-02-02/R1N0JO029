ABU DHABI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said on Sunday he was pleased by the prospect of an investment by Abu Dhabi's Etihad in troubled Italian airline Alitalia and hoped a successful deal would be worked out.

The two companies announced earlier they were in the final phase of a due diligence process aimed at ensuring Alitalia <CAITLA.UL> could return to profitability and would work to try to finalise a common strategy over the next 30 days. "I am very happy with the announcement, we have worked for this outcome," Letta told reporters during a visit to Abu Dhabi.
