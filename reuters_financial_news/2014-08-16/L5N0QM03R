ZURICH, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The former head of Zurich Insurance <ZURN.VX> and lead director of Goldman Sachs <GS.N> James Schiro has died at the age of 68, the bank said.

The American citizen, who also served on the boards of Pepsico <PEP.N> and Reva Medical <RVALL.PK>, had retired from the bank's board in July after being diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.

Our thoughts are with his wife and children," Goldman Sachs said on its Twitter feed on Friday. In 2002, Schiro became the first non-Swiss to lead Zurich Financial Services, later renamed Zurich Insurance. He spent seven years at the top and helped restore the then troubled insurer back to profitability.
