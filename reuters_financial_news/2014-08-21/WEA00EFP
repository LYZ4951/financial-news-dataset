STOCKHOLM, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Policymakers in Sweden need to take further measures to deal with elevated household debt levels, particularly after the central bank cut rates in July, Riksbank First Deputy Governor Kerstin af Jochnick said on Thursday.

"It was necessary to cut the repo rate in July to attain the inflation target, but at the same time it is even more essential to take macroprudential policy measures to deal with household indebtedness," she said in a speech published on the central bank's website. She said that indicators published since the central bank cut rates by a half percentage point to 0.25 percent gave a mixed picture of the economy with weaker second quarter growth, but stronger unemployment and PMI figures.  "The indicators we have received regarding growth give slightly mixed signals," she said.
