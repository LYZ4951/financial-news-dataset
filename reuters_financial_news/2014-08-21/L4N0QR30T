HONG KONG, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The international banking industry has asked regulators for more time to implement derivatives rules that could add $800 billion to the global financial industry's cost of doing business, people familiar with the matter said.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), which represents the over-the-counter derivatives market, has written to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the global regulatory banking and securities bodies, requesting a delay to rules that aim to make trading derivatives safer, the people added. ISDA declined to comment on the content of the letter. IOSCO declined to comment. The BCBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The letter is the latest in a series of industry efforts to delay the implementation of the G20 post-crisis reform agenda, amid fears the new rules will dramatically overhaul bank business models.  ISDA is seeking a two-year delay to international rules that will require banks to secure OTC trades with collateral, such as bonds or equities.
