VIENNA, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Austria's Raiffeisen group is confident it will pass health checks being conducted of large European banks' balance sheets, its chief risk officer said on Thursday.

"Clearly," Johann Strobl told a news conference when asked if the group expected to pass a stress test whose results are due in October. The European Central Bank is leading Asset Quality Review (AQR) health checks of major euro zone banks, including Raiffeisen Bank International's <RBIV.VI> unlisted parent, Raiffeisen Zentralbank [RZB.UL].
