FRANKFURT, Aug 21 (Reuters) - German public-sector lender BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] said its strong capitalisation put it in a good position ahead of European Central Bank health checks of the financial sector.

"As at 30 June 2014, BayernLB has a very solid CET 1 ratio of 14.4 percent and is therefore well prepared for the ECB's asset quality review and subsequent bank stress test in the fourth quarter," BayernLB said in a statement on Thursday.
