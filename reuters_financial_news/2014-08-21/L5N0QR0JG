MOSCOW, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Russia's second-largest bank VTB <VTBR.MM> said on Thursday its first-half net profit fell 82 percent from a year ago, hit by a slowdown in the Russian economy and political tensions linked to the Ukraine crisis.

State-controlled VTB said in a statement that net profit was 5 billion roubles ($138 million) versus 27.6 billion roubles a year ago. Bad loan provisions rose to 92.8 billion roubles from 50.7 billion in the same period last year, hurting performance.
