SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, August 21 (Reuters) - Australian shares pared their gains on Thursday after a disappointing survey on Chinese manufacturing took much of the shine off a handful of strong earnings reports and Wall Street's upbeat performance.

The soft China economic report quickly ate into early gains that were spurred by minutes of the Federal Reserve's July meeting, which lifted U.S. stocks as investors were reassured that the central bank will retain its ultra-low interest rates for some time. Miners pulled back from morning highs as a preliminary private survey showed growth in activity in China's vast factory sector slowed to a three-month low in August as output and new orders lost steam.
