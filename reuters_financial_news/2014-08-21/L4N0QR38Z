BANGKOK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Stocks in Indonesia recouped early losses and closed near a 15-month high on Thursday ahead of a court ruling on the presidential election, while Thai shares edged up after the country's army chief was appointed prime minister.

Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE>, which measures the movement of 501 stocks, finished 0.3 percent higher at 5,206.14, its highest close since May 22, 2013 and just shy of the record close of 5,214.97 hit on May 20 last year. The benchmark lost almost 1 percent in early trading amid caution before the court verdict, but brokers said late buying reflected expectations of a ruling in favour of Joko Widodo.
