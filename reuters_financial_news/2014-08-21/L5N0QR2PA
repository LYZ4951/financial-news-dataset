LAGOS, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Nigeria sold 70.64 billion naira ($435 million) in treasury bills of three-month and six-month maturities at an auction on Wednesday, at similar yields it fetched at a previous auction this month, the central bank said on Thursday.

The central bank sold 40.64 billion naira in the 3-month paper at 9.9 percent, compared with 10 percent at the previous auction on Aug. 6, while it sold 30 billion naira in the 6-month debt note at 10.2 percent, same yield at the previous auction.
