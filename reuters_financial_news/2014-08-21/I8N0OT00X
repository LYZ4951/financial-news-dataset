MUMBAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Indian central bank reiterated on Thursday its commitment to bring down the consumer price index to 6 percent by January 2016, saying it was ready to use monetary policy to address high inflationary expectations and sticky core inflation.

Consumer price inflation (CPI) <INCPIY=ECI> has been consistently high in India due to elevated food prices, which is seen as disproportionately affecting poorer Indians.  CPI rose to a two-month high of 7.96 percent in July, with the core inflation at 7.4 percent. [ID:nL4N0QI391] "Such rigidity in core component of inflation points to the inertia nature of inflation feeding into the elevated inflation expectations, which would necessitate credible anti-inflationary monetary policy," the RBI said in its annual report out on Thursday. The RBI has previously said it aims to have CPI inflation fall to 8 percent by January 2015 and to 6 percent by January 2016.  For full report, see: http://bit.ly/1sWUKxm
