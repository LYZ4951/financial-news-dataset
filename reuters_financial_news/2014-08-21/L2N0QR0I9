NEW YORK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Esther George, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, said there was "every reason" for the U.S. central bank to start discussing normalization of monetary policy.

"There's every reason to think we should start talking about normalization," George said in an interview on Bloomberg Television from an annual meeting of top central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which starts Thursday. George cited progress in the U.S. unemployment rate and stable inflation as reasons to start discussing normalization of monetary policy.
