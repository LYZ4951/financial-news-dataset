Aug 21 (Reuters) - Quindell Plc <QPP.L>, a British IT outsourcing and consultancy services provider, said first-half adjusted pretax profit nearly tripled, boosted by a jump in sales at both its services and solutions businesses.

Adjusted pretax profit rose to 153.6 million pounds ($254.6 million) for the six months ended June 30, from 52.5 million pounds a year earlier, said Quindell, whose customers include British American Tobacco <BATS.L>, Aviva Insurance Plc <AV.L> and ING Groep NV <ING.AS>. [ID:nRSU6811Pa]
