WELLINGTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand consumer confidence fell for the first time in three months in August, a survey showed on Thursday, hitting a 10-month low with consumers less optimistic about their own position and the broader economic outlook.

The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index dropped to 125.5 from 132.7 in July. It hit a seven-year high of 135.8 in January. A reading above 100 shows optimism, while below 100 indicates pessimism. The survey showed consumers were not as positive about their own financial position, nor about the near- and longer-term economic outlooks. Expectations of consumer price inflation over the next two years eased to 3.3 percent from 3.9 percent in the previous survey.
