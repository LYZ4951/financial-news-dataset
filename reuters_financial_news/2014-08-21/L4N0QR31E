MUMBAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged higher on Thursday, gaining for seven out of eight previous sessions, as persistent buying by foreign investors continued to bolster blue chips such as State Bank of India <SBI.NS>.

The broader NSE index <.NSEI> has hit record highs in each of the previous three sessions, reflecting continued optimism about corporate earnings and a recovery in the domestic economy Good foreign buying has come despite an uncertain global environment, with data on Thursday showing China's vast factory sector slowed to a three-month low in August. [MKTS/GLOB] Overseas investors bought shares worth of $41.4 million on Wednesday, continuing their buying streak for the fifth straight session, exchange and regulatory data showed. They have bought a net $12.64 billion into Indian shares so far this year. "Markets are getting into the expiry mood as we are nearing the derivative contracts expiry. We will see stock-specific action. I feel enough money is waiting to enter into the market. It is a buy-on-dip market," said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research and chief strategist at SMC Global Securities Ltd. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 0.2 percent up at 7,891.10, not far off from the record high of 7922.70 hit on Wednesday.

State Bank of India closed 2.2 percent higher, while Bajaj Auto Ltd <BAJA.NS> ended 3.2 percent up and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd <SUN.NS> added 1.5 percent. State-run oil marketing companies have also gained on the back of weak crude prices.

[O/R] [ID:nL4N0QR1NQ] Indian Oil Corp Ltd <IOC.NS> gained 3.8 percent, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd <HPCL.NS> ended 4.4 percent higher and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd <BPCL.NS> added 2.8 percent.
