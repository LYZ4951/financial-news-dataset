NEW YORK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after a flurry of economic data showed an improving economy and as investors awaited the start of a central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

The S&P 500 climbed above its previous intraday record of 1,991.39, set on July 24, in Thursday morning trading. Investors are eyeing the benchmark index's approach to 2,000, a significant level it has yet to breach.  Market participants also refrained from making big bets on Thursday ahead of the start later today of the policymakers' meeting in Jackson Hole, which could provide clues on the timing of an interest-rate hike. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at the Jackson Hole conference on Friday.[ID:nL5N0QM0EA] "Overall, with the S&P reaching a new high and the Dow back above 17,000, you're seeing a bullish tone in the market," said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner at Mayflower Advisors in Boston. "But the real question will be, with the bullish economic data, will Yellen's comment in Jackson Hole remain as dovish as the market hopes it will be?" U.S. economic data, including a jump in existing home sales to a 10-month high and a sharp drop in initial jobless claims, pointed to an economy that is slowly gaining strength.
