CAIRO, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was stable at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday but weakened on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $37.4 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Wednesday. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed in a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.42 pounds, one market participant said, weaker than Wednesday's rate of 7.38/40. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of the central bank sales <EGYTV>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.
