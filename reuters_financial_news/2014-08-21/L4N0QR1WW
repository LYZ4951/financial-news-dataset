SEOUL, Aug 21 (Reuters) - South Korean shares tumbled 1.38 percent on Thursday, as a survey indicating weak growth in China's manufacturing sector fanned worries of a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <KS11> ended the day at 2,044.22 points. Institutional investors were sellers for a 10th consecutive session. They sold a net 324.6 billion won ($317.18 million) of shares, the biggest net sale in 2 1/2 months. The South Korean won <KRW=> edged lower as the dollar extended its rally to touch an 11-month high after hawkish undertones from the latest Fed meeting hinted at the possibility of an early rate hike. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,023.6 to the dollar at the conclusion of domestic trade.
