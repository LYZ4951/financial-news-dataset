DUBAI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - A court in Dubai's financial centre ruled in favour of Kuwait's Khorafi family in a suit against Switzerland's Bank Sarasin over about $200 million of investments that went bad, court officials said on Thursday.

The Dubai International Financial Centre court found Sarasin mis-sold unsuitable investments to family members in 2007 and 2008, and should pay compensation to the family, deputy chief justice John Chadwick said.
