LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Insurer Rothesay Life said on Thursday it has completed a 500 million pound ($828.95 million) buy-out of the Vestey Group's Western United group pension scheme.

In 'buy-out' deals, all liability for running a scheme is transferred to an insurance company. The buy-out was concluded with a 280 million pound bulk annuity, the insurer said in a statement, its third bulk annuity deal with the scheme.  The insurer earlier had secured over 220 million pounds of the scheme's liabilities. It is a defined benefit pension scheme for around 14,000 current and former employees and employers of the Vestey Group, a food and farming business. A shake-up of pension rules by the British government this year has led to insurers ramping up the number of retirement deals they sell to companies rather than to individuals. [ID:nL6N0NG2VV] Britain told retirees with pensions reliant on financial market returns, so-called defined contribution schemes, earlier this year that from April 2015 they would no longer have to buy an annuity, or income for life, at retirement.
