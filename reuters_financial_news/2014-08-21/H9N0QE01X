HONG KONG, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark share index posted its biggest daily loss in two weeks on Thursday, after a preliminary private survey showed growth in China's vast factory sector slowed to a three-month low in August, triggering broad profit-taking on recent gains.

The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 from July's 18-month high of 51.7, reinforcing concerns about increasing softness in the economy. The reading also missed a Reuters forecast of 51.5.[ID:nL4N0QQ1S4] The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.7 percent at 24,994.10 points in its worst day since Aug. 7. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong slid 1 percent to a two-week low.  Earnings remained the focus for many stocks.  China Resources Enterprise <0291.HK> closed provisionally down 2.9 percent after posting an 8.7 percent drop in first-half net profit on Thursday. The retail-focused conglomerate also said it expected losses from its joint venture with Britain's Tesco Plc <TSCO.L> to continue to impact the company. [ID:nL4N0QO33C]
