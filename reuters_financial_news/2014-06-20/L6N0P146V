VIENNA, June 20 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> said it was unaffected by a run on Corporate Commercial Bank <6C9.BB> in Bulgaria which prompted the Bulgarian central bank to take control of the country's fourth-largest lender on Friday. [ID:nL6N0P12PI]

"There is no impact on Raiffeisen Bank in Bulgaria," a spokesman for the Austrian bank said in Vienna. Raiffeisen, emerging Europe's second-biggest lender, said in its first-quarter report it was Bulgaria's sixth-biggest bank with a 2.4 billion euro ($3.26 billion) loan book and more than 740,000 customers.
