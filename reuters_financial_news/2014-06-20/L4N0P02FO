HONG KONG, June 20 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks bounced back on Friday as the beaten-down Macau gaming sector rebounded, but China shares looked set for their fourth straight losing session amid a spate of new intitial public offerings.

By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was up 0.2 percent at 23,218.86 points, but still down 0.4 percent on the week due to losses in the previous four days. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 0.5 percent. It has lost 1.1 percent on the week and is set for its first weekly loss in six.  On the mainland, the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings slipped 0.2 percent lower, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was down 0.5 percent at 2,013.09 points. The declines took their losses for the week to 2.8 and 2.4 percent, respectively, which would mark their worst week since April 25. The resumption of IPOs in the mainland has attracted huge demand after a four-month hiatus on offerings, locking up a large amount of funds and prompting investors to sell some of their other holdings to raise cash to chase the new listings. The first four companies to pursue listings attracted a combined 380 billion yuan ($61.20 billion) of bids, the China Securities Journal reported. Auto parts maker Shanghai Lianming Machinery <603006.SS> attracted interest around 515 times the amount on offer in the online portion of its sale.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission is planning about 100 IPOs for the rest of this year, its chairman said last month. Ten IPOs have been approved. [ID:nL3N0O53YV] Zheng added the index futures settlement was another factor in the drop of 1.6 percent on the Shanghai benchmark on Thursday. Among the biggest drags in Shanghai, Qingdao Haier <600690.SS> lost 3.8 percent, while Yonyou Software <600588.SS> dropped another 4.1 percent, following Thursday's plunge of the maximum allowed 10 percent, to a one-month low.  Gold shares rose, with Shandong Gold <600547.SS> and Zhongjin Gold <600489.SS> each up more than 2 percent. The safe-haven metal is set for its best week in three months on geopolitical tensions and a softer dollar. [ID:nL4N0P109N] In Hong Kong, Macau casinos were the biggest boosts to the Hang Seng. Sands China <1928.HK> rose 3.1 percent while Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> gained 2.7 percent.  China Oil and Gas Group <0603.HK> rose 1.5 percent to its highest since April 14, after the company announced acquisition of an oil and gas company in Canada. The sector has seen heavy selling in recent months on fears of slower revenue growth.
