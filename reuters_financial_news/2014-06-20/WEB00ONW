PARIS, June 20 (Reuters) - The French state has enough cash to fund the purchase of a 20 percent stake in Alstom <ALSO.PA> from conglomerate Bouygues <BOUY.PA> without selling other stakeholdings, a source in the Economy Ministry told Reuters on Friday.

The source added that the negotiations with Bouygues on the price of the stake were in the process of being finalised.
