SOFIA, June 20 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's stock exchange suspended Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> from trading until the end of the session on Friday, it said in a statement on its website, adding it would later assess the need to extend the suspension.

Adverse media reports triggered a run on the country's fourth largest lender this week, the central bank governor said on Friday, appealing to depositors to keep calm as the bank was not bankrupt.
