Kuala Lumpur's composite index <.KLSE> ended up 0.2 percent at 1,885.72, its highest since May 19, amid brisk buying in Sapurakencana Petroleum <SKPE.KL> and Sime Darby <SIME.BK>. Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> added 0.4 percent, with PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK> rising to a near-six-month high. An increase of $1/bbl in the average crude oil price above its base case of $105/bbl would boost PTTEP's earnings by 1.3 percent, broker CIMB said in a report. Malaysia ended the week 0.5 percent higher while Thailand notched up a 0.8 percent gain on the week. Others in Southeast Asia posted a weekly loss as tensions in Iraq weighed on broader sentiment.
