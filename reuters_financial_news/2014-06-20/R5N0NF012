SOFIA, June 20 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's central bank has put Corporate Commercial Bank <6C9.BB> under special supervision, withdrawn shareholders' rights and appointed special advisers to the bank, it said in a statement on Friday.

The central bank acted after it received information in a letter from Corporate Commercial bank on Friday morning that it had stopped all payments and stopped all types of bank operations due to a liquidity drain.
