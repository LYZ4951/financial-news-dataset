LISBON, June 20 (Reuters) - The Bank of Portugal wants the country's largest listed bank Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> to have a new CEO and a more professional team, with management changes expected soon, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.

"There was a meeting yesterday at the Bank of Portugal and there should be some changes in the bank's management, including the departure of the CEO. The Bank of Portugal wants a team that is perceived as more professional," one source said. The central bank team met with representatives of the Espirito Santo family that lost control of BES after a recent capital increase.
