June 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded the state-guaranteed long-term senior debt rating of National Bank of Greece <NBGr.AT> (NBG, B-/Stable), Alpha Bank <ACBr.AT> (Alpha, B-/Stable) and Eurobank Ergasias <EURBr.AT> (Eurobank, B-/Stable) to 'B' from 'B-'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.  The rating actions follow the upgrade of Greece's sovereign Long-Term foreign  currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) (see 'Fitch Upgrades Greece to 'B', Outlook  Stable' dated 23 May 2014 at www.fitchratings.com).   KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SENIOR DEBT The government-guaranteed debt issuances are senior unsecured instruments that  bear the full guarantee of the Greek state. Consequently, their ratings are the  highest of the issuer's Long-term IDR and Greece's Long-term foreign currency  IDR. Greek banks' government-guaranteed debt ratings are sensitive to any  changes to Greece's sovereign ratings.   The rating actions are as follows:  NBG: State-guaranteed debt (XS0945998499 and XS0920832846): upgraded to 'B' from 'B-' Alpha: State-guaranteed debt (XS1030829359): upgraded to 'B' from 'B-' Long-term guaranteed bond programme: upgraded to 'B' from 'B-' Short-term guaranteed bond programme: affirmed at 'B'  Eurobank:  State-guaranteed debt (XS0922876882): upgraded to 'B' from 'B-' Long-term guaranteed bond programme: upgraded to 'B' from 'B-'
