LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - Portugal's second largest listed bank Millennium BCP<BCP.LS> sees a "window" for a possible capital increase between now and August and will make a decision soon, chief executive Nuno Amado told Reuters on Friday.

"We will have to make a decision before the summer," Amado said in an interview in Lisbon, adding that August was the summer cutoff. "We know that there is a window, the fact that there is a window doesn't mean that we go through the window."  "We are doing a review to see if there is a better alternative than the current plan (which does not involve raising capital)."  Earlier in the week, Portuguese media reported that BCP had hired investment banks for a 2 billion euros ($2.73 billion)capital raise.  Amado would not comment on the size of any capital raise but said it would not be small.  The bank would use the money to accelerate repayment of 2.6 billion euros of state loans that are due to be repaid by early 2017, but Amado said the bank was not aiming to repay all the loans this year.  The CEO also said the bank had accelerated the sale of its Romanian business, where it has 477 million euros of loans, and its Portugal-based asset manager, and could close both later this year, ahead of an end-2015 deadline agreed with the European Commission.  The bank is awaiting full details of the European Central Bank's new 400 billion euros programme to encourage lending, and Amado said the facility could allow BCP to offer small businesses loans for longer terms at lower interest rates.
