HONG KONG, June 20 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares snapped a four-day losing steak, as the beaten-down Macau gambling sector rebounded, but still suffered a loss for the week.

The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong gained 0.4 percent, but had its 5-week winning streak ended with a 1.2 percent drop for the week.  Macau casinos were the biggest boosts to the benchmark index. Sands China <1928.HK> rose 2.3 percent and Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> gained 1.8 percent.
