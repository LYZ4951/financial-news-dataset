COPENHAGEN, June 20 (Reuters) - Danish healthcare products maker Coloplast <COLOb.CO> could be negatively affected in the key German market by private equity firm Nordic Capital's acquisition of GHD GesundHeits, brokerage Nordea wrote in a note to clients on Friday.

The Swedish private equity firm agreed on Thursday to buy GHD GesundHeits, a German healthcare-services provider and a customer of Coloplast, from IK Investment Partners. [ID:nL6N0P02W1]. Nordic Capital also owns Coloplast's U.S. competitor Convatec [CVATE.UL], leading Nordea to conclude that GHD may replace Coloplast's products. "Besides the direct impact we also see a risk of further consolidation in the home care market, which could put some pressure on Coloplast in the long term," Nordea wrote. GHD, which had sales of 485 million euros last year, was Germany's largest provider of home care to patients with serious diseases.
