June 20 (Reuters) - The $5.3 trillion-a-day global currency market, the world's biggest and least-regulated financial marketplace, has been rocked by allegations of collusion and price-rigging.

Regulators around the world, including the U.S. Department of Justice and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority have been formally investigating since October last year. Since the allegations first surfaced last year, some 40 traders have been placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world's biggest banks. No individual or bank has been accused of wrongdoing and no evidence of wrongdoing has been found. All the banks involved are cooperating with the regulators. Below are some of the main stories tracking the development of the investigation, which is likely to run into next year at least and could end up being bigger than the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal.
