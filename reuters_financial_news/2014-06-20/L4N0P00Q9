SHANGHAI, June 20 (Reuters) - China's money rates rose this week on rising money demand from cyclical month-end factors and investors trying to raise short-term funds to invest in initial public offerings (IPOs).

Money rates in China typically gain toward the end of the month, and in particular, at the end of the first half, when banks and corporates stock up on cash to burnish their balance sheets. In 2013, this cash demand saw rates hit the stratosphere as the central bank held back on liquidity, which economist saw as a swipe at high-risk shadow banking, but this time around few expect a recurrence of the cash crunch. [ID:nL3N0NY0MH]   The weighted average of the seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.45 percent in the early afternoon on Friday, up 40 basis points from last week's close.  Another actively traded tenor, the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, spiked 136 basis points this week to trade at 4.60 percent on Friday. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> rose a moderate 16 basis points to 2.78 percent, largely because that tenor does not allow clients to retain funds across the month-end."The rise of money rates, particularly the spike in the 14-day repo rate this week, has been mainly caused by cyclical demand for the 14-day repo. As expected, the end of the quarter has raised money demand, thereby pumping up the price of those benchmark instruments," said a trader from a city commercial bank in Shanghai.  The growing cash demand for investment in IPOs is also contributing to this trend, the trader said. Earlier this week, the Shanghai Stock Exchange saw intense rises in the rates of short-term pledged bond repurchase agreements as investors put up bonds as collateral to raise short-term cash, signifying enduring speculative interest in new listings even while wider indexes decline.[ID:nL4N0P00MJ] However, the rise in the pledged repo rates had no discernable impact on the wider money market. This week, the People's Bank of China injected a net 15 billion yuan ($2.42 billion) into the interbank market during open market operations, a relatively small injection compared with the past several weeks.  Traders agree that starting from May, the PBOC has started to drain money from the market gradually, but there is no need for concern about capital liquidity.
