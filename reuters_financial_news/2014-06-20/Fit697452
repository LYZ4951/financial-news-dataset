June 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned SC Poland Auto 2014-1 Limited's (SC Poland) notes an expected rating, as follows: Class A notes, due May 2025: 'AA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable Class B notes, due May 2025: 'A(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable Subordinated Loan: not rated The final rating will be contingent upon the receipt of final documents  conforming to the information already received and a satisfactory review of  final legal opinions to support the agency's analytical approach. The transaction is a securitisation of auto and unsecured consumer loans  originated in Poland by Santander Consumer Bank, S.A. (SCB, ultimately owned by  Banco Santander, S.A. <SAN.MC> (BBB+/Stable/F2)). The Polish zloty-denominated portfolio  is static and the notes will amortise from closing. About 56% of loans bear  floating interest rates. The notes will pay interest linked to one-month WIBOR  plus a margin. The interest on the class B notes will be paid subject to a cap  of 7.0%.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Decreasing Default Rates Default rates on auto loans have significantly decreased in recent years, which  in Fitch's view is a result of improved economic conditions and tightened  underwriting standards. Fitch expects a lifetime default rate of 7% for the auto  pool and 1.75% for the hire purchase pool, which has a short residual life and  has performed well historically.  Limited Recovery Prospects A large portion of auto loan recoveries stems from unsecured cash recoveries,  rather than from the sale of repossessed vehicles. The recovery prospects are  therefore significantly lower than for most European auto loan pools. Fitch  assumed base case recovery rates of 35% for both auto and unsecured loan  recoveries.  Interest Rate Risk Of the assets, 44% pay a fixed rate while the notes (78.5%) pay WIBOR. In a  rising interest rate scenario, this exposes the structure to a mismatch between  the partially fixed asset income and the floating liability costs. However, the  negative effect of rising interest rates is muted by the short life of the fixed  asset portfolio, which is less than one year.  Cap on Asset Yield Polish legislation allows a maximum interest rate of 4x the Lombard rate  (currently 4%; ie a cap of 16%). If maintained by the authorities, this cap  could negatively affect the excess spread if interest rates and correspondingly  Lombard decrease. However, given the current excess spread of 5.4%, only a  significant reduction of the interest rate cap would have a material effect. Stable Macroeconomic Outlook The mid-term forecasts for unemployment and interest rates are stable and in  line with current levels. Unemployment, which has been around 10% since 2009, is  forecast to remain flat through 2014 and 2015, as are short-term interest rates  at around 3.0% for the same period. GDP growth is expected to pick up to 2.8%  and 3.2% in 2014 and 2015 respectively, from 1.6% in 2013.  TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS From closing, SCB will continue to act as servicer of the portfolio. Banco  Santander S.A. will be appointed as servicer facilitator, in case SCB is unable  to take over the servicing activity upon servicer termination. No back-up  servicer will be initially appointed. The transaction benefits from a liquidity mechanism, initially 2.0% of the class  A and B notes, which can cover at least three months of note interest and senior  expenses if needed. After the notes have amortised to 50% of their initial  balance, the liquidity reserve will start amortising to 4% of the then current  class A and B balance, subject to a floor of 0.5%. The structure features an implicit provisioning mechanism for defaults, whereby  the amortisation amount applied to the most senior outstanding class in each  month aims at equalising the outstanding note balance with the performing asset  balance net of the initial subordinated loan balance (target principal amount). Credit enhancement will be provided to the class A and B notes by  overcollateralisation (OC) of 33.5% and 21.5% respectively as well as a  liquidity reserve of initially 1.6% (2.0% of class A and B notes), whose  amortisation amounts are part of the available distribution amount. As of 31 March 2013, the preliminary pool comprises 70% auto and 30% HP loans  with an average outstanding balance of PLN29,073 and PLN1,895, respectively.  Within the auto loan pool, 27% of loans are backed by used vehicles and 73% by  new vehicles. Individuals account for 70% of obligors, and 30% are business  entities or self-employed individuals. Floating rate loans amounted to 56% of  the portfolio and the WA remaining term was 18 months for the HP and 40 months  for the auto loan pool.
