LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - British investigators are examining millions of electronic messages which include fresh evidence of possible collusion by a small group of top currency traders, sources told Reuters.

The investigators have been handed chatroom transcripts showing senior dealers at the big banks that dominate the largely unregulated foreign exchange market routinely sharing intelligence on orders they were about to place for clients. The traders pooled order details from hedge funds and discussed the prices they should be offered, said the sources, who have seen some of the messages at the centre of an international probe into alleged collusion in world foreign exchange markets. No individual or bank has been accused of wrongdoing and no evidence of wrongdoing has been found. All the banks involved are cooperating with the regulators. Below is a timeline on the scandal engulfing the FX market.  July 2006: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealer sub-group say the group, chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett, discussed "evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that 'fixing business' generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour".  Spring 2008: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with "the relevant authorities in the UK".   May 2008: Minutes of a meeting of the BoE's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group say there was "considerable discussion" on the benchmark "fixings" again.  July 2008: A meeting of the BoE's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion "that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic as it could be subject to manipulation," BoE minutes say.  April 2012: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular chief FX dealers' meeting included a "brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings," BoE minutes say.   June 2013: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London "fixing".   July 2013: A scheduled chief dealers' meeting for 4 July never takes place.  Sept. 2013: Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing.

The Hong Kong  Monetary Authority says it is cooperating.

Jan 2014: U.S. regulators visit Citi's <C.N> main offices in London.

Feb 4, 2014: Martin Wheatley, chief executive the FCA, Britain's market regulator, says the FX allegations are "every bit as bad" as those in Libor. He also says the FCA's investigation will probably run into next year.  Feb 5, 2014: New York's banking regulator opens its investigation.
