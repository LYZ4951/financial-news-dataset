FRANKFURT, June 20 (Reuters) - Banks will return 12.618 billion euros ($17.2 billion) in long-term loans to the ECB next week, after the central bank started to charge for holding banks' excess cash overnight and promised more long-term loans.

The amount that banks will repay on June 25 is above this week's crisis loan repayments of 3.712 billion euros, and beats the 5 billion forecast in a Reuters poll. [ECB/REFI] The ECB cut interest rates this month to record lows - the deposit rate is now below zero - and launched a series of measures to pump money into the sluggish euro zone economy, pledging to do more if needed to fight off the risk of Japan-like deflation. The measures include a new 400 billion euro four-year loan scheme to give banks an incentive to increase lending to businesses in the euro zone. But it will take some time for these measures to unfold their full impact and Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret told Reuters that the negative deposit rate did not come as a surprise to banks.  "Only in a couple of weeks time will we be able to gauge whether this will indeed revive the interbank market," Dombret said in an interview that was published on Friday.  "Many banks are now pondering whether to pass on the ECB's negative interest rate to other institutions and institutional clients," he said, adding that many banks were still parking their excess funds at the central bank. Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=>, the amount of money banks have beyond what they need for their day-to-day operations, stood at 126 billion euros on Friday, above a 2-1/2 year low at around 70 billion euros hit on May 27. Banks are also waiting to see the details of the new four-year loan programme and ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure told MNI in an interview on Friday that these should come out in July or August.  On Friday, the ECB said seven banks would repay 10.300 billion euros from the first of those LTROs on June 25 and five banks would pay back 2.318 billion from the second LTRO.
