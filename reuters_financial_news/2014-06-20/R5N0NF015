SOFIA, June 20 (Reuters) - The Bulgarian government is ready to support the central bank's efforts to stabilise Corporate Commercial Bank <6C9.BB> (Corpbank), it said in a statement on Friday.

A run on the Balkan state's fourth largest-lender this week prompted the central bank to take control of Corpbank on Friday, with Central Bank Governor Ivan Iskrov urging depositors to stay calm.
