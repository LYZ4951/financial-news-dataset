PARIS, June 20 (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said neither the General Electric (GE) <GE.N> offer or the joint Siemens-Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <SIEGn.DE> <7011.T> offer for Alstom <ALSO.PA> power assets had met the government's demands, but that France would work with GE on defining a new proposal.

"The Siemens-MHI offer was serious but the government has made up its mind," Montebourg told a news conference.
