STOCKHOLM, June 20 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank is postponing the start of a sale of bonds held against assets left with it as the nation's banks collapsed during the global financial crisis.

The central bank, Sedlabanki, announced in December its holding company, the Central Bank of Iceland Holding Company (ESI), would in the first half of 2014 begin selling just over 100 billion crowns ($877 million) worth of such bonds.[ID:nL6N0JV49E] "It has been decided for the present to postpone the sale. The final arrangements will be announced at a later date," it said on Friday in a statement on its website. The delay would not affect the plan laid out in December for ESI to sell the bonds over five years, it said. Sedlabanki took over assets left with it as collateral when Iceland's largest banks - Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir - collapsed in 2008 under the weight of massive debts.  Sedlabanki later transferred the assets, along with general claims against the estates, to ESI with the goal of eventually selling them and unwinding the holding company. One of the larger asset classes consists of contractual covered bonds originally issued by Kaupthing and later taken over by Arion Bank.   "The sale is being postponed because Arion Bank, in consultation with the Financial Supervisory Authority, is examining whether it is possible to list the bonds in question directly," Sedlabanki said on Friday.  If this would prove impossible, the bonds would be sold according to the process prepared previously, it said.
