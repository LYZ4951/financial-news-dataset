LUXEMBOURG, June 20 (Reuters) - The German government can do little to prevent a real estate asset bubble from forming but point out that central bank liquidity is too high, rather than too low, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday.

Schaeuble was asked what the government would do if property prices were to rise dangerously fast due to record-low interest rates, a day after the minister warned about it happening.
