TAIPEI, June 20 (Reuters) - Investment from Japan in Taiwanese equities hit a single-month record in May, an official at Taiwan's stock market said Friday.

The overall fund inflow from Japan into Taiwan's main stock exchange reached nearly T$20 billion ($667.22 million), said David Yang, the senior executive vice president of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, more than double April's T$8 billion figure. He said Japanese investors were seeking greater opportunities overseas amid concern that Japan's market might be overvalued.
