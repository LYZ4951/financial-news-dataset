MILAN, June 20 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> opened lower on Friday on the last day of trading of rights in its mammoth capital increase.

The Italian lender is in the second week of a highly dilutive 5-billion euro rights issue with a drastic shortage of new shares disrupting trading. At 0739 GMT Monte Paschi shares were down 1.7 percent at 2.05 euros.
