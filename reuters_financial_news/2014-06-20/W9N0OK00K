WELLINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - New Zealand consumer confidence bounced back from a six-month low in June, a survey showed on Friday, with consumers a touch more optimistic about their own position and the broader economic outlook despite rising interest rates.

The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index was 131.9 from 127.6 in May. It hit a seven-year high of 135.8 in January. A reading above 100 shows optimism, while below 100 indicates pessimism. The survey showed consumers felt better off now, and were more optimistic about the near- and longer-term economic outlooks. Expectations of consumer price inflation over the next two years held steady at 3.1 percent - the lowest in nearly two years. Earlier this week official data showed the annual growth rate at the highest in more than six years, while last week the central bank raised rates for a third consecutive meeting and signaled more to come.
