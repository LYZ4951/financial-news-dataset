LISBON, June 20 (Reuters) - Portugal's CMVM market regulator on Friday suspended trading in shares of the country's largest bank, BES <BES.LS>, pending clarification from the bank over media reports that its CEO is about to step down. [ID:nL6N0P04VN]

The regulator also suspended shares in Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESF.LS>, a holding owned by the same Espirito Santo family that lost control of the bank after a recent share offering. BES shares last closed 2.7 percent lower on Thursday.
