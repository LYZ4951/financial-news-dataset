June 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> split the roles of recently departed chief operating officer, Ali Rowghani, at a time when the microblogging site is seeking to revive slowing user growth.

Adam Bain is in charge of revenue and partnerships while Gabriel Stricker is responsible for marketing and media, according to their latest Twitter profiles. The social media company's web site shows Bain's role as president of global revenue, while Stricker is vice president of marketing and communications. Technology news website Re/code earlier reported about the management changes on Thursday. (http://on.recode.net/1l9gjX0) Twitter could not be immediately reached for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. Rowghani, once seen as an influential No. 2 who oversaw Twitter's product development, finances and deal making, departed after clashing with Chief Executive Dick Costolo over whether he should continue to oversee product innovation.
