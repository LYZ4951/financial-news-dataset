LISBON, June 20 (Reuters) - The main shareholder in Portugal's largest listed bank Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> on Friday said it will propose BES chief financial officer Amilcar Morais Pires to replace CEO Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado after a shareholder assembly on July 31.

BES said in a statement that its main shareholder ESFG also proposed to create a Strategic Committee that would comprise Salgado and other key members of the Espirito Santo family. Other BES shareholders can also propose members.  The family lost control of the bank following a 1.045 billion euros ($1.42 billion) capital increase on June 11. Current directors and executives will remain in their positions at BES until the General Meeting.
