LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - A rally in drugmaker Shire helped European bourses hold onto recent gains on Friday on news the British drugs maker had been the object of a takeover bid from U.S. rival AbbVie.

Shares in Shire <SHP.L> rose 13 percent after AbbVie confirmed it had made a bid approach for the British group, which was rejected by Shire's board. It said talks were no longer ongoing. [ID:L6N0P1195]  "I'd probably take some profit there and then go back in," said Mike Reuter, a broker at Tradition. "The stock won't crash. It's an M&A candidate and I think there will be an offer, eventually."   Shire's stock added 0.9 points to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>, which was up 1.1 points, or 0.1 percent at 1,396.53 points at 0711 GMT.
