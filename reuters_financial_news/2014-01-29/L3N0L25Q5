SEOUL, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Seoul shares rose on Wednesday morning as a bold interest rate hike by Turkey soothed risk sentiment ahead of a long weekend, while investors awaited the outcome of a key policy meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Local stock markets will be closed on Thursday and Friday for the Lunar New Year holiday, and will reopen on Monday. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> was up 0.6 percent at 1,929.30 points as of 0205 GMT, extending a recovery from Monday's 1.6 percent fall. "The market is reaching back to the levels of the pre-emerging markets jitters before the holidays and Fed meeting as related concerns have somewhat alleviated overnight," said Kim Byung-yeon, an analyst at Woori Investment & Securities. Later in the global day, the Fed's two-day policy meeting comes to an end, at which it is widely expected to trim its asset-buying programme by another $10 billion a month. On Tuesday, Turkey followed India by raising interest rates at a midnight meeting of its central bank, stirring hopes that the move would short-circuit a vicious cycle of selling in emerging markets and revive risk appetite in the developed world.
