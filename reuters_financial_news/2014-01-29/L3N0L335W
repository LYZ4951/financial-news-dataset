BANGKOK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares jumped almost 2 percent while Malaysia and the Philippines also eked out gains on Wednesday as Turkey's huge increase in interest rates bolstered sentiment across Asia but Thai stocks retreated, wary of risks ahead of Sunday's poll.

Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> finished at 4,417.35 as foreign investors returned to the battered market and large caps such as Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> and Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> recouped some of their recent losses. The Indonesian bourse recorded net foreign buying of 245 billion rupiah ($20.10 million) on Wednesday, its first in four sessions. Malaysia's main index <.KLSE> was up 0.45 percent, the Philippines' main index <.PSI> gained 0.8 percent while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 1 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] Thai shares <.SETI> pared earlier gains, ending a tad lower at 1,271.42 amid active selling in shares of Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> and Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK>. Players remained on the sidelines, with the market's trading volume falling to 0.7 times of its full day average over the past 30 sessions, as the Thai government pushed ahead with a general election on Sunday despite warnings it could end in violence. [ID:nL3N0L22FC] Foreign investors sold shares worth a net 599 million baht ($18.21 million), adding to their net redemption of $205 million over the past three sessions. <TH/TRADING02><.VMSFN.BK> Singapore <.FTSTI> underperformed peers, down 0.5 percent as investors trimmed positions ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays. Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines will be closed on Friday for a Lunar New Year holiday, while Malaysia will remain shut on Thursday and Friday.
