OSLO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Norway's Finance Supervisory Authority will not propose changes to mortgage lending guidelines but if household debt does not decrease, new measures to limit credit growth may be necessary, the watchdog said in a statement on Wednesday.

Banks can lend up to 85 percent of the value of homes, down from an earlier 90 percent, and the government has said this level may be too low, restricting the mortgage market.
