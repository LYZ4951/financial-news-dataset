The 10-year subordinated notes qualify as Basel III compliant, Tier 2 capital under the Malaysian central bank's capital adequacy framework and is part of an existing 7 billion ringgit debt programme, Maybank said. The debt carries a coupon rate of 4.9 percent per annum, the lender said. It did not disclose who took up the debt.
