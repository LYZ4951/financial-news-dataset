CAIRO, Jan 29(Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> strengthened fractionally at a central bank currency sale but weakened on the black market on Wednesday.

The central bank sold $38.6 million to banks with a cut-off price of 6.9517 pounds to the dollar on Wednesday, compared with a cut off price of 6.9518 at an exceptional auction on Monday. The bank had offered to sell up to $40 million. On the black market, a trader said the dollar was offered at 7.35 pounds on Wednesday compared with 7.25 on Monday. The central bank introduced dollar currency sales a year ago to help counter a run on the pound. It has burned through at least $20 billion - or roughly half its reserves - supporting the currency since Egypt's 2011 uprising, which hit tourism revenues and foreign investment.
