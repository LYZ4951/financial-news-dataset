LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday after Turkey hiked all its key interest rates overnight to defend its currency, helping to buoy equity markets that had been hit by waning appetite for riskier assets.

Turkey's central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 12 percent from 7.75 percent in a much sharper move than forecast, and investors said it could help stem a recent sell-off in emerging markets.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.8 percent at 1,308.29 points in early trading, and the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> rose 1 percent to 3,068.96 points.
