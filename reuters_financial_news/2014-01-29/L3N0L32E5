MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS>, India's biggest private sector lender, posted its slowest quarterly growth in four years as asset quality worsened and funds set aside for bad loans and contingencies almost doubled from a year earlier.

Net profit reached 25.3 billion rupees ($404.12 million) in October-December from 22.5 billion a year earlier, the bank said on Wednesday. That was higher than the 24.6 billion rupee mean estimate of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and paid, rose about 22 percent to 42.6 billion rupees. Net non-performing loans as a percentage of total assets rose to 0.94 percent from 0.76 percent. Net interest margin improved to 3.32 percent from 3.07 percent. Shares of ICICI, with a market value of $18.6 billion, briefly fell after the results but pared losses to trade up 0.9 percent at 1,027.8 rupees at 0714 GMT. The broader market <.BSESN> was up 0.43 percent.
