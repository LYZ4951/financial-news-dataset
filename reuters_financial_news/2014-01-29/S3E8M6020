STOCKHOLM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Total lending to Swedish households rose 4.9 percent in December from the same month a year ago, the same pace as in November, the statistics office said on Wednesday.

Swedish policymakers have expressed concern about household borrowing levels that, at around 170 percent of disposable income, are among the highest in Europe.
