LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Shareholders in Dutch information provider Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing (BvD) are set to take a 210 million-euro ($287 million) dividend by amending existing debt and raising a new subordinated loan, banking sources said.

Based in Amsterdam, BvD is a publisher of electronic business and company information, with more than 30 offices worldwide and over 600 employees.  Charterhouse acquired the company in July 2011 backed with 505 million euros of leveraged loans including a 40 million euro term loan A; a 300 million euro term loan B; and a 140 million euro mezzanine loan. The junior mezzanine tranche was refinanced in 2014 with a senior term loan C, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  Shareholders are now seeking to take a 210 million euro divided payment in three ways - via cash on the balance sheet; amending and increasing existing senior term loans; and raising a new 145 million euro second lien loan from institutional investors.  The deal is likely to attract interest from a number of cash-rich investors eager to put money to work following a lack of new money deals in 2013, the five sources said.   "BvD has performed well. It has a sticky customer base, it is cash generative and its earnings have moved upwards," one of the sources said. Charterhouse declined to comment and BvD was not immediately available to comment.  Lenders to BvD have been asked to agree to an amendment to allow the company to converge existing TLA, TLB and TLC loans into a new 525 million euro term loan D, denominated in euros, sterling and dollars, the sources said.  The TLD is offered with interest margins of 450 basis points (bps) on the dollar and euro tranches and 475 bps on the sterling portion, in both cases 25 bps lower than what BvD is currently paying. The new 145 million euro second lien facility will be denominated in euros and dollars and is guided to pay around 750 bps with a 1 percent floor, the sources said.  BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> are global co-ordinators, mandated lead arrangers (MLAs) and bookrunners on the transaction, and GE Capital <GE.N>, HSBC <HSBA.L> and ING <ING.AS> are MLAs, the sources said.   A bank meeting took place to showcase the deal to investors on Tuesday and commitments are due on Feb. 7.
