SINGAPORE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Commodity firms outperformed the Singapore market as the index edged down ahead of the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting through Wednesday.

Top performers on the index included Wilmar International Ltd <WLIL.SI> and Golden Agri-Resources Ltd <GAGR.SI>. Wilmar rebounded from a one-week decline, climbing as much as 1.6 percent to S$3.16, its biggest daily gain in nearly 10 weeks, while Golden Agri gained 2 percent to an intra-day high at S$0.52. Better margins for overseas buyers and refiners from a weaker ringgit helped lift demand for palm oil even as fragile emerging markets and declining vegetable oil prices weighed on the palm market. [ID:nL3N0L22Z0] The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> had slipped 0.7 percent to 3,040.2 as of 0510 GMT, while the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> gained 1.3 percent. Among other stocks, shares of CDL Hospitality Trusts <CDLT.SI> rose 1.3 percent to S$1.61, their biggest daily gain in almost three weeks. The subsidiary of City Development Ltd <CTDM.SI> on Tuesday said its 2013 fourth-quarter revenue and Distribution per Unit (DPU) rose 2.8 and 0.7 percent year-on-year respectively. [ID:nSNZ4zKshk]
