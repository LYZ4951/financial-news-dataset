MADRID, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest bank, BBVA <BBVA.MC>, is expected to report a 22.5 percent rise in 2013 net profit thanks to favourable comparison with last year when it made hefty provisions against rotten real estate assets.

However, on a quarterly basis the bank is expected to register a loss of 1.05 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the fourth quarter due to the sale of a 5 percent stake in Chinese lender Citic Bank Corporation (CNCB).
