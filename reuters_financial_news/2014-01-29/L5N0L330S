LAGOS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> was flat on the interbank market on Wednesday, ending a two day slide as the central bank offered U.S. dollars at a forward auction to support the local currency.

The naira closed at 162.92 to the dollar, compared with 162.95 to the dollar the previous day. The central bank on Wednesday sold an unknown amount of dollars at a forward auction of one to three months. The local currency has weakened by 0.42 naira since Monday as foreign investors sold off bonds and recouped dollars, in a broad sell-off seen across emerging markets this week.
