BOSTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman on Tuesday told clients that he still think Herbalife is running a pyramid scheme and that one of the analysts who has been working with him on the short bet against the company has resigned.

Shane Dinneen is leaving Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management," because "he decided it was time for him to move on to areas of his own interest outside of activist investing," Ackman wrote in the letter, dated Jan. 28. A copy was seen by Reuters.
