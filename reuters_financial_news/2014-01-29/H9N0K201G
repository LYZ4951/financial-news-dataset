Jan 29 (Reuters) - China shares extended a rebound on Wednesday, with the financial sector buoying a second-straight day of index gains ahead of a week-long Lunar New Year holiday starting on Friday.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, which suffered its biggest loss in three weeks on Monday, finished up 0.6 percent at 2,049.9 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings crept up 0.4 percent. [ID:nL3N0L30Y7]
