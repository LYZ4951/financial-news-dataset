LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Sales of catastrophe bonds, used by insurers as a way of selling on their exposure to natural disasters, are close to levels last seen before the financial crisis, new data shows.

A flood of capital from pension and hedge funds, drawn by 5-7 percent yields for many so-called "cat bonds" when more traditional assets pay rock bottom rates, has driven down prices and hurt profitability for reinsurers.  Figures from insurance broker Willis <WSH.N> published on Wednesday show total issuance during 2013 reached $7.1 billion, close to the $7.2 billion record reached during 2007.
