SAO PAULO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's largest listed private-sector banks are set for another quarter of robust earnings after rising interest rates boosted interest income and efforts to shun risky lending and cut expenses bore fruit.

Analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll expect fourth-quarter data from Brazil's top-three non-government banks to also reflect the impact of a stricter credit risk assessment and a seasonal uptick in demand for credit during year-end.  Return on equity, a gauge of profitability that measures how well banks invest shareholder money, rose in the wake of lower expenses and higher fee income, the poll found. In the prior two years, ROE, as the gauge is known, fell dramatically after the government pressed lenders to cut borrowing costs. "The moment for the industry is positive as the selective and conservative approach to credit is leading to declines in bad loan provisions and higher return on equity readings," said Francisco Kops, an analyst with J. Safra Corretora. Defaults fell again more as a result of the banks' risk-off credit approach than to an improving economy. Net interest margin, the average rate earned on loans, continued to edge higher in some credit segments, the poll said.  While banking results should rise on a sequential basis, structural trends in the sector may continue to hamper revenue, said Carlos Macedo, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group. Shares of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA>, Banco Bradesco SA <BBDC4.SA> and Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB4.SA> shed a combined 5.6 percent this year, wiping out gains stemming from two consecutive quarters of better-than-expected earnings. Itaú and Bradesco will unveil guidance for this year, which "should be cautious given the limited visibility resulting from the October presidential election and the World Cup" in June, Macedo said. Investors will also focus on management comments about competition with state-run banks, tax relief plans and the impact of Brazil's anemic economic expansion on bank earnings. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  TABLE on fourth-quarter bank results: [ID:nL2N0L00IP]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Bradesco and Santander Brasil release earnings on Thursday before markets open. Itaú plans to publish fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 4. Bradesco's recurring profit rose 3.3 percent to 3.18 billion reais ($1.32 billion) on a quarterly basis as fee income and disbursements jumped, according to the average estimates of eight analysts. Recurring profit excludes one-off items. Defaults fell at Bradesco, while its loan book growth outpaced that of provision expenses. Management may use one-off gains stemming from a tax relief program to replenish shareholders' equity - which fell in prior quarters as the value of Bradesco's government debt holdings tumbled, said Regina Longo Sanchez, an analyst with Itaú BBA.  Santander Brasil's recurring profit probably slipped 5.6 percent to 1.33 billion reais on a sequential basis, according to the estimates of eight analysts. The bank also had one-off gains from the tax relief plan, known as Refis, and the sale of its asset-management unit, the poll showed. Santander's loan book rose 2 percent led by payroll and mortgage loan disbursements, according to poll results. Despite a decline in defaults, bad loan provisions probably rose. "Operating trends at Santander Brasil are improving, but very slowly," said Eduardo Rosman, an analyst with Grupo BTG Pactual. Itaú's recurring profit probably rose 3 percent to 4.14 billion reais in the quarter, with ROE rising to 21 percent, the estimates of seven analysts showed. Spreads rose for most products while expenses grew below inflation, analysts said.  Itaú's bad loans provisions slumped 12.3 percent, in line with a decline in the default ratio to a record-low 3.8 percent of outstanding loans, the poll showed. "We expect Itaú to post the best set of quarterly results, from a qualitative and quantitative point of view, which should pave the way for a stronger 2014," Goldman's Macedo noted.
