ABU DHABI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's First Gulf Bank <FGB.AD> on Wednesday said its fourth-quarter net profit rose 19 percent aided by strong investment returns and gains arising from a real estate recovery.

The lender, majority-owned by Abu Dhabi's ruling family, made a net profit of 1.37 billion dirhams ($373 million) for the three months ended December 31, compared with 1.15 billion dirhams in the prior-year period, it said in a statement.
