MADRID, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Popular <POP.MC> is expected to post a 261 million euro ($357 million) profit for 2013, according to the averaged estimates of 10 analysts polled by Reuters, recovering from a loss the previous year when it made steep provisions against soured real estate loans and foreclosed property.

Spain's fifth-biggest bank by market value, which reports full-year earnings on Friday, took the bulk of those provisions in the last three months of 2012. Popular, which bulked up its capital last year by bringing in new Mexican investors, is also expected to benefit from gains on asset disposals in 2013. Analysts expect Popular to post a 50.1 million euro profit for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to a year ago loss. Its fourth quarter net interest income (NII) - the difference between earnings on loans and funding costs - is forecast to stay broadly flat compared to the previous three months, while dropping under 2 percent from the year before. Other Spanish banks have reported improvements in fourth quarter in NII at the end of 2013, helped by falling deposit costs. But lenders have also been cutting their holdings of sovereign debt, which had helped prop up interest income in the past.
