JOHANNESBURG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - South Africa's central bank raised interest rates on Wednesday, keeping in step with attempts by Turkey and other emerging market economies to shore up their currencies, but risking the ire of the ruling ANC shortly before an election.

"Exchange rate pressures are expected to intensify as markets adjust to the new pattern of global capital flows," South African Reserve Bank (SARB) governor Gill Marcus told a news conference.  ANALYSTS COMMENTS TRADITION ANALYTICS "This is the first time since June 2008 that the SARB tightened policy and highlights the depth of concern over the emerging market rout witnessed in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to taper quantitative easing, and the subsequent inflation risks posed by the severe depreciation in the rand. "Growth dynamics remain weak, however, and the decision to hike rates has no doubt been a begrudging response to global factors beyond the control of the SARB as monetary authorities would have been under political pressure to keep policy accommodative. "The decision is possibly the best outcome as it is bound to provide room for a much needed recovery in the rand. More Fed tapering is likely imminent and this should keep EMs, who benefitted greatly from a prolonged period of loose policy which sent a wall of money flooding into its higher yielding assets, in a vulnerable position. "More rate hikes cannot be ruled out, yet the cycle is expected to be sharp and short lived as economic growth fundamentals remain particularly weak."  MARKET REACTION
