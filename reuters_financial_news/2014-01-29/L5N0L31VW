JOHANNESBURG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Standard Bank <SBKJ.J> said on Wednesday it would sell a 60 percent stake in its London-based markets unit to China's ICBC for $765 million, as Africa's top lender continues to scale back operations outside the continent.

The deal also reflects a growing appetite by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) <601398.SS> to trade commodities as well as consume them. Reuters reported in July that Standard Bank was in talks to sell the business to ICBC, its top shareholder. [ID:nL6N0G13YN] Standard Bank, which is 20 percent owned by ICBC, has been hiving off its operations outside Africa to focus on fast growing sub-Saharan markets. ICBC will acquire 60 percent of the London-based markets business, which focuses on commodities, fixed income, currencies, credit and equities products. ICBC will also be granted a five-year option to purchase another 20 percent of the business for cash. Standard Bank said it will retain its London-based investment banking and transaction products businesses.
