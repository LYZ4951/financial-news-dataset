FRANKFURT, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Private-sector deposits declined slightly in Cypriot banks in December, offsetting the November rise in a sign of stabilisation after 17 months of falls.

Big account holders in the two largest lenders on the eastern Mediterranean island were forced to take a hit as part of an international bailout last year. Private-sector deposits fell 0.8 percent to 35.1 billion euros ($47.9 billion) in December from the previous month, and were at the same level as in October, European Central Bank (ECB) data showed on Wednesday. The deposits are still 30 percent below their peak of 50.5 billion euros in May 2012. Banks in the euro zone member state were shut for nearly two weeks last March after Cyprus agreed a 10-billion-euro bailout under which major depositors had to pay part of the cost of the rescue. Capital controls are still in place, with limits on how much people can transfer from their accounts, although Cyprus is gradually easing the restrictions. The ECB data showed deposits in other southern European countries mired in the debt crisis remained relatively stable. Private-sector deposits rose by just over 1 percent in Greece and slightly less than that in Portugal. The increase in Spain amounted to 0.1 percent. In Italy, private-sector deposits declined by 0.9 percent and by 1.1 percent in Ireland. Monthly fluctuations in the figures are common, though sharp consecutive drops in countries with stable banking systems are unusual.
