MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has shifted its target exchange-rate corridor for the rouble by five kopecks, following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline.         The new corridor extends from 33.70-40.70 roubles to the dollar-euro currency basket <RUS=MCX> as of Jan. 28, compared to 33.65-40.65 previously.          Under its managed float, the central bank increases its interventions as the rouble approaches the boundary of the corridor. Once an intervention allotment of $350 million is exhausted it automatically shifts the corridor.         The rouble was trading at 40.15 against the basket at 0605 GMT.
