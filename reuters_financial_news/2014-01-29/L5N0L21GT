COPENHAGEN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Regional financial institution Ringkjobing Landbobank <RILBA.CO> posted a rise in pretax profit for 2013 compared with 2012 due to an increase in customer numbers [ID:nWEB00HAS].

Following are quotes from Chief Executive John Fisker:  About results: "The results are mainly created because of a huge increase in the customer base. After a couple of years with a shrinking loan book the trend was broken in 2013 with an 11 percent increase in banks loans." "The increase in loans is not due to existing customers. It is 100 percent due to an exceptional good year when it comes to news customers, and wind turbine financing." "I expect we will see an increase in loans again in 2014, and it will be driven by new customers again. Existing customers was paying of their loans in 2013 and we expect they will continue to do so in 2014."  About dividend: "We spend 56 percent of profit after tax on dividend and a share buy-back program. The remaining 44 percent will be added to shareholders' equity, which can be used to support expected growth in coming years."
