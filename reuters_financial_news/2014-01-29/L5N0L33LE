WARSAW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank is not worried about the zloty currency, because the fundamentals of the economy are strong and the currency weakened due to external factors, a member of the bank's board said.

Eugeniusz Gatnar also told state news agency PAP that a rise in the currency's volatility would be a negative development, but there was no reason for concern for now. The zloty <EURPLN=D2> has fallen 1.3 percent to 4.2150 to the euro since last Thursday, hit by turmoil in other emerging markets that led the Turkish central bank to an emergency rate hike to defend the tumbling lira currency. "Markets are nervous, investors act under the influence of emotions and there is herding among investors," Gatnar said. "Our fundamentals are strong though, so there are no reasons for zloty weakening."  Poland's central bank intervened to support the zloty in June last year when it traded at around 4.3 zlotys to the euro. Poland's central bank has repeatedly said that it is ready to intervene to curb excessive volatility.
