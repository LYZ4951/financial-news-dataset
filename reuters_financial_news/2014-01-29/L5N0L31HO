DUBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Conglomerate Dubai Investments <DINV.DU> reported a more than two-fold jump in its 2013 net profit on Wednesday, on the back of higher gain on fair value of its investments, profit from sale of properties and reduced finance costs.

The company, in which sovereign fund Investment Corp of Dubai owns an 11.5 percent stake, posted a net profit of 822 million dirhams ($223.8 million), compared with 321.4 million dirhams in 2012. Revenue for the period was 2.8 billion dirhams compared to 2.3 billion dirhams in 2012.
