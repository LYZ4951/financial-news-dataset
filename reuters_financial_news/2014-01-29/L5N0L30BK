DUBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Bank Muscat <BMAO.OM> said on Wednesday that its board proposed a cash dividend of 25 percent and an additional 15 percent payout through the issue of mandatory convertible bonds.

The three-year convertible bonds will pay a coupon of 4.5 percent annually and have a conversion price of 20 percent below the three-month average share price at the time of conversion, the Omani lender said in a bourse statement.
