BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Italian Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni on Wednesday denied reports that negotiations with Switzerland aimed at allowing Italy to uncover evaded taxes had broken down.

"They haven't broken down. Tomorrow I am going to Bern and the negotiations are ongoing over all the fiscal questions open with Switzerland," Saccomanni told reporters in Brussels. A Swiss finance ministry spokeswoman also denied the reports.
