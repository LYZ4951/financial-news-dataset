NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based mutual funds poured $6.4 billion into stock funds in the week ended Jan. 22 on optimism that equities would push higher this year, data from the Investment Company Institute showed on Wednesday.

The inflows into stock funds marked a second straight week of new demand after a modest outflow of $411 million in the first week of the year, according to data from ICI, a U.S. mutual fund trade organization.  The appetite for stock funds was down a little from the prior week, when the funds attracted $8.3 billion in new cash, the largest inflows since early November. The latest inflows came even as the Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX> stock index fell a modest 0.2 percent over the holiday-shortened week. The inflows buttressed some analysts' view that U.S. stocks may rally further this year after record highs in 2013. Funds that mainly hold non-U.S. stocks attracted about $4 billion in new cash, down slightly from the prior week, while funds that specialize in U.S. stocks attracted $2.45 billion in new money. Investors pulled a meager $247 million from bond funds, meanwhile, reversing inflows over the previous two weeks. The outflows came even as prices of safe-haven U.S. Treasuries gained slightly over the weekly period.  Hybrid funds, which can invest in stocks and fixed income securities, attracted $1.6 billion in new cash, marking the biggest inflows into the funds in 12 weeks.
