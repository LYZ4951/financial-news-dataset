Jan 29 (Reuters) - Sotheby's <BID.N> will pay investors a special dividend and buy back shares, months after activist investor Daniel Loeb called for a management shakeup at the auction house.

Sotheby's shares rose 7 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday. The company said it would pay shareholders a $300 million special dividend in March and buy back stock worth $150 million under a new share repurchase program.
