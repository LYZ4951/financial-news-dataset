OSLO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Norwegian unit of top Nordic bank Nordea <NDA.ST> expects the country's slower economic growth to lead to less demand for credit from households and businesses, while the global shipping industry will become better at serving its debts it said on Wednesday.

"A strong result in 2013 is a good start for the year. Going forward we expect limited credit demand. In addition to businesses being more careful, we see that households are more sceptical towards the housing market," Nordea Norway chief Gunn Waersted told Reuters. The bank remains willing to lend to both new and existing customers, while some financial institutions have restricted lending in order to build capital, she said. Waersted added there had been a significant change in demand for pensions savings in Norway. "In 2013 we saw a quadrupling of new subscriptions, but we still see a big potential in the Norwegian market," she said. The shipping industry, which has gone through years of poor profitability in the wake of the global financial crisis, will cause fewer losses in 2014 than in 2013, she added. "We see lower losses in shipping in line with a gradual improvement and a normalisation of the shipping market," Waersted said. In the fourth quarter Nordea Norway's net interest income was 2.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($407.70 million), with an operating profit of 1.9 billion.
