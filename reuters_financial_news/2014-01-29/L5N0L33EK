LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - One in three senior bank executives believes their institution has poor anti-money laundering controls at a time when the threat of vast regulatory fines and criminal prosecutions is increasing, according to a KPMG survey.

The annual survey, which quizzed 317 anti-money laundering and compliance professionals in banks and financial institutions across 48 countries, said only around one half thought their systems were able to provide a complete picture by monitoring transactions across businesses and jurisdictions. Regulators worldwide have been cracking down on lax money laundering controls and last year, Europe's largest bank HSBC <HSBA.L> paid $1.92 billion to settle U.S. charges it allowed Mexican and Colombian cartels to launder drugs proceeds. The UK division of South Africa's largest bank, Standard Bank Group <SBKJ.J>, became the first commercial bank to be penalised in Britain for such an offence last week when it was fined 7.6 million pounds ($12.6 million).

KPMG said its report showed that institutions are nevertheless continuing to outsource and off-shore these parts of their business, despite senior managements' concerns about a lack of control and oversight.
