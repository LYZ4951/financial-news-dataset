VIENNA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The selected buyer for Bulgaria's largest private pension fund, Doverie withdrew from the deal last month, the seller Vienna Insurance Group <VIGR.VI> said on Wednesday.

The Austrian group's chief executive Peter Hagen told reporters Vienna planned to keep Doverie for now. The buyer, UK-registered company United Capital, had said in July it planned to file soon for regulatory approvals with Bulgarian authorities.
