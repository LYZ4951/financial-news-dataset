WELLINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The number of new dwelling consents approved in New Zealand rose a seasonally adjusted 7.6 percent in December, driven by a rise in building projects in the Canterbury region, according to official data issued on Thursday.

For the year, new consents hit a six-year high, due mainly to a growing number of projects in Auckland, the country's largest city, and in Canterbury, where earthquake rebuilding projects are underway. The monthly figure followed an upwardly revised 12.5 percent rise in November, and was the fifth straight month of increases, Statistics New Zealand said. The number of building consent approvals was 39 percent higher than the same month a year ago. Excluding consents for apartments, which can cause volatility in the data, the number of seasonally adjusted consents rose 10.7 percent on the previous month. Earthquake-related consents in the Canterbury region, which includes the country's second largest city of Christchurch and is undergoing extensive rebuilding projects, totalled NZ$59 million ($48.75 million) compared with NZ$40 million the previous month. Building consents issued for Auckland and the Canterbury region last month accounted for 63 percent of the national total.
