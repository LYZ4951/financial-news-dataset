STERLING - "In terms of sterling, in general we avoid commenting on the level of the currency or providing commentary on the currency." - "We would expect some pass-through of sterling strength to help reinforce other forces that were helping to create a more benign inflation environment - more benign not totally benign - and they include global disinflationary pressures."  - "Price movements in the euro zone, in the U.S. are quite weak and commodity prices as a whole... have been weaker than the recent past." - "So it's within a context of providing some dampening to the inflation outlook."  - "That leads us to expect that the pace of consumption - growth, the pace of household spending as a whole including housing investment - will gradually slow over the course of the coming quarters which makes it that much more important that we see investment pick-up and ultimately exports picking up."   FORWARD GUIDANCE - "It's incredibly important what happens in the U.S.. There are some real similarities in the stance of monetary policy - in the strategy of monetary - between the UK and the U.S.." - "We are not continuing with asset purchases, so that's different as a tactic, but the general question is how much slack is in our economies, and to what extent can highly accommodative policy encourage sustainable demand to pick up some of that slack." - "We provided for the first phase of forward guidance, we used the 7.0 percent unemployment threshold to give businesses in Scotland and across the UK a confidence that we weren't going to premature withdraw monetary stimulus." - "The MPC has signalled that we don't see any need for an immediate adjustment to that policy, and we will provide further thinking on guidance in the coming weeks."  - "But I will say, one last point .., that while the market has had a different view on when the unemployment threshold was going to be achieved, and the market view has been closer to the base case forecasts of the bank, the market has clearly taken in that 7 pct is a threshold and not a trigger."  - "And in fact market expectations of when we would raise interest rates are still in 2015, and the first quarter of 2015, which is consistent with that."
