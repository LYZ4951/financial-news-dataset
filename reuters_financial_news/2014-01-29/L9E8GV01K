LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Britain has raised 4.75 billion pounds ($7.88 billion) at a re-opening of its ultra-long index-linked 2068 gilt, a bookrunner said on Wednesday.

Investors put in orders in excess of 12 billion pounds for the 0.125 percent 2068 index-linked-gilt <GBIL0E68=>, which sold at a price equivalent to a yield 0.25 basis points above that of the index-linked gilt maturing in 2062 <GBIL0R62=>.
