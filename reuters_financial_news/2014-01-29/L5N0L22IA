LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Europe proposed a draft law on Wednesday to ban proprietary trading at banks and isolate other types of trading from deposit-taking, the 'safe' side of banking. It also proposed new transparency rules for stock lending.

The aim of the law is to make it less likely that a trade gone wrong threatens depositors or requires a taxpayer bailout, and marks the European Union's first attempt to change banks' structures after forcing them to hold more capital. The United States will introduce a similar change from 2015, known as the Volcker Rule. France, Germany and Britain are already introducing national reforms to curb trading risks. The main points of the draft law are: * Proprietary trading: The EU proposes a ban on the bloc's 30 or so biggest banks from taking bets on stocks, bonds and commodities, though such activity has shrunk since the 2007-09 banking crisis. Britain, France and Germany say proprietary trading should be isolated but not banned. Volcker bans proprietary trading and covers all lenders, not just the biggest. * Trading on behalf of clients: The EU proposal says such non-speculative trading like market making, securitisation and complex derivatives may have to be walled off. Germany and France have warned that separation could hamper a bank's ability to fund the economy, and limit the benefits of their one-stop-shop "universal" banking model.  * Securities financing transactions: The EU proposed separate draft rules to increase transparency in lending and borrowing of shares, transactions used by hedge funds for short-selling or bets on falling share prices. * What next? Germany and France say the EU law must be in "harmony" with their own reforms, and Britain will want an opt- out due to it own changes known as the Vickers reform, meaning that a big chunk of EU banking may be exempt.
