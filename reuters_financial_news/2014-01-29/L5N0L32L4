JOHANNESBURG, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The following are comments from South African Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus at her latest decision on interest rates:

INFLATION "The headline inflation forecast of the bank has deteriorated since the previous MPC meeting mainly as a result of revisions to the assumptions regarding the rand exchange rate.  "The forecast average inflation rate for 2014 is 0.6 percent points higher at 6.3 percent... "Inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2014 and to reach a peak of 6.6 percent in the final quarter of the year before declining to 6 percent in second quarter of 2015...  "The deterioration as a measure of underlying inflation continues to be driven primarily by the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate."RAND "The recent depreciation of the rand, if sustained, will raise significantly the risk to the inflation outlook. Our inflation forecast shows a marked deterioration despite the absence of clear evidence of domestic demand pressures."  ECONOMIC CHALLENGES "The MPC carefully considered the economic challenges facing South Africa and the appropriate policy response. On the one hand, inflation forecasts indicate the possibility of being out of the target range for an extended period, largely due to the impact of the depreciating currency.  "The risks to the inflation forecast are seen to be significantly on the upside. Large adjustments to the exchange rate will inevitably impact on inflation, even in conditions of relatively low pass-through such as we have been experiencing."  GROWTH "Annual growth in 2013 is estimated to have been around 1.9 percent. Although an improved outcome for 2014, growth is still expected to remain below estimated potential output of between 3.0 and 3.5 percent.  "The Bank's forecasts for growth is 2014 and 2015 have been revised to 2.8 percent and 3.3 percent respectively, down from 3.0 percent and 3.4 percent in the previous forecast round."  RATE DECISION "The MPC has decided to increase the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent per annum as of 30 January 2014. The MPC is of the view that, notwithstanding this increase in the repo rate, the monetary policy remains accommodative.
