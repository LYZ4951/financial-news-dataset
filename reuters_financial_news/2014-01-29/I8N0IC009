MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - State Bank of India <SBI.NS>, the country's biggest lender, on Wednesday raised $1.2 billion through a share sale, less than its target of $1.5 billion, three sources with direct knowledge of the deal said.

The state-run bank, which accounts for a quarter of the country's loans and deposits, sold 49.64 million shares to institutional investors at 1,565 rupees each, said the sources, declining to be named before an official announcement.
