LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Barclays <BARC.L> said it has no plans to announce any branch closures in Britain next month, after reports it planned to shut a quarter of its network.

The bank said results released on Feb. 11 will include additional costs of 220 million pounds ($365 million) and charges against income of 110 million pounds in its investment bank, related to litigation and regulatory penalties. The bank said in a brief statement on Wednesday the results will include plans to improve its leverage position. "There is no intention to make an announcement about branch closures in the UK," it said. [ID:nL5N0L30Y7]
