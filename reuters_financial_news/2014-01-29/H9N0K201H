Jan 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares produced their first gain in five days, helping benchmark indexes bounce off five-month lows on Wednesday after a big hike in Turkish interest rates halted a selloff in emerging markets.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI>, which closed on Tuesday at its lowest since end-August, finished up 0.8 percent at 22,141.6 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 1.4 percent.
