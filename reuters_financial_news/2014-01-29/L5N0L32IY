JOHANNESBURG, Jan 28 (Reuters) -

INFLATION "The headline inflation forecast of the bank has deteriorated since the previous MPC meeting mainly as a result of revisions to the assumptions regarding the rand exchange rate.  "The forecast average inflation rate for 2014 is 0.6 percent points higher at 6.3 percent... "Inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the second quarter of 2014 and to reach a peak of 6.6 percent in the final quarter of the year before declining to 6 percent in second quarter of 2015...  "The deterioration as a measure of underlying inflation continues to be driven primarily by the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate."
