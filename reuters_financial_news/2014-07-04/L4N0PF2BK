BANGKOK, July 4 (Reuters) - Thailand's key stock market index posted a seventh straight gain to a near one-year high on Friday as the prospects of loan demand growth lifted banking stocks, while foreign buying of selected large caps in Indonesia took the benchmark there to a more than three-week high.

Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> rose 0.2 percent, finishing the week 0.9 percent higher. Shares of Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> climbed 2 percent to a 1-month high amid positive broker ratings. Nineteen of 27 analysts rate the stock a 'buy' or 'strong buy', seven put 'hold' and one has a 'sell' rating, Thomson Reuters data showed. "Management signalled that SCB is ready to shift its game plan from defence to offence ... SCB remains one of our sector favourites, with its likely-solid second quarter earnings as a potential near-term re-rating catalyst," broker CIMB said in a report. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> ended up 0.4 percent, with a weekly gain of 1.3 percent, its first in four weeks. Stock exchange data showed net foreign buying in shares of Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> and Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK>. Indonesia's presidential election is due on Wednesday. Other stock markets in Southeast Asia also notched up gains on the week. Vietnam <.VNI> and the Philippines were each up about 1.8 percent, while Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> ended slightly higher.
