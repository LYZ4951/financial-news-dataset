VIENNA, July 4 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> expects to make a profit in Romania this year, the lender said after Austrian rival Erste Group <ERST.VI> warned of a record loss this year due to hits from Romania and Hungary. [ID:nL6N0PF1E9]

"RBI has founded, and not purchased, its Romanian subsidiary in 1998. Therefore, there is no risk of goodwill impairment," Chief Executive Karl Sevelda said in a statement, adding local management had taken a "very prudent" approach to risk management. "In 2013, Raiffeisen Bank in Romania has earned a profit after tax of 100 million euros, and we expect a profit there again this year," he said without giving further details.  RBI said it had total goodwill of 544 million euros ($742 million) on its books at the end of 2013, mostly for Russia and Poland and none for Romania or Hungary.
