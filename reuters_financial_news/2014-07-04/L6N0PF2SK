STOCKHOLM, July 4 (Reuters) - Sven-Erik Osterberg, vice chairman of the general council of the Swedish central bank, has been appointed by the government as a new member of the board of the Swedish FSA, the Riksbank said in a statement.

After the turn of the year, Osterberg will take over as chairman of the board and will therefore leave the General Council after September general elections.
