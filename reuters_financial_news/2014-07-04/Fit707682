July 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on Talisman 7 plc's class A notes to Stable from Negative and affirmed all ratings as follows:  EUR94.4m class A: affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook revised to Stable from Negative  EUR87.3m class B: affirmed at 'BBsf'; Outlook Negative EUR84.2m class C: affirmed at 'Bsf'; Outlook Negative EUR66.5m class D: affirmed at 'CCCsf'; Recovery estimate (RE) 30% EUR47.1m class E: affirmed at 'CCsf'; RE0% EUR68.9m class F: affirmed at 'Csf'; RE0% EUR44.8m class G: not rated EUR10.7m class H: not rated EUR19.4m class I: not rated EUR3.9m class J: not rated Talisman 7 plc is a securitisation of originally 10 commercial mortgage loans  originated by ABN AMRO Bank NV. As at end-April 2014,  all the remaining nine  loans were in special servicing and had  an outstanding cumulative balance of  EUR527.2m. The loans are backed by 82 properties located in Germany valued at  EUR384.2m.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The revision of the class A's Outlook reflects the strong sequential pay-down of  the transaction over the last four interest payment days (IPD). As a result the  class A note has amortised to EUR94.4m from 333.8m a year ago through asset  sales. At the same time the stable performance and the successful sales efforts  underpin  today's affirmation of the ratings.  The Mozart loan asset sale (the largest loan in the portfolio and a syndicated  senior EUR279.6m loan of a EUR484.3m whole loan) has progressed with 27 assets  sold over the last year, leaving 34 mixed-use properties located around Germany  in the portfolio. Fitch notes that sale agreements have been signed for a  further five assets. The pace of asset sales, together with sale prices being  achieved on average above valuations, partially mitigates increasing leverage.  The loan-to-value of the portfolio increased to 121% from 91% over the last 12  months, reflecting a more negative view on the remaining portfolio.  The Eschborn office asset securing the Brahms loan was sold for EUR23.4m in  January 2014. The proceeds were distributed to noteholders on the April IPD.   The Brahms borrower is going through insolvency proceedings and minor further  recoveries are still possible. Nevertheless when the loan is fully resolved a  loss of around EUR20m will be allocated to the unrated classes I and J. With all loans in special servicing and undergoing different stages of  resolution, expected recoveries are highly dependent on the short-term market  conditions for secondary and tertiary real estate in Germany. Although investor  interest has returned to this market sector after years of subdued demand, the  achievable prices are still well below those seen in 2005-2007, when these loans  were originated. This level of stress is reflected by the below investment grade  ratings of the class B to F notes. The transaction benefits from a further  EUR78.8m credit enhancement offered by the unrated classes G to J notes.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Lower-than-expected recoveries in the remaining notes or an adverse turn in  market sentiment for secondary and tertiary assets in Germany could prompt a  negative rating action on the notes. Fitch estimates 'Bsf' collateral proceeds at between EUR270m-EUR290m. The latest surveillance data is available at the below link:
