BANGKOK, July 4 (Reuters) - The Philippine benchmark index hit a 13-month high on Friday, marking its best week since April, amid strong buying in shares of banks and property firms, while Indonesia notched its first weekly gain in a month ahead of the July 9 presidential election.

Shares of Bank of the Philippine Islands <BPI.PS> were up 1.3 percent, among the top performers, with other banks climbing on the week amid optimism around a planned law allowing foreign firms to take full control of Philippine lenders. [ID:nL4N0P82RY] Property shares were also among the top percentage gainers, with Megaworld Corp <MEG.PS> hitting a near one-month high as strong foreign demand for luxury condominiums in Manila bolstered the sector's outlook. [ID:nL3N0OG2QK] The Philippine composite index <.PSI> closed up 0.9 percent at a 13-month high of 6,962.68. It ended up 1.8 percent on the week, a second straight weekly gain. In Jakarta, foreign investors led the buying into selected large-caps, sending shares of Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> nearly 1 percent higher. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> rose 0.4 percent, on track for a 1.4 percent rise on the week. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> were range-bound as Asian stock markets edged higher after upbeat U.S. jobs data, which showed the lowest unemployment rate in six years and underscored the strength of the economic recovery.
