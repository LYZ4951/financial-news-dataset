July 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The ECB's update of the list of banks it considers significant enough to supervise directly largely reflects factors other than just size, Fitch Ratings says. The list shrunk to 120 institutions from 128 as a result of the removal of 12 and the addition of four. The banks taken off the list mostly have niche characteristics and business models that are more in line  with non-bank financial institutions, have reduced in size, or are less  domestically important. The new joiners are part of international groups, with  three having ultimate parents outside the eurozone, so cross-border activities  may be an influence in determining their significance. In Italy, Credito Valtellinese <PCVI.MI> (Creval) was removed from the list. It reduced  assets substantially with loans down 7% in 2013, more than other medium-sized  domestic peers. With 14 Italian banks included as significant, a good overview  of the Italian banking sector could probably be obtained without Creval. This is  also likely to be the reason why Credito Emiliano <EMBI.MI>, the second smallest Italian  bank on the original list, was also dropped even though it had EUR31bn assets at  end-1Q14, so above the EUR30bn threshold set. Other banks excluded include two captive vehicle finance companies in France,  one clearer  (LCH.Clearnet) and one central securities depository (Clearstream),  which do not have traditional bank models. Other leavers that are not typical  commercial banks included Germany's KfW IPEX-Bank, the commercial arm of  Europe's largest development bank, and specialised upper midmarket corporate  lender, IKB.  The newcomers include Barclays' Italian branch, surprising as it is the only  branch on the list. Barclays' gross exposure to Italy was EUR37bn at end-2013,  much of which would likely be in the local branch. We expect to see this shrink  as it is not strategic and Barclays wants to exit retail banking here. Barclays  also has operations in Spain and Portugal, but it is also downsizing its retail  and corporate business in these countries. Two Russian subsidiaries in Austria - Sberbank Europe and VTB Bank (Austria) -  may have been included because of their cross-border business with  Russian-related entities. The scale of international activities is one criteria  for determining significant institutions. Even including their respective  operations in other eurozone countries, these subsidiaries are small relative to  their parent groups. The banks could transfer some business to subsidiaries  outside the eurozone to reduce their activities and potentially be removed from  the list.  Belgium's Banque Degroof is the other new joiner, while Germany's Wuestenrot &  Wuerttembergische <WUWGn.DE>, Estonia's AS DNB Bank, and Ireland's Merrill Lynch  International Bank were also removed. Spain's CEISS was also taken off the list  as a separate entity as it is now included under its parent, Unicaja Banco.
