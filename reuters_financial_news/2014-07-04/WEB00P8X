VIENNA, July 4 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International's <RBIV.VI> business in Romania is holding up well, the Austrian lender said on Friday, a day after rival Erste Group <ERST.VI> said fresh hits from Hungary and Romania would push it to a record 2014 loss. [ID:nL6N0PE52Q]

"In Romania we continue to see good performance of our local operations so this is not really a problem for us," a spokeswoman for emerging Europe's second-biggest lender said.Erste said it faced increased risk provisions in Romania to reflect the central bank's stepped-up efforts to speed reductions of non-performing loans in the banking system ahead of ECB-led health checks of big European banks' balance sheets.
