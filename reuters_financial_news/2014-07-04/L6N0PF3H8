BUDAPEST, July 4 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank has withdrawn the licence of the small savings bank Orgovany es Videke due to serious shortcomings in its operations and has taken control of the bank, the central bank said in a statement on Friday.

Orgovany's share of the Hungarian banking market is less than 0.3 percent.
