SEOUL, July 4 (Reuters) - South Korean shares finished little changed on Friday after hitting a five-week high, as concerns over weak quarterly earnings undermined the impact from a strong U.S. jobs report.

The won <KRW=> also ended nearly flat at a six-year high. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.1 percent at 2,009.66 points after hitting an intraday high of 2,018.35, the highest since May 30.  For the week, the index gained 1.1 percent, logging the best week since mid-May. Steelmaker POSCO <005490.KS> added 1.2 percent while tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> slipped 0.9 percent.
