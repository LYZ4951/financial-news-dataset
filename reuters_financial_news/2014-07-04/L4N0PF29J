HONG KONG, July 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong has mandated HSBC <HSBA.L>, Standard Chartered <STAN.L>, CIMB Group Holdings <CIMB.KL> and National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> to arrange its first Islamic bond issue, IFR reported on Friday.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is handling the deal, which is expected in September, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, said citing sources close to the deal. The Islamic bond, or sukuk, is expected to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. It will likely have a tenor of 5 years and will be targeted at global institutional investors, Peter Pang, HKMA deputy chief executive, told a conference in April.
