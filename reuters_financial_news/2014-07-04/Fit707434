July 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed TeliaSonera AB's <TLSN.ST> (TeliaSonera) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed TeliaSonera's bonds' senior unsecured ratings at 'A-'. TeliaSonera continues to benefit from a well-diversified business portfolio,  strong cash flow, sound market position in most of its territories, and low  financial leverage relative to the European incumbent peer group - most of which  are rated at least one notch lower. FX volatility and the growing maturity of  some of its Eurasian markets - notably Kazakhstan, its single largest business  in the region - are expected to continue to dampen top-line growth. The company  is guiding to flat year-on-year 2014 revenue in local currency terms, while the  depreciation of a number of Eurasian currencies could, in Fitch's view, lead to  a modest revenue contraction in SEK terms.  Regulatory and governance pressures are present - again mainly concentrated in  the Eurasian businesses - while its European businesses are mature and facing  high competitive pressures. M&A risk is, in Fitch view, present and higher than  in the past, with potential for deals in either Spain or Norway, given the  sub-scale position held in these markets. TeliaSonera nonetheless is strongly  cash generative and, with net debt/EBITDA of 1.7x at FYE13 has rating headroom  to a downgrade guideline of 2.0x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Competition in Mature Nordics TeliaSonera's domestic markets are mature and competitive. Competition in  Sweden, a market accounting for 40% of group EBITDA (LTM 1Q14), is highly  developed in both fixed and mobile while market-wide trends suggest top-line  growth will be increasingly challenging to achieve. TeliaSonera's market  position is strong however, helped in the fixed consumer segment by a  progressive approach to fibre and a competitive TV offer.  Enterprise, accounting for roughly half of TeliaSonera's fixed revenues in  Sweden, remains under pressure however, with competition for public sector  contracts creating pricing tension and weighing on overall fixed revenues; 1Q14  LTM revenues in this division were down 4%.  Nordic telecom markets are some of the most progressive in Europe with consumers  used to high service quality and competitive pricing. These trends are unlikely  to ease. High Quality Eurasian Portfolio The diversity and market position held by TeliaSonera in it Eurasian operations  is impressive. It holds the number one or two positions in these markets  covering a population of close to 110 million, a number of which remain under  penetrated and which therefore continue to offer strong growth prospects.  Revenue growth in local currencies remains positive, albeit has slowed in  markets such as Kazakhstan, and an aggregate EBITDA margin above 50% is strong  and positive for the overall group margin. Presence in these markets,  nevertheless, gives rise to governance and regulatory pressures, although the  diversity of the portfolio provides some mitigation against shocks in any given  market.   Higher M&A Risk Recent comments from management suggest that M&A risk is more present than in  the past, with both Spain and Norway seen as markets where the company's  position is sub-scale and where acquisitions maybe considered. Previous attempts  to divest its Spanish business were unsuccessful, and management has stated that  a 7% market share is unsustainable.  The current push for market share in Spain and continued commitment to handset  subsidies is diluting what was already a weak margin and will continue to impact  financial performance in this market. A market number four position is an  anomaly in a portfolio where TeliaSonera is typically the market number one or  two. As a result M&A is a risk that could weaken leverage to the extent that  ratings would come under pressure.FX Volatility TeliaSonera benefits from a highly diversified portfolio; its traditional Nordic  operations are complemented by some well-positioned Baltic businesses and a  Eurasian portfolio accounting for approximately 30% of group EBITDA. The latter  in particular gives rise to a high degree of FX exposure, with recent volatility  in emerging market currencies having a dampening effect on the growth otherwise  delivered by these markets. Fitch's rating case assumes that markets such as  Uzbekistan and Nepal will continue to post solid underlying local currency  growth but that in the near term at least translation effects will drive  volatility and, in some cases, negate this growth in SEK terms. With exchange  rates likely to continue to be affected by policy decisions adopted by central  banks in many developed world economies, FX and the mismatch associated with  debt denominated in developed market currencies, is likely to remain a rating  pressure.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating actions include: Upside potential for the rating is limited. While a commitment to materially  more conservative financial policies could provide upward ratings pressure, this  is not deemed likely at present.  At the 'A-' rating level the company is among  the highest rated of Fitch's universe of European telecom operators. The  company's present operating and financial profile support the current rating,  notwithstanding the type of pressures (eg. market driven, governance, currency,  M&A) that exist in any given market.  Negative: Future developments that could, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:
