July 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded JCREF CMBS 2007-1 GK's class C and D notes due December 2015 and downgraded the class E notes. The transaction is a Japanese multi-borrower type CMBS securitisation. The details of the rating actions are as follows: JPY1.2bn* Class B notes affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable JPY5.2bn* Class C notes upgraded to 'BBBsf' from 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable JPY4.6bn* Class D notes upgraded to 'BBsf' from 'CCCsf'; Outlook Stable JPY2.6bn* Class E notes downgraded to 'Csf' from 'CCsf'; Recovery Estimate  revised to 30% from 0% *as of 3 July 2014  KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrades of the class C and D notes and the affirmation of the class B notes  reflect Fitch's view that these notes will be fully repaid; classes B and C in  September 2014 and class D by legal final maturity. Since the previous rating  action in August 2013, 15 properties have been sold at much higher values than  Fitch expected. As a result, the class A notes were paid in full in June 2014. According to the transaction structure, principal losses on defaulted loans will  not cause a reduction in the note principal until all available cash, including  that reserved in the transaction account, is applied to the note payment  following completion of all workout activities on defaulted loans. The downgrade of the class E notes reflects Fitch's view that principal loss on  the notes is inevitable as the workout of three defaulted loans has resulted in  a principal loss on the senior components backing the rated notes. However, the  workout has progressed better than previously expected and Fitch has revised the  Recovery Estimate of the class E notes to 30% from 0%.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Once workout activities on the remaining two defaulted loans are completed and  the transaction is terminated, the class E notes are likely to be written down  and downgraded to 'Dsf'.
