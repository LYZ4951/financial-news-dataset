July 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sunderland Marine Mutual  Insurance Company's (SMMI) Insurer Financial Strength Rating at 'A-' with a  Positive Outlook. At the same time, Fitch has withdrawn the rating.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch has withdrawn the rating as SMMI has decided to stop participating in the  rating process. Therefore, Fitch will no longer have sufficient information to  maintain the ratings on SMMI. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings  or analytical coverage for SMMI. The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the recent merger with  The North of England Protecting and Indemnity Association Limited (North), the  world's second-largest marine mutual liability insurer as measured by owned  tonnage, would improve SMMI's credit profile over time as part of a larger  group.
