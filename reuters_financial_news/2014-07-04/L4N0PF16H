SHANGHAI, July 4 (Reuters) - Chinese money rates traded slightly lower this week, making a smooth transition through the end of the first-half reporting period, which saw rates rise as companies stocked up on cash to meet regulatory rules and report to shareholders.

The weighted average of the seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.42 percent at midday on Friday, down 43 basis points from last week's close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> rose a milder 6 basis points to 2.95 percent.  Another actively traded tenor, the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, fell 192 basis points this week to trade at 3.50 percent on Friday.  "The money market has gone through the quarter-end smoothly. No liquidity squeeze has been spotted this week," a trader from a state-owned commercial bank in Beijing said. A trader from a state-owned commercial bank in Shanghai said she believes that even though commercial banks still need to pay in deposit reserves next week, the impact has not been reflected on price so far.  However, a trader from a city commercial bank in Shanghai said more volatility could be expected early next week because of cash demand from banks needing to make reserve deposits. Money market conditions have remained much looser this year than in the second part of last year. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has moved to maintain market confidence, injecting a net 55 billion yuan ($8.86 billion) into the money supply this week via open market operations.   In 2013, China's money market saw rates hit the stratosphere as the central bank held back on liquidity, which economists saw as a swipe at high-risk shadow banking. But this time around, few expected a recurrence.
