PARIS, July 4 (Reuters) - European Central Bank executive board member Christian Noyer said on Friday that the strong level of the euro currency weighed heavily on economic activity and inflation and that it would be logical for its level to depreciate.

"We have no exchange rate goal. But, it (the euro) is an element that weighs heavily on economic activity and inflation. It would be logical, given the disparity with the U.S. cycle, that the euro depreciate a bit," he told French magazine Investir.  Noyer also said the Eurosystem of European Central Bank and euro zone national central banks had the capacity to launch an asset-buying programme, though he said its effectiveness may be limited.
