COPENHAGEN, July 4 (Reuters) - Danish Financial Services Authority (FSA) has required Ostjydsk Bank <OJBA.CO> to book more loan impairments and because of that the bank do not meet solvency requirement any longer, which could result in a capital hike or sale of the bank.

The bank has hired Deloitte Corporate Finance as advisor on a process that should point on the bank's future direction. "The process includes probing the possibilities to obtain additional capital, and the potential for merger or sale of the bank," it said in statement. FSA told the bank to increase loan impairments by 216 million Danish crowns ($39.4 million) and because of that the bank is not able to meet the individual solvency requirement of 12.9 percent. After the new loan impairments the bank's individual solvency ration would be 10.2 percent. "The bank does not agree with the required impairment," it said in the statement. Ostjydsk Bank reported a loss of 150 million Danish crowns in 2013 and 281 million crowns in 2012. The bank has seven branches in eastern part of Jutland. The Danish economy has been sluggish since a property bubble burst in 2009 and more than 60 banks, mainly small ones, have gone out of business since 2008. Some have been bought by other banks while others went bankrupt.
