BUDAPEST, July 4 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank said compensating borrowers for unfair loan practices could cost the country's financial sector 600 to 900 billion forints ($2.63-$3.94 billion), based on a bill which parliament is expected to pass later on Friday.

However, this will not pose a risk to the stability of the bank sector, the central bank's press office said in a reply to Reuters questions.
