July 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Rural Hipotecario XVII F.T.A.'s mortgage-backed floating-rate notes due January 2057 a final rating, as follows: EUR90,000,000 class A notes assigned 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR11,124,000 loan B, unrated The transaction is a multi-originator securitisation of a EUR101m static pool of  Spanish residential mortgage loans, originated and serviced by Caja Rural (CR)  de Navarra [CARUN.UL] (BBB/Stable/F3) and the unrated entities CR de Aragon, CR de Granada  and CR the Teruel (the originators). The ratings address timely payment of  interest and ultimate payment of principal by the legal final maturity date of  the notes in January 2057.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's 'Bsf' rating loss rate assumption for the securitised portfolio (5.8%)  is relatively high compared with those of previous rated securitisations in the  same series (below 5%). The higher loss level is mainly driven by approximately  40% of the loans with above average original loan-to-value (OLTV) of up to 100%.  However, the portfolio's weighted average (WA) OLTV remains moderate at 75%. Fitch's analysis assumed all borrowers had a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 50%,  due to inconsistencies in income documentation identified during the file  reviews we conducted. The unadjusted WA DTI of the portfolio is 32%, based on  reported borrowers' income and a stressed base rate of 5%. We believe that the overall portfolio data quality is solid, despite  inconsistencies in income documentation. Deloitte conducted an external audit on  the loan-by-loan data templates provided by the originators, but the reported  income is usually not an audited field. The auditor reviewed 18 additional  loans' attributes and identified no material errors.   The structural credit enhancement (CE) totalled 20.5% at closing and is provided  by the subordination of loan B principal payments and a reserve fund of EUR9.6m.  Loan B interest payments rank senior to principal amortisation at closing, but  would be deferred in case gross cumulative defaults on the securitised portfolio  exceed 10%. A liquidity reserve fund (LRF) of EUR10.1m covers interest shortfalls resulting  from the difference between the WA margin of the loans (1.25% at closing) and  that of the notes (1.50%).  The LRF also provides a variable amount of CE, subject to the amortisation  profile of the class A notes. The LRF is drawn quarterly by an amount equivalent  to 0.3% of the outstanding balance of the notes. Drawn amounts in excess of  interest shortfalls may be used to amortise class A principal, in accordance  with the waterfall.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch's base case loss rate assumption for the securitised portfolio is 5.8%,  which is derived from a WA default assumption of 9.8% and WA recovery rate  expectation of 41%. The assumed WA loss rate in a 'A+sf' rating scenario is  17.1%.
