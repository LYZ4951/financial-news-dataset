NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. bond market posted a loss in July, its biggest since December, as shorter-dated yields hit their highest level in three years earlier this week on worries that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates sooner rather than later.

The Barclays U.S. Aggregate index, a widely followed gauge on the performance of Treasuries and other domestic investment-grade bonds, fell 0.25 percent last month. It was the second monthly decline so far in 2014 and the steepest decline since a 0.57 percent fall in December. Year-to-date, the index is up 3.66 percent, bouncing back from a 2.02 percent loss last year, which was its second biggest annual loss since 1976.  Most fixed-income categories suffered losses in July with the steepest declines in bonds backed by credit card, student and real estate loans, according to Barclays data. The Barclays index on mortgage-backed securities declined 0.59 percent last month, and its gauge on asset-backed securities fell 0.64 percent. While investment-grade U.S. bonds experienced a hiccup in July, high-yield, or junk, bonds were dealt a punch. The Barclays corporate high yield index tumbled 1.33 percent, its biggest fall since a 2.62 percent drop in June 2013. But municipal bonds, longer-dated Treasuries and Treasuries inflation-protected securities eked out modest gains. Treasuries that mature in 20 years or longer, as tracked by Barclays, produced a total return of 0.66 percent, the best U.S. bond category in July and so far in 2014. Year-to-date, these long-dated issues have generated a total return of 13.94 percent, supported by buying from investors who are nervous about the fighting in Ukraine and the Middle East and those overseas seeking low-risk alternatives that yield more than German and Japan debt. By comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500 index <.SPX> fell 1.51 percent in July, leaving it up 3.77 percent for the year-to-date.
