LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> said on Friday that a vote by Scotland to become independent from the rest of the United Kingdom could significantly increase its costs and have a material impact on its business.

RBS, which is 81 percent-owned by the British government, said earlier in the year that it was considering its options should Scots vote to end the 307-year union.
