CHICAGO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - CBOE Holdings Inc <CBOE.O> on Friday became the second exchange operator this week to say it will cut expenses in the face of weak trading volumes that are eating into profits.

Chicago-based CBOE, which runs the largest U.S. stock-options market, reduced its outlook for expenses in fiscal year 2014 to a range of $186 million to $190 million, from a previous range of $191 million to $196 million.  The company said net income in the second quarter fell to $42.6 million, or 50 cents per share, from $45.5 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were also 50 cents per share, meeting analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating revenue was $143.9 million, down from $150.8 million a year earlier and slightly beating estimates for $143.7 million. Exchange-operator CME Group Inc <CME.O> on Thursday said it would reduce hiring and travel expenses to compensate for weak trading volumes. [ID:nL2N0Q60N0]
