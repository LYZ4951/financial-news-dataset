PRAGUE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR>, the Czech Republic's third biggest bank by assets, posted a surprise 4.5 percent year-on-year rise in second-quarter net profit, lifted by lower than expected provisions for loan losses.

Attributable net profit reached 3.31 billion crowns ($160.31 million), above the average estimate of 3.01 billion in a Reuters poll.
