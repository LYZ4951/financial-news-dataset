MADRID, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Spanish stock market operator BME <BME.MC> reported on Friday a 16.3 percent rise in first-half net profit from a year earlier to 83.7 million euros ($112.03 million), driven by new listings and higher trading volumes as investors hunt for bargains after a long economic and financial crisis.
