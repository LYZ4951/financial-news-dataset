TURIN, Italy, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Fiat <FIA.MI> shareholders have approved the Italian carmaker's and its U.S. unit Chrysler's incorporation into a Dutch-registered entity on Friday, a move aimed at boosting the world's seventh-largest auto group's appeal with foreign investors and paving the way for a U.S. share listing.

The move was approved by a two-thirds majority, with 8 percent of all of Fiat's shareholders voting against.  Should all those that voted against the merger exercise their exit rights, the merger could still fail according to a condition set as part of the merger.  Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne completed the full buyout of Chrysler earlier this year and now plans to incorporate the two as Dutch-registered Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA).
