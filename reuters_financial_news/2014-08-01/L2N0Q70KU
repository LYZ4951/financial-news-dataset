WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - A top U.S. central banker said on Friday the U.S. Federal Reserve should ditch its pledge to hold interest rates low for a long time after it finishes a bond-buying program.

Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, was the lone dissenter in the U.S. central bank's policy decision published on Wednesday.  That decision, approved by the other nine voting members on the Fed's policymaking committee, said the Fed intends to hold a benchmark interest rate near zero for a "considerable time" after a bond-buying stimulus program ends. The bond purchases are on track to end in the fall. In a statement, Plosser said the economy was performing much better than policymakers had expected and that the pledge "may limit the committee's flexibility going forward." Some analysts and policymakers worry low interest rates could accelerate inflation, hurting the economy.
