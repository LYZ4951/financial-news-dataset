Aug 1 (Reuters) - Large volume in out-of-the-money put options expiring at the end of Friday's session was seen in multiple stocks Friday afternoon, including Priceline <PCLN.O>, Regeneron <REGN.O>, Chipotle <CMG.N>, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Traders in the options market wondered whether a glitch was causing some kind of spike in trading in contracts that are set to expire worthless by the end of the day.
