HONG KONG, Aug 1 (Reuters) - China shares fell in late action on Friday as investors braced for more volatility in global markets ahead of U.S. jobs data.

Markets had earlier gained on a surprisingly strong pick-up in manufacturing activity on the mainland that helped Chinese indexes hold at seven-month highs. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended a choppy session down 0.7 percent at 2,185.30 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings fell 0.9 percent. On the week, they were up 2.8 and 3.1 percent, respectively.
