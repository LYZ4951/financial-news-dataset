MUMBAI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell over 1.5 percent on Friday, marking its biggest single-day fall in nearly 3-1/2 weeks as blue-chips such as Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> slumped tracking weak global markets ahead of U.S. jobs data later in the session.

Caution ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review on Tuesday and foreign investor sales on Thursday also weighed. Reliance Industries provisionally fell 3 percent while Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS> ended down 2.9 percent.
