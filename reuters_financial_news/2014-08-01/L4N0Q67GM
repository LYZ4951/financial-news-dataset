Aug 1 (Reuters) - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc <HLT.N> raised its earnings forecast for 2014 and reported a 35 percent jump in quarterly profit as increased business travel drove up occupancy and room rates at most of its properties.

Hilton said it expects full-year adjusted profit of 67-70 cents per share this year, up from 64-67 cents. [ID:nBw2H9qGpa]
