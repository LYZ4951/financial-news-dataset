KAMPALA, Aug 1 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> gained on Friday against the dollar after the country's constitutional court struck down an anti-homosexuality law that punishes gay sex with long jail sentences, traders said.

At 1245 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,610/2,620, stronger than 2,618/2,628 before the ruling.
