PRAGUE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Czech lender Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR> expects its net profit to dip by 1.5 percent in 2014 and loan growth will not be as fast as previously thought, expanding by around 3 percent this year, Chief Finance Officer Libor Lofler said on Friday.

He said also that the bank, majority owned by France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, was not looking at changing its dividend policy at present. Komercni Banka had previously expected loan growth in 2014 of 3-5 percent. [ID:nL6N0Q71GZ]
