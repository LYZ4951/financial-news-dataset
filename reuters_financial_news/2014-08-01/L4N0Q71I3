SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Units in Accordia Golf Trust <ACCO.SI> started trading on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) at S$0.87 on Friday, 10 percent below its initial public offering price of S$0.97.

The S$758.6 million ($607.7 million) IPO of the trust backed by golf courses in Japan is the largest in Singapore so far this year, as the SGX struggles to boost its IPO pipeline as well as liquidity.
