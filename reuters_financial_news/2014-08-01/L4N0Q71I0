SHANGHAI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Chinese money rates dropped in volatile trading this week as the central bank sent mixed messages by draining cash from the market while lowering the rate on the repos in its open market operations, traders said.

The benchmark weighted average of the seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.89 percent by midday, down 23 basis points from last week's close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> was at 3.20 percent, down 17 basis points, while another actively traded maturity, the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, slumped 64 basis points this week to 4.27 percent. Traders said the seven-day repo rate had the potential to fall further next week to about 3.5 percent, partly after the central bank sent a signal to allow money market rates to drop. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) drained a net 11 billion yuan ($1.78 billion) from the interbank market via its open market operations this week -- the first time that the central bank conducted a net weekly drain since early May. [CN/MMT] But the PBOC lowered the interest rate it paid on 14-day repurchase agreements it conducted on Thursday to 3.7 percent, down from the previous 3.8 percent when it conducted the same business last time in April. "The mild drain showed the PBOC didn't want to loosen liquidity too much," said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai. "But the lower interest rate on its repos indicated that the central bank is acting in response to the pledge from the government to lower financing costs for economic activity. Overall, the mixed moves showed PBOC's intention to maintain a balance of money supply and demand in the market." China will continue to implement prudent monetary policy and maintain appropriate credit growth to help ease financing costs for domestic firms, Premier Li Keqiang told a regular cabinet meeting last week.
