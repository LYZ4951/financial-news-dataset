BEIJING, Aug 1 (Reuters) - A growing number of Chinese cities are relaxing property controls to support a cooling property market and safeguard the country's economic growth.

The unwinding of property controls is a turning point in China's housing policy, which has been steadily tightened by  since 2009 to calm frothy home prices. Many analysts now believe the slowing property market is the biggest risk to the world's second-largest economy. At least 23 regional governments, which earn a large chunk of their revenues by selling state land, have openly or quietly relaxed home purchase restrictions this year, according to data from CRIC, a unit of real estate services firm E-House China <EJ.N>. But about 20 out of the 46 governments have not budged, with higher downpayment levels and limits on the number of homes that residents can buy still in place for the fifth year to temper house prices, CRIC said.   Below are the measures that have been taken to bolster the property market.  ** Below are the cities that have removed the limits on the number of homes that residents and non-residents alike can buy, allowing them to own more than one home: Hefei of Anhui Province (Aug 2) Xuzhou of Jiangsu Province (Aug 1)  Wenzhou of Zhejiang Province (July 29) Shijiazhuang of Hebei Province (July 28)  Haikou of Hainan Province (July 23) Jinan of Shandong Province (July 10) Hohhot of Inner Mongolia Region (June 27)  ** The following cities have relaxed home purchase restrictions for properties of a certain size or which are located in specific districts: * Qingdao of Shandong Province (Aug. 1) Buyers can buy homes larger than 144 square metres in downturn areas.
