LISBON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Portugal's authorities are considering the use of public funds to shore up Banco Espirito Santo's capital, complementing a cash call from investors, people close to the process said on Friday.

One source said BES will likely need 3 billion euros ($4 billion) after a catastrophic 3.6 billion euro loss posted on Wednesday wiped out its capital buffers and reduced its solvency ratio below that required by the Bank of Portugal.
