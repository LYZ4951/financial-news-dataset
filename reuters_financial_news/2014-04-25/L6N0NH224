BUDAPEST, April 25 (Reuters) - Hungary's OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> could pay a "significantly higher" dividend on 2014 results if market uncertainties ease in a year's time, there are no specific acquisition targets and earnings are good, Chief Executive Sandor Csanyi said on Friday.

"We do not aim to increase our 16 percent core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio further," Csanyi told the annual general meeting of OTP shareholders.
