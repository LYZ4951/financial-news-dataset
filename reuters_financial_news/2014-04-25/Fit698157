April 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Want Want China Holdings Limited's <0151.HK> (Want Want) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A-'. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed Want Want's foreign-currency senior unsecured rating and the rating on wholly owned subsidiary Want Want China Finance  Limited at 'A-'. The affirmation reflects Want Want's strong 2013 performance with sales growth  of 13.7%, a stronger EBITDA margin of 25.3% and enhanced net cash position of  USD802m. Want Want continued to be the dominant player in niche packaged food  markets in China with strong operational and execution capabilities and prudent  financial position.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Dominant Position, Niche Products: Want Want is one of the most recognised  packaged food brands in China. Its key products - rice crackers, flavoured milk  and soft candies - dominate their respective niche product markets in China. Its  rice crackers, for instance, are traditional snacks eaten during the Lunar New  Year and demand surges ahead of the festival.  Management estimates that its market shares for key products range between 30%  and 70% of the Chinese market. Fitch notes that these estimates may be different  if the product categories are broadened. The agency, however, acknowledges Want  Want's dominance, as evidenced by its significant pricing power, and its ability  to defend its margins despite continuous increases in raw material prices and  labor costs in China. The company has kept EBIT margins well over 15% during the  last five years while maintaining a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.2%  for sales.  Extensive Distribution Network: One of Want Want's key strengths that cannot be  easily replicated is its nationwide exclusive distribution network of over 350  sales offices and around 8,000 distributors. The company uses this network to  expand its sales in Tier 3 and 4 cities and the modern organised retail route  for growth in Tier 1 and 2 cities. Want Want in 2013 restructured its sales  force into nine product divisions and divided China into 2,811 clusters, which  would help the company advance market segmentation, respond rapidly to changes  in demand patterns and further drive sales. Fitch believes that Want Want will be able to continue its organic growth by  expanding its distribution network in third, fourth and even fifth tier cities  while maintaining its market position and high margins.  Continued Margin Expansion: Want Want managed to increase its EBITDA margin by  184bps in 2013 to 25.3% due to strong pricing power, optimization of sales mix  and price declines for certain raw materials. Want Want will focus on launches  of new high-margin products in 2014 and Fitch expects Want Want to keep the  margin at this historical high level.  Net Cash Position: Want Want has maintained a conservative financial position,  with a net cash position since its IPO in 2008. This is a result of a continuous  positive free cash flow (FCF), the company's history of growing organically and  its aversion to acquisitions. Want Want's current ratings are based on Fitch's  view that the company will continue to maintain a net cash position. Limited Diversification: Want Want has a limited product portfolio compared with  global peers rated in the 'A' rating category (those rated 'A-', 'A' and 'A+'),  with just three main product categories. Its flavoured milk segment is dominated  by a single product, Hot Kid Milk. However, Want Want is trying to diversify its  portfolio by launching more new products, which are expected to be around 50-70  stock-keeping units (SKUs) in 2014 compared with 20-30 SKUs historically. Fitch  does not expect any material change to the product concentration factor over the  next two to three years.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -failure to maintain a net cash position  -organic growth falling below market rate or weakening of distribution networks  leading to EBIT margin falling below 15% on a sustained basis -increase in working capital, capex or dividend payout leading to failure to  maintain positive FCF
