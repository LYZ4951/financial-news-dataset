April 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised Italy's Outlook to Stable  from Negative. At the same time the agency has affirmed Italy's Long-term  foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB+'. The issue  ratings on Italy's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds were also  affirmed at 'BBB+'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'AA+' and the  Short-term foreign currency IDR at 'F2'.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  The revision of the Outlooks to Stable from Negative reflects the following key  rating drivers, all of which are of medium weight: - The deep and prolonged recession of the Italian economy ended in 2H13, in line  with Fitch's previous forecasts. - The Italian sovereign has benefited from a significant improvement in  financing conditions since mid-2012. The average issuing yield was 1.6% in 1Q14,  a historical low. Furthermore, Italy demonstrated financing flexibility and  resilience during the sovereign debt crisis and the average life of gross  general government debt (GGGD) was 6.4 years at end-2013.  - Contingent fiscal risks from the financial sector have declined as larger  Italian banks took advantage of improved market conditions to strengthen capital  ahead of the ECB's comprehensive asset quality review and some EUR10bn new share  issues have been announced to date. Debt issuance of Italian banks in 1Q14 was  markedly higher compared with the previous year. - Italy had a current account surplus in 2013, the first time since the  financial crisis. Fitch expects the surplus to widen in 2014, driven by stronger  export demand, not least from eurozone partners, while imports will remain  subdued due to the weakness of domestic demand. Italy's 'BBB+' IDRs also reflect the following key rating factors:- GGGD will peak at 135% of GDP in 2014, marginally higher than Fitch's previous  forecast (133% of GDP), due to weaker nominal GDP growth. Fitch expects GGGD to  decline slowly and remain above 130% of GDP until 2017, compared with the 'BBB'  median of 40%. The high debt leaves very limited fiscal space to respond to any  adverse shock.  - The new government of Matteo Renzi announced a structural reform agenda with  an ambitious timetable and confirmed in the 2014 Stability Programme the  previous governments' commitment to the eurozone fiscal framework, in  particular, keeping deficit below 3% of GDP in 2014 and maintaining the  medium-term fiscal consolidation path. - Labour market indicators and inflation highlight the fragility of the economy.  Unemployment increased to 13% in February 2014, as employment continued to fall  and annual inflation declined to 0.3% in March 2014.   - The Italian economy contracted by a cumulative 4.1% since mid-2011,  experiencing one of the sharpest recessions among eurozone members. Italy's  average GDP growth over the last five years was negative 1.5% versus the 'BBB'  median of positive 3.2% growth. Notwithstanding the cyclical improvements,  Italy's growth potential is weak, compared with both rating peers and eurozone  members. - Following the substantial pro-cyclical fiscal consolidation in 2012 and 2013  during the recession, the government will not tighten the fiscal stance in 2014.  According to the Stability Programme the government will use the limited fiscal  flexibility created by savings from the spending review to support the economy  through tax cuts in the short run. Consequently Fitch forecasts public sector  deficit at close to 3% of GDP in 2014, for the third consecutive year.  - Net external debt was high at 56% of GDP at end-2013, compared with the 'BBB'  range median of 9%.  - The ratings are supported by a large, fairly wealthy, high value-added and  diversified economy with moderate levels of private sector indebtedness and a  sustainable pension system.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that upside and downside risks to  the rating are currently balanced.   Factors that may, individually or collectively, result in a negative rating  action are: - Political turmoil resulting in paralysed economic and fiscal policies, or  weakening political support for the medium-term fiscal consolidation path  - Nominal and real economic shocks or fiscal measures that reduce confidence  that GGGD/GDP will be placed on a downward path   Factors that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action  are: - Stabilisation of GGGD/GDP and increasing confidence that it will be firmly  placed on a downward path - Sustained and broad-based economic recovery, including an acceleration in  nominal GDP growth  - Marked decline in the net external debt to GDP ratio  KEY ASSUMPTIONS The ratings incorporate Fitch's assumption that following a broadly unchanged  budget deficit (close to 3% of GDP) in 2014 the primary balance will improve in  2015 and 2016 and the underlying fiscal stance will converge towards the  balanced budget requirement over the medium term. The European Commission's  assessment of the draft 2014 budget highlights that Italy needs further measures  to fully comply with the reinforced Stability and Growth Pact.  Fitch maintains its assumption that real GDP will grow by 0.6% in 2014 and 1% in  2015. Growth will not accelerate substantially further over the medium term,  notwithstanding the various rounds of structural reforms proposals and the  closing of the likely large negative output gap. The EUR50bn-60bn (3.2%-3.5% of  GDP) repayment of commercial arrears during 2013-14 would not provide a large  impetus to the economy, but would rather help to mitigate downside risks to  Fitch's base case.   Fitch assumes that Italy will avoid deflation. Based on its real economic  forecast and a  gradual increase in inflation from the current low level Fitch  assumes in its debt sustainability analysis that the nominal growth of the  Italian economy will remain below 3% until 2018. Therefore, interest rate-growth  differential will remain positive for an extended period, despite the  substantial fall in sovereign yields, requiring a large primary surplus to  ensure a decline of the high debt/GDP ratio.  Fitch assumes that methodological changes due to the implementation of the new  ESA 2010 accounting rules will not have a material impact on GGGD/GDP ratio and  its dynamics.  Fitch assumes the gradual progress in deepening fiscal and financial integration  at the eurozone level will continue; key macroeconomic imbalances within the  currency union will be slowly unwound; and eurozone governments will tighten  fiscal policy over the medium term.
