HANOI, April 25 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks tracked losses in broader Asia on Friday with investors taking profits in Singapore, while the Thai index was dragged lower after a net selling session by foreign investors.

Asian stocks struggled as fears of an escalating Ukraine crisis eclipsed upbeat U.S. economic data and robust U.S. tech shares. [ID:nL3N0NH06J] The Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> retreated 0.44 percent from a near-11-month closing high on profit-taking, mostly in banking stocks, analysts said. [ID:nL3N0NH1I3] The Singapore stock market has risen as much as 11.2 percent since its 2014 low hit in early February, Reuters data showed. Thailand's SET Index <.SETI> also drifted lower, extending Thursday's losses with foreign investors becoming net sellers after 10 straight net-buying sessions, Reuters data showed. Indonesia <.JKSE> and Vietnam <.VNI> bucked the trend to advance 0.39 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. But low volumes indicated weak buying demand in both markets. Stocks in Malaysia <.KLSE> dipped 0.15 percent and the Philippine SE Composite Index <.PSI> edged down 0.39 percent.
