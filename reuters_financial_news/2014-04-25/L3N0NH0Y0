SEOUL, April 25 (Reuters) - South Korean shares fell to their lowest level in four weeks on Friday as softer-than-expected earnings reports dragged down heavyweights such as Hyundai Motor.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 1.3 percent at 1,971.66 points, the weakest close since March 28. The index fell 1.6 percent for the week, snapping a five-week winning streak that began in mid-March. Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> dropped 2.5 percent after posting a worse-than-expected earnings for the January-March quarter.
