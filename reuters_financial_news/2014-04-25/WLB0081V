DUBLIN, April 25 (Reuters) - The asset sale from the liquidation of the former Anglo Irish Bank will allow the government to fully repay the 12.9 billion euros ($17.8 billion) of bonds issued to take over its debt, Ireland's finance department said on Friday.

Liquidators sold more than 90 percent of the bank's loan book with a par value of 21.7 billion euros in recent months without disclosing how much it received. The remaining assets will no longer need to be transferred to the state-run National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), the government said.
