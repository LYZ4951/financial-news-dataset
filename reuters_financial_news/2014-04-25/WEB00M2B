VIENNA, April 25 (Reuters) - Austrian bank Erste Group <ERST.VI> said it did not foresee any immediate change to its strategy in Hungary after the central bank there said it would stop issuing two-week bills in August.

"We see no direct influence on our strategy in Hungary for the time being," a spokeswoman said on Friday, adding that Erste would seek talks with the central bank to clarify the situation.
