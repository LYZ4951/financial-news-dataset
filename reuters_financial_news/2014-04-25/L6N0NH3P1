LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - British foreign exchange company Travelex [TRVLXP.UL] is seeking to float in May or June this year, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, in a deal which one said could value the company at over 1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion).

JP Morgan <JPM.N> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> will lead the London listing, one of the sources said. Travelex, which is owned by private equity firm Apax Partners [APAX.UL], said last month that it was considering a stock market flotation.
