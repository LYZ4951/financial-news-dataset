HONG KONG, April 25 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities detained last week two senior executives at units of China Resources Holding Co. Ltd [CHRESR.UL], the South China Morning Post reported on Friday, as the chairman of the state-run conglomerate is being investigated for corruption.

Wang Hongkun, an executive director of China Resources Land <1109.HK> and Wu Ding, chief executive of China Resources Capital Holdings, were detained last Thursday, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. China Resources Land, in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse this week, had said Wang had resigned due to personal health reasons. It declined to comment on the newspaper report.[ID:nWNBS00FGH] A Hong Kong-based spokesperson at parent company China Resources Holdings also declined to comment. China Resources Capital executives were not immediately available to comment. China Resources Holding has businesses spanning energy land and consumer products and services in mainland China and Hong Kong.
