TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - Japan's NTT DoCoMo Inc <9437.T> said on Friday it would exercise the option to sell its 26.5 pct stake in Tata Teleservices Ltd [TATASL.UL] by June if the Indian mobile phone joint venture failed to achieve performance targets for the financial year that ended last month.

The sale price would be 72.5 billion rupees ($1.19 billion) - the equivalent to half of the original acquisition price - or a "fair market price", whichever was higher, as agreed when DoCoMo made the initial investment in 2009, Japan's top mobile phone services operator said in a statement.
