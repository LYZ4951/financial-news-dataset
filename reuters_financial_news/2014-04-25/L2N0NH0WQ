April 25 (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank kept interest rates on hold at a record low on Friday, highlighting signs of improving growth and tame price pressures in Latin America's second largest economy.

For the full story [ID:nL2N0NH0TJ] The following is an unofficial translation of the central bank's statement accompanying its decision: The global economy has continued to recover moderately, mainly driven by some advanced economies. In the United States, after weakening was observed at the beginning of the year largely due to climatic factors, the economy picked up greater momentum. It is expected that economic activity in the country will continue to strengthen in the coming months and that, although inflation is expected to remain at low levels, the Federal Reserve will continue the gradual process of normalizing monetary policy.   Accordingly, in recent weeks there has been a decrease in uncertainty in international financial markets, which has renewed capital flows to emerging markets, and strengthened those towards countries at the periphery of the euro area. In that area, the recovery remains fragile and the available information suggests that very low inflation will prevail for an extended period, and that in some countries there is even a risk of deflation.  In emerging markets, growth expectations continue to be revised downwards, mainly reflecting the development of domestic demand and a slowdown in China. Conditions in the financial markets of these economies have stabilized recently, partly due to policy responses in some of them, but mainly due to a more favorable perception of monetary policy in the United States, which could change in the future.  On balance, the outlook for global economic growth has improved marginally, overriding certain downside risks. Meanwhile, it is expected that global inflation continues at a low level and, in the case of most advanced economies, even below the target of their central banks. It is therefore expected that those banks will maintain their accommodative posture of monetary policy for a prolonged period. The available information on economic activity in Mexico in the first quarter suggests a lower than expected growth than a few months ago. However, at the margins, some components of aggregate demand have begun to show a more favorable performance. In particular, exports have increased and government spending has shown signs of being more dynamic. Also, there has been an improvement seen in some indicators of consumption and private investment. On the other hand, although new jobs continue to be created, conditions of ample slack remain in both the labor market and the economy as a whole. In short, the view is that downside risks to economic activity growth remain, though the balance of these improved marginally. In any case, we do not perceive pressures on inflation derived from the expected behavior of aggregate demand. As anticipated, since the second half of January annual headline inflation has shown a downward trend to settle at levels well below 4 percent. The trajectory of annual core inflation has also been favorable. In particular, after its monthly variation jumped in January 2014, the levels for February and March were the lowest for those months on record.  As for annual non-core inflation, its recent decline is mainly due to the fading of the adverse effects of climatic shocks that in previous months affected the subindex of agricultural products. Thus, the changes in relative prices that occurred in late 2013 and early 2014, including derivatives taxation measures, did not lead to second-round effects on the process of pricing in the economy. Reflecting this, inflation expectations for this year have been revised downward to below 4 percent, while those corresponding to longer-term horizons have remained stable. In sum, it is considered that the balance of risks associated with inflation remain unchanged from the previous decision. Considering all of the above, the Board of Governors has decided to maintain the 3.50 percent rate for the daily interbank interest rate, by virtue of the fact that it is estimated that the monetary policy stance is consistent with the efficient convergence of inflation toward the 3 percent target. However, the Board will remain attentive to all pressures that might affect inflation and its expectations in the medium and long term, in particular the development of the degree of slack in the economy.
