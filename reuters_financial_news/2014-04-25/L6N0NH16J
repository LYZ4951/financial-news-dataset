STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Reuters) - Swedish banking group SEB <SEBa.ST> reported on Friday a bigger-than-expected rise in first-quarter operating profit on the back of strong commission income but sounded a warning over uncertainties due to events in Ukraine.

SEB's operating profit in the quarter rose to 4.9 billion Swedish crowns ($739 million), beating a mean forecast for 4.7 billion in a Reuters poll and compared with 3.7 billion in the year-ago period.  NICK ANDERSON, ANALYST AT BERENBERG "Basically the numbers all look absolutely fine to me. Net income was better than expected, revenues missed but I don't think it's anything that will worry anyone too much. Costs were much better than expected and it's always a big positive to have costs under control."  "That's the joy for Swedish banks that they don't tend to have any real surprises and I think that's why investors love the stock so much."
