STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Reuters) - Private equity firms Nordic Capital and Apax have appointed financial advisers for a planned stock market listing of Swedish health care group Capio, Swedish business daily Dagens Industri reported in its weekend edition.

Citing sources, Dagens Industri said the private equity firms had hired JP Morgan and Carnegie to advise on a listing likely to take place this fall, but that the owners might also opt to sell the group outside the stock market.
