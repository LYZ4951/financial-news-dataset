WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - A magnitude 4.7 earthquake struck on Friday off the coast of Oregon in the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Geological Survey said, but it did not trigger a tsunami warning.

The USGS said the quake, which was only 6.2 miles (10 km) below the seabed, was centered 132 miles (213 km) west of Bandon, Oregon.
