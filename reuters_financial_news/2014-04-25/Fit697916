April 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Intralot SA's  (Intralot) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+' and revised the Outlook  to Negative from Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the  EUR325m 9.75% Eurobond due in August 2018, issued  by the company's wholly-owned entity Intralot Finance Luxembourg S.A. at  'BB-'and assigned Intralot's wholly-owned entity Intralot Capital Luxembourg  SA's planned bond issue of EUR200m an expected senior unsecured rating of  'BB-'(EXP)'/RR3'. The final ratings for these bonds are contingent upon receipt  of final documentation conforming to information already received by Fitch. The new EUR200m 2021 senior unsecured (S/U) bond issue will repay around EUR147m  of revolving credit facility (RCF) drawings and local loan debt, while EUR50m  will be used as a cash buffer. The precise use of this EUR50m new cash has not  been earmarked but can be used for capex, working capital or acquisition  purposes. Fitch estimates that there could be a material negative carry back  from low-earning large cash deposits in 2014, which could adversely affect  credit metrics, notably fixed charge coverage (FCC) and funds from operations  (FFO) gross and net leverage. The EUR200m S/U bond will maintain gross leverage   between 4.5x and 5.0x in 2014, although net leverage will remain between 3.2x  and 3.5x in 2014 and 2015. Fitch is focussing on the gross leverage ratio, as we  have limited visibility regarding the excess cash available for debt service and  this justifies the Negative Outlook.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Senior Unsecured Ranking The planned EUR200m 2021 bond will be issued by Intralot Capital Luxembourg  S.A., a Luxembourg-based financial vehicle wholly owned by Intralot through  Intralot Global Securities B.V. ranking as a senior unsecured obligation pari  passu with its bank debt. It benefits from guarantees from Intralot SA and  Intralot Global Securities BV and by the main operating subsidiaries of Intralot  Global Securities B.V. These guarantors will account for approximately 65% of  group assets and EBITDA.   Bond Notched Up from IDR  Fitch considers that expected recoveries upon default would be maximised in a  going-concern scenario rather than in liquidation given the asset-light nature  of Intralot's business. Fitch has applied a discount of 30% to Intralot's FY13  consolidated EUR192m EBITDA to reflect downside risks as well as the material  minority interests in some of its subsidiaries and a 4x distressed multiple to  derive a distressed enterprise value of EUR537m. Taking into account the new  debt structure including the EUR150m RCF as fully drawn, we assess the recovery  rate for the senior notes in the 51%-70% range ('RR3') leading to a one-notch  uplift to the senior unsecured rating from the IDR of 'B+'.   Adequate Post-Issuance Liquidity  Intralot will use the bond proceeds to repay around EUR147m of RCF and local  loan debt, while  aroundEUR50m will be used as a cash buffer. Together with  around EUR146m of existing cash, Intralot should have sufficient liquidity to  repay the remaining EUR80m term loan due in December 2014, should the term loan  facility and the current RCF EUR150m facility not be refinanced. Intralot is  also working to improve its liquidity by refinancing the existing EUR150m RCF  facility and EUR80m term loan, which both mature in December 2014. Fitch  understands that subject to documentation the company has received over EUR200m  of commitments from their bank group for the refinancing of these credit  facilities.  The ratings are premised on the successful issuance of the prospective notes, so  that sufficient liquidity is available to repay the RCF and term loan debt  maturing in December 2014.  Fitch would expect Intralot to raise at least EUR100m to retain sufficient  liquidity.  Solid Operations, Higher Leverage Leverage at end-2013 was higher than Fitch forecast due to higher interest  costs, working capital requirements and tax paid. Fitch expects gross leverage  to stay between 4.5x and 5.0x in 2014. Should Intralot make a profit accretive  acquisition and/or repay debt, leverage could reduce back to a level  commensurate with the 'B+' guideline.   Low Free Cash Flow  Free cash flow (FCF) should remain positive in 2014 due to a significant  reduction of capex, but will be held back by increased working capital  requirements and increased taxation in line with the expansion of the business.   A factor of cash flow absorption is linked to the significant proportion of  EBITDA that does not belong to Intralot (although fully consolidated), linked to  joint ventures. This resulted in approximately EUR17m of annual minority  dividend distributions in 2013, which reduced FFO and ultimately FCF in 2013.  Solid Track Record The 'B+' IDR reflects its established track record of winning and retaining high  profile gaming contracts, steady EBITDA growth from its licensed operations  division and a well- diversified contract portfolio. The ratings are however  held back by the low credit quality of some of the countries in which the  company operates, the important role and dividends paid to minorities, rising  tax paid and the increasing working capital requirements of this expanding  business.   Limited Linkage with Greece  Intralot generates only 5% of its revenues and less than 10% of its EBITDA in  Greece. While its management and a major proportion of its software developers  and machine designers are based in Greece, overall Greece-based employees only  account for 15% of the total. As of YE13 less than 10% of group cash was lodged  in Greece or Cyprus.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include: - Positive EBITDA growth derived from stronger return on capital on existing and  future contracts with limited capex outlays. - FFO-based net lease adjusted leverage reducing sustainably below 3.0x (FFO  gross lease adjusted leverage below 4.0x), with cash deposited predominantly in  investment grade-rated counterparties. - FFO fixed charge cover above 4.0x, unaided by favourable interest carry. - Evidence of sustained positive FCF generation.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  stabilisation of the rating Outlook include: Positive EBITDA growth derived from stronger return on capital on existing and  future contracts with limited capex outlays. - FFO-based net lease adjusted leverage reducing sustainably below 3.5x (FFO  gross lease adjusted leverage below 4.5x), with cash deposited predominantly in  investment grade-rated counterparties. - FFO fixed charge cover around 3.0x, unaided by favourable interest carry. - Evidence of sustained positive FCF generation.   Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: - Evidence that new contracts or renewals are occurring at materially less  favourable conditions for Intralot, such as lower margins, large upfront  concession fees or capex outlays. - FFO-based net lease adjusted leverage sustainably above 4.0x (FFO gross lease  adjusted leverage above 5.0x). - FFO fixed charge cover below 2.0x.
