OSLO, April 25 (Reuters) - Handelsbanken no longer expects Norges Bank to cut rates around summer, and sees the first rate hike in December 2015, it said in its new macro forecast on Friday.

"Our main scenario is on the weak side of Norges Bank's expectations, but we do not expect an interest rate cut over the forecast horizon even though we would have considered that desirable," the bank said.  Handelsbanken added that Norges Bank has revealed a strong preference to respond to a weaker outlook by simply postponing future rate hikes rather than easing, and that recent cuts by several banks in their lending and deposit rates strengthen this argument. Norges Bank signalled in March that the first hike could come around summer 2015.
