HANOI, April 25 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stocks fell on Friday, with political uncertainty driving Thai equities down and profit-taking stretching losses to a third day in the Philippines.

Bangkok's SET Index <.SETI> lost 1.02 percent, its biggest drop in six weeks, as fears mount that the country's lengthy political crisis could move into a more violent phase as the Thai government was to ask the army to deploy more troops in the capital. [ID:nL3N0NH3AD] Siam Cement PCL <SCC.BK> was the biggest loser, with its shares tumbling 3.14 percent, followed by Kasikornbank PCL <KBANK.BK> which fell 2.61 percent. Investors on the Philippine bourse secured profits from recent rallies, dragging the benchmark down 1.5 percent over three straight sessions. The Philippine SE Composite Index <.PSI> has faced some strong selling pressure around its resistance level of 6,800 while upside momentum has slowed down, said market strategist Manny Cruz at Asiasec Equities. The index lost 0.69 percent to close at 6685.1, trimming its gain of as much as 13.6 percent since early February. "We are looking at a week or two for the market to shed some more," Manny added. Stocks in Malaysia <.KLSE> and Singapore <.FTSTI> also lost ground on Friday, while Indonesia's Jakarta SE Composite Index <.JKSE> bucked the trend to edge up 0.13 percent. Vietnam <.VNI> rose 1.5 percent, but thin trade and lack of supportive news could pull the index down soon, analysts said. [ID:nL3N0NH34Q]
