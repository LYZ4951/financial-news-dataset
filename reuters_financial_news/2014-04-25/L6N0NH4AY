MILAN, April 25 (Reuters) - Italian asset manager Azimut <AZMT.MI> is looking to considerably boost its business outside Italy and is currently mulling acquisitions in Asia and Latin America, the company's CEO told Reuters on Friday.

Azimut, which had a portfolio of 25.6 billion euros ($35 billion) at the end of March, generates some five to six percent of its assets under management abroad and expects that to reach 10 percent by the end of the year and keep on rising. "I expect at least 35 percent of our business to be generated abroad in around five to ten years time," Pietro Giuliani said in the interview. Last year the firm sealed two deals in Brazil [nL6N0JR1KC] and it already operates in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan and Singapore. "We don't exclude Africa," Giuliani said, adding that Turkey was also an area of interest "as a door into the Middle East". Most of the large asset managers in Italy, both domestic and international, are bank owned, leaving Azimut as one of the country's biggest independent groups. At the end of last year it had a net cash position of 364 million euros and raised 250 million euros from a convertible bond launched last November. Increasing competition from international companies setting up shop in Italy has prompted some domestic groups to consider acquisitions closer to home to bulk up their size to better compete. But Giuliani said it was not the time right now to buy assets in Italy since valuations were too high. "While before there was an exaggerated generalized rush to all emerging markets to the detriment of the whole of the European periphery, today we are running the opposite risk," he said. "Since November 2011, when Italy seemed on the verge of collapse, to today... what has changed structurally in Italy?" Azimut has a market value of 3.2 billion euros. Its shares have risen around 240 percent in the last two years.
