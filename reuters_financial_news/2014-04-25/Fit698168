April 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Moroccan fertiliser producer  OCP S.A.'s (OCP) USD1.25bn 5.625% notes due 2024 and USD300m 6.875% notes due  2044 final 'BBB-' ratings.  The notes are rated at the same level as OCP's senior unsecured debt rating as  they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations  of the company and will rank pari passu will all existing and future senior  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuer. Covenants include a  negative pledge with permitted liens. Events of defaults include cross default  to any debt of the borrower, or its material subsidiaries with a USD25m  threshold. For certain events of default, a threshold of 5% in aggregate of  notes then outstanding is required to call an event of default. The notes are  also subject to a change of control clause. Proceeds are being used to fund OCP's capital expenditure programme and for  general corporate purposes. The final ratings are in line with the expected  ratings assigned on 3 April 2014 and follow the review of the final bond  documentation which conformed to the drafts previously received.  OCP's ratings reflect its vertical integration, competitive cost position,  exceptionally large ore reserves, and its leading market positions in phosphoric  acid and phosphate rock. The ratings also capture the progress to date on OCP's  transformational expansion strategy, which should translate in the near term  into material cost savings, capacity increases and enhanced product  diversification and production flexibility.  Constraints include the group's exposure to the phosphate fertiliser cycle; in  particular investment spending is peaking at a time when market conditions are  softening. Given its 94% state ownership and strategic importance for the  Moroccan economy, OCP's IDR cannot be higher than Morocco's Country Ceiling of  'BBB'. The Stable Outlook reflects our view that the group has sufficient flexibility  to maintain credit metrics commensurate with its ratings through to 2016,  despite volatile pricing conditions and its high investment requirements.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Moderate Rebound from 2013 Trough  Our base rating case assumes a marginal pricing improvement on the 2013 averages  for phosphate products. Prices have increased so far in 2014, driven by strong  demand from Brazil, stock building ahead of the planting season and supply  disruptions in the Middle-East and North Africa. Low demand from India and  exports from China remain key potential downside risks. While visibility on  India's 2014/15 fertiliser subsidy remains clouded by its economic downturn, we  assume a moderate rebound from 2013 levels given depleted phosphate stocks in  the country. Chinese exports could disrupt the market in 2H14, particularly  after a reduction in the phosphates export tariffs.  Pipeline to Enhance Cost Position Our 2014 base case incorporates the commissioning of the 234km slurry pipeline  that links OCP's Khourigba phosphate rock mine to the processing hub of Jorf  Lasfar. Construction works have been completed and the pipeline is under trial  runs. With an annual capacity of up to 35 million tonnes (mt), it should  considerably reduce requirements for energy, water, and road and rail  transportation.  We forecast an improvement in profitability in 2014, reflecting the enhanced  cost base and, to a lesser extent, higher capacity utilisation rates and lower  raw material costs. Under our base case, EBITDA margin is projected to increase  to and remain above 30% from 2014 onwards, from 23% in 2013. Given its near-term  positive effect on the group's cost position, we regard the successful launch of  the pipeline as a key rating driver.   Progress on Transformational Capex Programme In our view, the execution risk associated with the 2008-2016 phase of OCP's  investment programme (including the slurry pipeline) has reduced materially with  the progress made to date. The expansion of the mines (open pit) and  beneficiation plants will yield a 5mt increase in annual phosphate rock  production capacity to 35.1mt by 2016. At Jorf Lafsar, OCP has built two  granulation plants with an annual aggregate capacity of 1.7mt and is completing  four identical fully integrated fertiliser production units of 1mt each to be  commissioned starting 2014 and through to 2016. In parallel, Jorf Lasfar's port  infrastructure and storage facilities are also being expanded.  Leverage Increases on High Capex OCP's fund from operations (FFO) gross and net adjusted leverage increased to  3.5x and 2.7x respectively at end-2013, from 1.5x and 0.8x. This is slightly  above the upper limit for the current ratings and reflects record investment  levels (MAD21bn) and poor market conditions in 2013. Under our base case, net  leverage is sustained within the expected range at 2.0x-2.5x over 2014-2016.  This assumes annual capex being sustained at an average of MAD22bn (partly  debt-funded), which in our view can be scaled back in the event of a downturn.  This also assumes a gradual improvement in operating cash flow generation  primarily on the back of the cost efficiencies and new capacity.  Sound Liquidity At end-2013, OCP had cash and cash equivalent reserves of MAD6bn against short-  term debt of MAD5.9bn. Liquidity was also supported by long-term committed  unused facilities totalling MAD7.7bn. The company also had short-term investment  (tenors above 90 days) of MAD4.6bn. Under our base case, free cash flow (FCF) is  expected to remain negative due to the high capex levels and we assume that OCP  will continue to access the domestic and international bank and debt capital  markets for its investment and refinancing needs. Other cash requirements  include contributions to its private pension plan and dividend payments, which  we believe can be tailored to match fluctuations in the group's cash flow  generation.   Exposure to Cyclicality and Volatility OCP is less diversified across nutrients than some of its competitors and its  ratings are constrained by its exposure to the phosphate fertilisers cycle.  While demographic growth and reduced arable land support long-term demand  fundamentals for fertilisers, volatility in both pricing and demand is high and  dictated by factors outside of producers' control. Erratic demand patterns from  key consumers (e.g. India), adverse weather conditions or capacity additions can  translate into material declines in cash flow generation. In mitigation,  improvements in cost position, production flexibility and arbitrage options  should afford OCP an increasing degree of flexibility during market downturns.   State Ownership Despite its 94% state-ownership, OCP's ratings are not linked to that of Morocco  (BBB-/Stable). We have assessed the operating and legal ties under Fitch's  Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage methodology and regard them as weak. We  view the group's ongoing transformation and strategic focus as evidence of an  independently run profit-oriented business model with little influence from the  state. Nevertheless, given OCP's strategic importance for the Moroccan economy,  negative pressure on the sovereign's rating may have implications for OCP and  would lead us to review the government's stance towards the group. Any resulting  adverse changes to the credit standing of OCP could lead to a negative rating  action.   Key Man Risk The departure of Mr Mostafa Terrab, OCP's CEO and Chairman, and resulting  succession risk could put pressure on the ratings. Although we recognise the  high calibre and experience of the senior management team, Mr Terrab's vision  and influence are critical to the successful execution of OCP's expansion  strategy.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Although not envisaged over the next one to two years, future  developments that could lead to positive rating action include:  - Successful completion of the expansion programme with fundamental improvements  in OCP's resilience to phosphate cyclicality  - Net FFO net adjusted leverage sustained below 1.5x; and  - Positive FCF generation through the cycle  Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - EBITDA margins dropping below 15% (FY13: 23%) and/or FFO net leverage  sustained above 2.5x indicating fundamental trends contrary to the base rating  case - Departure of Mr Terrab and resulting succession risk
