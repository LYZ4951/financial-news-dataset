FRANKFURT, April 25 (Reuters) - Banks will return 9.579 billion euros ($13.24 billion) in crisis loans to the European Central Bank next week, more than expected, pushing the amount of extra cash in the system further into critical territory.

The amount banks will repay on April 30 is more than this week's repayments of 7.536 billion euros, and above the 5.0 billion forecast in a Reuters poll. [ECB/REFI] "EMU banks are slowly repaying their loans and the large redemption of Spanish bonds next week (more than 15 billion euros) might partially explain the slight pick-up in repayments," said Newedge Strategy analyst Annalisa Piazza. Banks are voluntarily offloading the crisis loans they took from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012 in anticipation of Europe-wide bank stress tests, which will over the next couple of months check how the lenders hold up under certain scenarios. The tests are part of a broader balance sheet review done by ECB before it takes over as bank supervisor in November.  Euro zone banks repaid on average 10.5 billion euros per week in March and 7.6 billion on average in April.   The pace has slowed somewhat as the level of liquidity in the system beyond what banks need for their day-to-day operations reached critical levels. Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> fell below the 100 billion euros mark for the first time since September 2011 on Thursday and stood at 95 billion euros on Friday.  The amount will fall further once the LTRO repayments will be settled next week Wednesday.  Economists expect overnight bank-to-bank borrowing costs to move up once excess liquidity drops below a certain level, seen between 80 billion and 100 billion euros.  This is important to watch, because the ECB has identified an "unwarranted" tightening of short-term money markets as one of the scenarios that could prompt fresh policy action. On Friday, the ECB said 12 banks would repay 9.4 billion euros from the first LTRO on April 30, and two banks would pay back 0.179 billion from the second LTRO.
