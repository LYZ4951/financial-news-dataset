WASHINGTON, April 25 (Reuters) - The head of government-run mortgage financier Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> has warned the company's regulator that a U.S. Senate  bill on housing finance reform could undermine the stability of the mortgage market if it became law in its current form.

Freddie Mac CEO Donald Layton said in an April 16 letter to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which was obtained by Reuters, that lawmakers should take steps to make sure the company could fulfill its role supporting the mortgage market during any transition period to its eventual closure.
