WARSAW, April 25 (Reuters) - Polish banks will not have to increase their provisions for bad loans after a review of their assets this year, because they have been strictly supervised and their balance sheets are healthy, Poland's representative to the European Banking Authority said.

Polish regulator KNF began the review in April. It will last until July and will cover 15, mainly listed, banks that are important to the financial system in Poland. In the asset-quality review (AQR), the regulator checks to see if banks have properly booked provisions for bad loans. The watchdog may ask lenders to increase them, and - if they lack capital as a result - require that they increase capital. "We don't expect Polish banks to increase provisions as a result of AQR, because Polish banks are conservatively supervised," Andrzej Reich told Reuters in an interview cleared for publication on Friday. "Supervision with strong inspection - a thing that distinguishes us in the EU - resulted in Polish banks being in good condition and the image of the banking sector being correct," he said. KNF's strict rules have been credited with helping Polish banks avoid the pitfalls that other European lenders fell into during the global economic crisis in 2008. But Reich doubts other EU banks will be forced to increase provisions too much. "The level of provisions in EU banks is already rising, because it seems that some banks anticipate AQR and they want to be ready for it," he said. "They want to ensure that they will not be forced to increase provisions due to AQR." AQR is only the first of exercise planned for banks this year. After the review, European authorities will conduct stress tests to check how banks might react to economic shocks.
