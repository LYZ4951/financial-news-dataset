MEXICO CITY, April 25 (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank kept interest rates on hold at a record low on Friday, highlighting signs of improving growth and tame price pressures in Latin America's second economy.

The Banco de Mexico maintained its benchmark interest rate <MXCBIR=ECI> at 3.50 percent, as expected by analysts polled by Reuters. [ID:nL2N0ND0Q4] Policymakers said downside risks to growth remain, but the balance of risks to the economy has improved marginally.
