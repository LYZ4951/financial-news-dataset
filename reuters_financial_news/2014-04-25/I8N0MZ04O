MUMBAI, April 25 (Reuters) - All members of the Indian central bank's monetary policy technical advisory committee recommended that Governor Raghuram Rajan keep interest rates unchanged at its policy review on April 1, according to minutes out on Friday.

That was ultimately the decision taken by Rajan, as the Reserve Bank of India kept the policy repo rate <INREPO=ECI> at 8 percent this month because of easing consumer inflation. The decision was in line with market expectations. In India, the central bank governor decides on monetary policy, while the technical advisory committee serves as a advisory body.
