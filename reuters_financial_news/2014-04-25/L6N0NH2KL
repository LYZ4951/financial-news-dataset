ANKARA, April 25 (Reuters) - Turkey's Capital Markets Board dismissed three deputy chairmen and 11 other senior members on Friday in a move that one source linked to purges in other state institutions since the emergence of a high-level corruption scandal.

The board, which regulates and supervises securities markets in Turkey, said in a statement it had made the changes in line with "necessities within management". A source familiar with the matter said the reshuffle was part of a government backlash to a graft investigation involving former cabinet ministers which surfaced on Dec. 17. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has denounced the graft probe as a plot against his rule orchestrated by his former ally Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric who has many supporters among Turkey's police and judiciary.
