April 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on Cyprus's  Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Stable from Negative  and affirmed the IDR at 'B-'. The agency has also upgraded the Long-term local  currency IDR to 'B-' from 'CCC'.  Other ratings have been affirmed with Short-term foreign-currency IDR at 'B' and  Country Ceiling at 'B'. The issue ratings on Cyprus's senior unsecured  foreign-law bonds have been affirmed at 'B-' and the issue ratings on unsecured  local-law bonds have been upgraded to 'B-' from 'CCC'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The revision of the Outlook and the upgrade reflect the following key rating  drivers and their relative weights:  High: Reform implementation under the EU-IMF programme continues to progress,  supporting policy coherence and credibility. In particular, wages and prices are  adjusting downwards in contrast to previous episodes of recession. Driven by  spending cuts in the public sector, compensation per employee fell 6% yoy in  2013. In the private sector compensation per employee fell by 5.3%. Fitch  expects the government to continue to adhere to programme parameters, following  parliamentary approval on privatisation plans despite initial resistance from  some political parties. Fiscal targets have been exceeded by a significant margin. The general  government deficit to GDP (GGD) ratio was contained at 5.4% in 2013, below the  projected 7.8% under the second Troika review of the programme and Fitch's  previous forecast of 6.7%. The outcome reflects a large fiscal correction and a  less severe-than-expected recession. Tight expenditure control contributed  significantly to the favourable outcome. Fitch has revised its fiscal deficit  projections to 5% of GDP in 2014 and 4.6% in 2015, from 7.5% and 6.9%,  previously.  The economy has proven to be more resilient than previously expected. GDP  contracted 5.4% in 2013, compared with the forecast 7.7% contraction under the  second Troika review and Fitch's previous forecast of 7% decline. Tourism and  professional services (excluding banking) have shown some resilience. Households  have also been using their savings to smooth their consumption. Fitch has  revised its GDP projections for 2014 to a contraction of 3.9%, from a 5.1%  decline previously.The risk of a repeat of Cyprus restructuring its domestic law bonds, which  occurred in 2013, has reduced, resulting in the Long-term domestic and foreign  currency IDRs being equalised. This equalisation is supported by the improved  fiscal and economic performance relative to Fitch's previous expectations,  leading to stronger financing buffers within the programme.   Medium: Cyprus's external debt position has improved compared with Fitch's previous  forecast, in part due to favourable revisions to previous official data. The  improvement also reflects positive trends in capital flows, including a  significantly narrower current account deficit.Cyprus's 'B-' Long term foreign currency and local currency IDR ratings also  reflect the following key rating drivers: There are still significant risks to creditworthiness posed by Cyprus's  continued deep economic and financial adjustment, which is still in its early  stages.  The restructuring of the banking sector has also undermined the potential growth  of the economy and unemployment will remain elevated in the near term. The stock  of NPLs (as per Central Bank of Cyprus's new definition) on average reached 42%  of gross loans at end-December 2013, and in some banks, was above 50%. The  quality of assets may deteriorate further in the next quarters, albeit  potentially at a slower pace. Banks have taken steps to enhance their internal  arrears and restructuring processes and now face the challenge of limiting any  additional credit deterioration and recovering NPLs without affecting their  recently restored capital positions. Public debt, at around 112% of GDP in 2013, was almost three times higher than  the 'B' median of 42% and has yet to peak. There is little further fiscal scope  to absorb any additional domestic or external shocks.  Risks to programme implementation have eased on recent performance but remain  elevated. Medium-term fiscal targets, in particular, are ambitious. Official  projections show a 3.3pp improvement in general government primary balance in  2016 to a surplus of 1.2% of GDP which could prove difficult to achieve.  A  significant portion of the consolidation also remains outside the programme  period which ends in 1Q16. Cyprus's financing requirements rise significantly after the end of the  programme period, which could be challenging for the government. According to  projections by the IMF gross financing needs, including for buffers, will rise  to EUR3.6bn in 2017 from EUR1.7bn in 2016, with maturing medium- to long- term  debt increasing to EUR2.7bn from EUR0.6bn. This includes the EUR1.8bn domestic  law bond held by Bank of Cyprus, which can be rolled over annually until 2017. The process of lifting capital controls carries risks, and a premature exit  could trigger material capital flight with negative economic consequences.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  - Significant slippage from programme targets, in particular fiscal deficits, or  adverse changes to public debt dynamics, for example, caused by a  deeper-than-expected recession or political shocks - A recession that is materially deeper or longer than assumed by Fitch which  would have adverse consequences for public debt dynamics  - Re-intensification of the banking crisis in Cyprus, for example, capital  flight from banks if capital controls are lifted prematurely   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  - A longer track record of successful implementation of the EU-IMF programme - Signs of a stabilisation in economic output and the banking sector - Improvements in export performance that help facilitate the rebalancing of the  economy - Lifting of capital controls with no material negative economic consequences. A  removal of capital controls would also lead to an upgrade of the Country  Ceiling.   KEY ASSUMPTIONS  Fitch expects the recession to be deeper and the downturn to last longer than  assumed under the EU/IMF programme. The agency expects output to contract by  around 3.9% in 2015 and 1% in 2016 and not return to growth until 2017. This  compares with the Troika programme forecast for the economy to grow from 2015.  Fitch assumes moderate slippage from Troika fiscal targets in the medium term,  especially in 2016 when the primary balance is expected under the programme to  improve significantly. The official programme targets a primary balance surplus  of 4% of GDP by 2018 from a deficit of 2% in 2013. It is likely that the fiscal  adjustment will need to be greater to achieve the ambitious long- term targets  for the primary balance, especially as downside risks to growth remain high.  Fitch's debt dynamics projections assume the government concludes the asset swap  of a portion of the outstanding government debt held by Cyprus Central Bank  (EUR1bn), generates proceeds from privatisation (of at least EUR1bn within the  programme period and EUR0.4bn outside) and dividends from the central bank  (EUR0.4bn).  Public debt has improved slightly from the previous rating review. Fitch expects  gross general government debt (GGGD) to peak at 126% of GDP in 2016 (compared  with over 131% in the previous review) and to gradually decline to 117% by 2020.  The improvement is due to better growth projections and smaller fiscal deficit  forecasts in the near term. Fitch currently assumes that the fiscal costs of bank recapitalisation will not  exceed the EUR2.5bn specified under the Troika programme, which includes a  contingency buffer of EUR1bn.  Fitch assumes that there will be no material escalation in developments between  Russia and Ukraine that would lead to a significant external shock to the  Cypriot economy. Tourism from Russia has been rising and Russians account for a  sizeable share of foreign deposits in banks. Our projections also do not include  the impact on growth of potential future gas reserves off the southern shores of  Cyprus, the benefits from which are several years into the future, although now  less speculative. A second test drill is planned for autumn. Similarly while  talks to resolve the Cyprus issue has resumed after a two-year break we do not  expect a solution any time soon.   Fitch assumes Cyprus and the euro zone as a whole will avoid long-lasting  deflation, such as that experienced by Japan from the 1990s. However, given the  nominal adjustment underway in Cyprus, downward price pressures will be  significant over the medium term. This will hinder the balance-sheet adjustment  of the public and private sectors. Fitch assumes the gradual progress in deepening fiscal and financial integration  at the euro zone level will continue; key macroeconomic imbalances within the  currency union will be slowly unwound; and euro zone governments will tighten  fiscal policy over the medium term. It also assumes that the risk of  fragmentation of the euro zone remains low.
