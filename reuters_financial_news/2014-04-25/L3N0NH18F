SINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - Singapore's CapitaLand Ltd <CATL.SI>, Southeast Asia's largest property developer, said on Friday its first-quarter profit dropped 1.7 percent, as lacklustre sales from its Singapore unit weighed on the company's income.

CapitaLand reported a profit after tax and minority interest of S$182.8 million ($145.26 million) for the quarter ended March 31. The company's revenue fell 3.4 percent to S$612.6 million, on a lower contribution from its Singapore operation, the company said in a statement. [ID:nSNZ65HQ4l] CapitaLand, in which Singapore's state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] owns a 41 percent stake, sourced 35 percent of its revenue from Singapore and 27 percent from China in 2013.
