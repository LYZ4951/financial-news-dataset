April 25 (Reuters) - LifePoint Hospitals Inc <LPNT.O> reported quarterly results in line with expectations but the company's positive comments on health insurance exchange enrollments drove up shares of the hospital operator and several of its peers.

The company's shares rose as much as 7 percent in early trade, while HCA Holdings Inc <HCA.N>, the largest U.S. hospital operator, rose nearly 6 percent. LifePoint, the first of the hospital operators to report this quarter, was offering some of the first commentary on the effects of the launch of private insurance marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform. "Medicaid expansion and insurance exchange enrollment are each yielding participation rates at the high end of our reform estimates," Chief Executive William Carpenter said. "In the seven states where we operate that have expanded coverage, we saw increasing Medicaid and decreasing self-pay volumes," he added. The Obama Administration said on April 1 that enrollment for the healthcare plan had exceeded its 7 million target by the end of March. [ID:nL1N0MT0UC] "It's pretty clear to us that this was a decent quarter in a really poor environment, that expectations certainly were low enough and that Medicaid engagement and reform comments were nicely positive," CRT Capital analyst Sheryl Skolnick said in a note to clients. Income from continuing operations attributable to LifePoint stockholders increased 14.9 percent to $37.1 million, or 78 cents per share, for the first quarter ended March 31. Excluding the reversal of a previously established federal tax valuation allowance, the company earned 65 cents per share, in line with the average analyst expectation, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue from continuing operations was up 8.2 percent to $1.01 billion, slightly ahead of analysts estimates of $1.00 billion. [ID:nBw6lL1ZHa] Lifepoint shares were up 5.43 percent at $56.42 in late afternoon trade, while HCA Holdings Inc shares were up 5.75 percent at $53.44.
