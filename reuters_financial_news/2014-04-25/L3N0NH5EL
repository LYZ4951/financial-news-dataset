April 25 (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's Corp <MCO.N> reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by higher income from its analytics unit.

Net income attributable to Moody's rose to $218 million, or $1 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $188.4 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier. [ID:nBw8DGwn5a] On an operating basis, the company earned 97 cents per share, above analysts' average estimate of 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 5 percent to $767.2 million but fell short of the average analyst estimate of $770.2 million. Revenue at Moody's analytics division, which sells financial research and data for assessing risk, rose 15 percent to $241.4 million, helped in part by the company's acquisition of Amba Investment Services. The analytics department has helped Moody's weather a slowdown in bond issuance. Bond rating still forms the bulk of Moody's revenue and that unit's revenue rose less than 1 percent to $525.8 million. The global bond markets, which hit record highs last year due to historic low interest rates, were muted during the first two months of the year. Moody's along with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings, owned by Fimalac SA's <LBCP.PA>, have a 95 percent share of the credit rating market. McGraw Hill Financial Inc <MHFI.N>, which owns Standard & Poor's, reports results next week. Moody's reaffirmed its full-year forecast for earnings of $3.90 to $4.00 per share and revenue growth percentage in high-single digits.
