FRANKFURT, April 25 (Reuters) - Austrian packaging group Constantia Flexibles may try again for a public listing, its chief executive said, after abandoning an attempt to list in Frankfurt last year. [ID:nL5N0JB3BX]

"Postponed does not mean cancelled," Thomas Unger said in an interview on Friday. "In the second half we will think about whether we will start preparing again for an IPO." Constantia Flexibles makes aluminium-foil, paper and plastic-film packaging and labels for the food, pharmaceutical and beverage industries.  It is number two in the European flexible-packaging market behind Australia's Amcor <AMC.AX> and is majority-owned by JP Morgan's One Equity Partners, with the rest belonging to the founding family's foundation. Global initial public offerings (IPOs) almost doubled in value in the first quarter of 2014 with Europe leading the way thanks to a nascent economic recovery that lifted investors' confidence and stock markets. [ID:nL5N0MP37F] Germany, however, has so far seen little activity this year. Only 3D printer maker SLM Solutions and automotive supplier Stabilus have until now officially announced flotations. [ID:nL6N0MZ1JO] [ID:nL6N0NH2Z1] Unger said Constantia Flexibles' timing last year may have been wrong. "We may have been too early," he said.  One Equity Partners received tentative bids for Constantia Flexibles last year from private equity groups including CVC [CVC.UL], Blackstone <BX.N> and EQT, and Unger said a sale was still conceivable although there were no current talks. Constantia Flexibles' revenues rose 29 percent in 2013 to 1.69 billion euros ($2.34 billion) thanks to acquisitions. Without these, they would have risen 4 percent.
