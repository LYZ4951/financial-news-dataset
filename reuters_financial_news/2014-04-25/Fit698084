April 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Government deficit and debt figures for 2013 illustrate  both the magnitude of fiscal consolidation undertaken in the eurozone and the  challenge eurozone sovereigns still face in stabilising and reducing public debt  ratios, Fitch Ratings says.  Figures released by Eurostat on Wednesday showed that the aggregate government  deficit to GDP ratio in the eurozone fell to 3.0% in 2013 from 3.7% in 2012, and  close to our forecast of 3.1%. The aggregate deficit has more than halved from  6.2% of GDP since 2010.  The consolidation is broad. The deficits of 11 of the 16 eurozone member states  with headline deficits in 2013 fell compared with a year earlier. Two were  unchanged (including Italy, at 3% of GDP). Bank recapitalisation costs in Greece  and Slovenia contributed to widening deficits - Slovenia's deficit rose to 14.7%  from 4%, due to one-off bank recapitalisation costs. Germany was close to  balance. However, budget deficits are still large. The aggregate deficit excluding  Germany was 4.3% of GDP in 2013, and deficits in France, Portugal, Cyprus,  Spain, and Ireland were between 4.3% and 7.2%. So although the aggregate deficit  has fallen to the 3% of GDP maximum under the Stability and Growth Pact, seven  eurozone member states have deficits above this.  Narrowing budget deficits, particularly structural deficits in the periphery,  are one aspect of more generally improving credit fundamentals among eurozone  sovereigns. The continued decline in government deficits is consistent with our  projection that the public debt/GDP ratio for the eurozone as a whole will peak  this year. Nevertheless, the government debt/GDP ratio remains high, rising to  92.6% at end-2013 from 90.7% at end-2012, according to Eurostat, and up from 66%  in 2007.  Debt/GDP is significantly higher than the aggregate level in the countries hit  hardest by the global financial and eurozone sovereign debt crises, and is still  rising in many countries. Eurozone public sector debt burdens will probably  require several more years of austerity to stabilise and start to fall due to  the weak medium-term growth outlook for the region. Moreover, high public debt  leaves sovereigns poorly placed to absorb further economic or financial shocks,  and reduces policy and financing flexibility.
