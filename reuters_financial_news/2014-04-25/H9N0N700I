BEIJING, April 25 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares fell on Friday as concerns about the state of China's economy and the health of its banking sector clouded positive earnings from several Chinese firms.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 1.5 percent. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 1.4 percent.  On the week, the HSI shed 2.4 percent, its biggest weekly fall since the week ended March 14. It is down 4.1 percent so far this year. Bank of China's Hong Kong listed shares <3988.HK> fell 1.5 percent despite the fourth-largest lender posting a higher than expected rise in its first-quarter net profit, as investors remained unconvinced about the overall health of the sector.[ID:L3N0NG2WS]
