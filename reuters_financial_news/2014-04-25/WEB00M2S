STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Reuters) - Entertainment broadcasting group MTG <MTGb.ST> posted lower than expected results for the first quarter on Friday and said it was carefully monitoring the effects of the geopolitical situation in Ukraine.

MTG's quarterly operating profit excluding associated companies and non-recurring items totalled 118 million Swedish crowns ($17.94 million), lagging a mean forecast of 144 million in a Reuters poll. Quarterly sales rose to 3.6 billion crowns from 3.2 billion a year earlier, compared to the market's expectation of 3.7 billion.
