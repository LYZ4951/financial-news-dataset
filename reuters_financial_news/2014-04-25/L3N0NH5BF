April 25 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings raised Spain's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings to "BBB+" from "BBB", saying the country's financing conditions had improved and economic outlook was less uncertain.

The ratings agency said Spain's fiscal track record over the past two years had been strong and the risk of Spanish banks further burdening the government had diminished.
