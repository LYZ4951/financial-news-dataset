MOSCOW, April 25 (Reuters) - Russia's 50 basis point rise in interest rates earlier on Friday will increase the risk of recession more than it will lower inflation, Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.

The central bank surprised markets by hiking the key one-week minimum auction repo rate to 7.5 percent due to increased inflation risks.
