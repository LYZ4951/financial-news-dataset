LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - WPP <WPP.L>, the world's largest advertising group, reported  first quarter like-for-like revenue growth of 7 percent, much better than expected, and said it had seen a surge in new business wins due to changes in the industry.

Martin Sorrell's group, which shocked the market in February when it lowered its 2014 profit guidance due to fierce competition, said its revenues had been held back at the reported level due to an 8.1 percent drag from the strong pound.
