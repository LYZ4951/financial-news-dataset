SYDNEY, March 3 (Reuters) - Australia's Transpacific Industries Group Ltd <TPI.AX> said on Monday it had agreed to sell its New Zealand waste management business to the Beijing Municipal Government's Beijing Capital Group for NZ$950 million ($798 million).

A source told Reuters last week that Beijing Capital was up against three other bidders for the New Zealand business, including private equity giant Carlyle Group <CG.O>, a consortium involving investment manager Morrison & Co, two Maori tribes and infrastructure investor Infratil Ltd <IFT.NZ>, and another unnamed bidder.
