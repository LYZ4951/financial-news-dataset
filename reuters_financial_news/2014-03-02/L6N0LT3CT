FRANKFURT, March 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to become the euro zone's single bank supervisor from November.

Before then, it wants to complete several checks on the banks it will watch over directly, appoint a supervisory board for the new institution and hire at least 1,000 staff. The main part is the so-called comprehensive assessment, which includes a backward-looking asset quality review and a forward-looking stress test of banks' balance sheets. All the results will be condensed and published in October.  Here is a preliminary overview of what will happen in the next few months, based on documents from supervisors seen by Reuters: (For a story on the new bank watchdog please click on: [ID:nL6N0LV441])  MID-FEBRUARY  Asset Quality Review (AQR): Selection of most risky portfolios for inclusion in the AQR on a bank-by-bank basis, selected portfolios must account for at least 50 percent of a bank's risk-weighted assets  END-FEBRUARY Stress test: European Banking Authority (EBA) to decide on draft for stress test methodology and data sheets, consultation with banks follows  MARCH  AQR: Actual review of the assets, collateral and provisioning in the selected portfolios and level-3 fair-value assets, or hard-to-value assets, will start in March.
