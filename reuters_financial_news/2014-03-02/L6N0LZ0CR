LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> is working on a plan to salvage its troubled Irish business, Ulster Bank, by merging it with a number of rivals, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.

Attempts to find a buyer for the business have failed and a team inside RBS is looking at tie-ups between Ulster and other lenders, such as Permanent TSB or the Irish subsidiaries of Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> or KBC, the newspaper reported. Bolting the institutions together could allow the new Ulster Bank to strip out costs and mount a credible challenge to Ireland's top players, it said. Ireland's finance minister Michael Noonan said on Saturday he would like a "significant" new bank with a big balance sheet to enter its lending market this year to drive competition in the diminished sector. [ID:nL6N0LY0FK] Ulster Bank has racked up losses of 2.5 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) over the past two years. It accounts for less than 4 percent of RBS's assets but was responsible for 20 percent of its bad debt charges last year. The Sunday Times said RBS is in talks with a handful of private equity firms about providing tens of millions of pounds in backing for the venture.  RBS declined to comment.
