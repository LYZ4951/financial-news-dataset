HONG KONG, June 18 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished a choppy session little changed on Wednesday, with turnover staying low as global markets brace for results from the U.S. Federal Reserve policymaking meeting.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.1 percent at 23,181.72 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong lost 0.2 percent. Soft China housing data released in the morning hurt developers listed in Hong Kong. China Overseas Land & Investment <0688.HK> and China Resources Land <1109.HK> shed 0.3 and 1.2 percent, respectively. China's average new home prices edged down for the first time in two years in May, official data showed, underlining a downtrend taking hold in the market as the economy slows. [ID:nL4N0OZ0JB] Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group <1929.HK> jumped 5.8 percent  to close at its highest since April 10 after posting solid results late on Tuesday. The company said on Wednesday it has agreed to buy U.S.-based diamond jeweller Hearts on Fire Co for $150 million in a move to extend its high-end product range. [ID:nL4N0OZ08J]
