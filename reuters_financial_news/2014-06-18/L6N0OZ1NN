MOSCOW, June 18 (Reuters) - The Russian central bank expects consumer price inflation to peak at between 7.7 percent and 7.9 percent in June before slowing to 6.8-7.0 percent by September, according to a policy document published on Wednesday.

The inflation rate is significantly higher than the central bank's target of a 5 percent rise in consumer prices, with the increase spurred by a weaker rouble and an asset selloff on emerging markets earlier this year.
