MILAN, June 18 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Etruria <PEL.MI> lost as much as 13 percent on Wednesday after larger rival Popolare di Vicenza said it was breaking talks about a planned takeover of the Tuscan bank.

The board of Banca Etruria failed to give a preliminary positive assessment on a binding offer Popolare Vicenza submitted at the end of last month, a condition the suitor had said was necessary for the offer to be valid. Popolare Vicenza said on Tuesday conditions were no longer in place to continue negotiating as it would not consider amending its proposal.
