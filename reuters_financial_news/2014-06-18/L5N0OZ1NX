ROME, June 18 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest utility Enel <ENEI.MI> aims to sell assets in Eastern Europe to meet its debt reduction target, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday.

"There has been interest for the East European assets," the source said. Enel declined to comment. Enel, Europe's most indebted utility, has pledged to sell assets worth around 4.4 billion euros ($6 billion) this year to help cut its debt pile.
