HANOI, June 18 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.07 percent at Wednesday's break, boosted by buying into Vietcombank <VCB.HM> shares on their ex-dividend date.

Shares of the lender, Vietnam's largest listed bank by market value, began trading on Wednesday without the right to get dividend, making the stock cheaper and thus more appealing to investors, said manager Nguyen The Minh of Viet Capital Securities.  VCB shares rose 4.87 percent to 26,100 dong ($1.23) each by midday.  Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).  VN Index  572.65   PREV.
