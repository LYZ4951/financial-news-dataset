NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Argentina and for hedge funds that refused to take part in its debt restructuring after its catastrophic 2001-02 default are scheduled to appear in federal court in New York on Wednesday afternoon, two days after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the country's appeal, a court official said.
