MUMBAI, June 18 (Reuters) - The Indian rupee fell on Wednesday as the worsening crisis in Iraq threatened to disrupt oil supplies but recovered from session lows after state-owned banks sold dollars, likely on behalf of the central bank.

The rupee <INR=D2> had revisited the near 2-month low of 60.55 per dollar earlier in the session, and retreated after the central bank sold the greenback via state-run banks starting around 60.53 rupee levels, traders said.   The Reserve Bank of India has been spotted intervening to check the rupee's falls in the past few sessions. On Tuesday, central bank governor Raghuram Rajan assured markets that India is watching the situation in Iraq, but despite the uncertainty the domestic economy is better prepared to deal with any shocks on the external front.

The greenback's strength offset the impact from exporter dollar sales in the domestic market.  The dollar held its gains on Wednesday after a broad firming on the back of higher-than-expected U.S. consumer prices for May that fanned speculation the Fed may inch closer towards hiking interest rates.

The partially convertible rupee <INR=D2> ended at 60.39/40 per dollar versus its previous close of 60.03/04. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported the Indian government expects oil prices to rise as high as $120 per barrel for several months due to the conflict in Iraq, potentially driving a hole of at least 200 billion rupees ($3.3 billion) in the budget, two government sources said.
