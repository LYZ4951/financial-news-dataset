FRANKFURT, June 18 (Reuters) - French lender Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> is interested in buying German online broker DAB Bank <DRNG.DE>, which is being sold by parent HVB, Germany's Manager Magazin reported, citing industry sources.

The deal could go through by August, the business magazine said. HVB, owned by Italy's UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, said in May it was considering a sale of DAB Bank because it was regarded as non-strategic following a revamp of HVB's retail business. [ID:nWEB00N4G] An HVB spokeswoman said on Wednesday that she would not comment on market rumours. "We continually review our stake holdings and strategic options, including possible acquisitions and sales," she said.
