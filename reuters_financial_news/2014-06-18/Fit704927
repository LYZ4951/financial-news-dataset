June 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based plastic packaging producer PT Berlina Tbk's <BRNA.JK> National Long-Term Rating at 'A-(idn)' with Stable Outlook.  'A' National Ratings denote expectations of low default risk relative to other  issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in circumstances or  economic conditions may affect the capacity for timely repayment to a greater  degree than is the case for financial commitments denoted by a higher rated  category.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Temporary increase in leverage: Leverage as expressed by net debt/EBITDA  increased to 2.6x in 2013, above the negative trigger guideline of 2.0x, mainly  caused by rising costs and intensive capex. The rising costs are due to an  increase in minimum wage, a hike in the electricity tariff and higher raw  material costs from the rupiah's depreciation. Meanwhile, capex was quite high  as the company expanded its capacity, acquiring  PT Quantex (auto oil bottling  manufacturer) and establishing  PT Natura Plastindo (a plastic processing  company). Nonetheless, we forecast leverage to moderate as margins improve,  while expanded capacity  and new businesses generate higher cash flows. Established relationship with Unilever: Berlina has established a long-term  relationship with its key customers, such as Unilever. The relationship with  Unilever has spanned over 40 years with Berlina as a key supplier for plastic  packaging. The Unilever group (Unilever NV <UNc.AS>/Unilever PLC <ULVR.L>, both 'A+'/Stable),  contributed to 69% and 51% of Berlina's total sales in 2013 and 1Q14  respectively. Berlina's reliance on the Unilever group is a positive point,  considering its creditworthiness and its dominant position in Indonesia's  growing fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. Cost pass through mechanism: Berlina has a long-term agreement with its  customers on a  cost-pass through pricing scheme. This helps the company to  mitigate foreign exchange   and  raw material price risks, and to maintain a  relatively stable long-term margin.  Manageable execution risk: Execution risk with regards to expansion is mitigated  through management's conservative expansion initiatives. Investment in  additional capacity is normally made after securing at least half of the sales  contracts. Furthermore, the company has some flexibility to scale back or delay  its capex in case demand slows. Small operating scale: Berlina's rating is constrained by its smaller business  scale, compared with higher-rated manufacturing peers. Small-scale operators are  often constrained by limited financial flexibility in terms of funding.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating include: - weakening of net debt/EBITDA at above 2x on a sustained basis
