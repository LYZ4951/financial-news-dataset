MOSCOW, June 18 (Reuters) - Russia will reduce the size of deposit payments required for Mastercard <MA.N> and Visa <V.N> to operate in the country, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on Wednesday.

New rules imposed on foreign card companies following Western sanctions over Ukraine required the payment operators to pay a hefty security deposit to the central bank. [ID:nL5N0OY38F]
