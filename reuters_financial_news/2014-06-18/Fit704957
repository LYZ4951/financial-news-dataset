June 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlooks on Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd (Eskom) and Transnet SOC Ltd [TRAN.UL] (Transnet) to Negative from Stable and affirmed their Long-term local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR). A full list of rating actions is below.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating actions follow the revision of the Outlook on South Africa's  Long-term IDRs to Negative from Stable (see 'Fitch Revises South Africa's  Outlook to Negative; Affirms at 'BBB'; dated 13 June 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com). Eskom ratings remain linked to those of the South African sovereign, based on  Fitch's assessment of its legal, operational and strategic ties with the state  as strong in accordance with the agency's 'Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage'  criteria. Transnet's 'BBB' IDRs reflect our view of its stand-alone profile as 'BBB-'.   The single-notch uplift to 'BBB' reflects the strong strategic and operational  links between Transnet and its parent, the sovereign. The Outlook on the foreign  currency IDR is now constrained to Negative by the sovereign rating Outlook as  we do not typically rate state owned corporates above the sovereign rating.   The rating actions are as follows: Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd  Long-term local currency IDR: affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook revised to Negative  from Stable Senior unsecured local currency rating: affirmed at 'BBB+'  National Long-term rating affirmed at 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-term rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)' Please see 'Fitch Affirms Eskom at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable' dated 2 August 2013  at www.fitchratings.com for Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities.  Transnet SOC Ltd  Long-term foreign currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook revised to Negative  from Stable Foreign currency senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'BBB' Short-term foreign currency IDR: affirmed at 'F3'  Long-term local currency IDR: affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable  Local currency senior unsecured rating: affirmed at 'BBB' Short-term local currency IDR: affirmed at 'F3'  National Long-term rating affirmed at 'AA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-term rating affirmed at 'F1+(zaf)'  National senior unsecured rating affirmed at 'AA(zaf)'  National senior unsecured rating for notes guaranteed by South African  government upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)'.
