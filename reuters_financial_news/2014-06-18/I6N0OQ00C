MILAN, June 18 (Reuters) - The initial public offering of Fineco, Italian bank UniCredit's <CRDI.MI> online broker, has already been fully covered three days into the share sale, according to a document by one of the banks involved in the operation.

"Books are oversubscribed on the full deal size including greenshoe," said the document, seen by Reuters. Fineco is listing a 30 percent stake in an IPO that could value the company at up to 2.668 billion euros ($3.6 billion). [nI6N0OM051] If the greenshoe option is fully exercised, a further 4.5 percent of Fineco will be floated, bringing the free float to 34.5 percent.
