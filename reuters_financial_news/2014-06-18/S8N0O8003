LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - Britain should deepen economic ties with China by increasing the use of offshore yuan and exploring connections with Chinese stock exchanges, Finance Minister George Osborne said on Wednesday.

"I want to see the links between our financial markets grow further. For example, Hong Kong and Shanghai are developing arrangements to connect their exchanges, I want London to be able to explore something similar," Osborne said.
