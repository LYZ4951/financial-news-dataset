PRAGUE, June 18 (Reuters) - Czech consumers and businesses are starting to make "normal" purchasing and investment decisions after a period of expectations of falling prices, central bank Governor Miroslav Singer wrote in a blog piece posted on the bank's website on Wednesday.

Singer wrote that following the bank's interventions to weaken the currency last November, the effect on retail sales growth was stronger than expected. He added future growth must be driven by higher incomes and better consumer sentiment. "Consumers and firms are beginning to behave 'normally' in consumer and investment decision-making - they are no longer counting on the possibility of a long-term decrease of prices of the things they intend to buy," Singer said.
