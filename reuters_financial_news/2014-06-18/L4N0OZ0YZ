SEOUL, June 18 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> ended slightly weaker against the dollar on Wednesday, easing for a fifth straight session as a high U.S. inflation number fuelled speculation the Federal Reserve might consider an earlier-than-expected rate hike.

However, exporters bought the won on dips for settlements to pare earlier losses. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,022.4 per dollar at the end of onshore trade, compared with Tuesday's close at 1,021.9. The won's five-day losing streak is its longest since mid-January. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.6 percent at 1,989.49 points, with domestic institutional investors offloading blue-chip names prior to the end of the Fed meeting later in the global day.
