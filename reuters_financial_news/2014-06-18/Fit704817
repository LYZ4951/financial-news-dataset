June 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Indonesia-based PT  Bank Nusantara Parahyangan Tbk <BNP.JK> (BNP) a National Long-Term Rating of 'AAA(idn)  and a National Short-Term rating of 'F1+(idn). The Outlook is Stable.  'AAA' National Ratings denote the highest rating assigned by Fitch on its  national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers or  obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other  issuers or obligations in the same country. 'F1' National Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely payment of  financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the same  country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the lowest  default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity profile  is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The ratings on BNP take into account Fitch's view of a high propensity of  support from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T> (MUFG)'s banking subsidiary, Bank of  Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd [MTFGTU.UL] (BTMU: 'A'/Stable), which is BNP's ultimate parent.  ACOM CO., Ltd <8572.T> (ACOM: 'A-'/Stable), BNP's 66.15% majority shareholder, is  40%-owned by the MUFG group. In addition, BTMU directly holds 9.35% of BNP  shares. In line with its criteria on rating financial institution subsidiaries  and holding companies, Fitch views BNP as strategically important to MUFG's  banking subsidiary through ACOM. Fitch also notes that BNP's presence in retail  and small-medium enterprise (SME) will supplement BTMU's wholesale business  growth in Indonesia. Parent company's support is premised on appointment of key personnel from BTMU  and ACOM, the transfer of product knowledge from ACOM, and technical assistance  in the form of risk management and credit policy from BTMU. Fitch expects  ACOM  and BTMU to provide funding support to BNP, in time of need. BNP has received  USD26m via a capital injection in 2013 from ACOM that has helped to support   BNP's capital position.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
