ZURICH, June 18 (Reuters) - VP Bank <VPB.S> said on Wednesday that net profit for the first half of this year would be "significantly lower" than the prior-year period, citing declining interest rates.

"The declining interest rate environment in the first half of 2014 is putting pressure on the valuation of interest rate hedging transactions," the Liechtenstein-based bank said in a statement.
