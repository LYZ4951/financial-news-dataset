June 18 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Kazakhstan-based  KazAgroFinance's (KAF) upcoming issue of KZT-denominated bonds an expected  Long-term local currency rating of 'BBB-(EXP)' and an expected National  Long-term rating of 'AA(kaz)(EXP)'. The planned issue amount is KZT17bn and the  tenor is 8.5 years. The final rating is contingent on the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already provided.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The bonds are rated at the same level as KAF's Long-term local currency Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-' and National Long-term Rating of 'AA(kaz)'. KAF's  IDRs and National Long-term Rating in turn reflect the likelihood of support it  may receive, if needed, from Kazakh authorities (through KazAgro National  Management Holding JSC, BBB/Stable). This is based on  the track record of  capital injections, the low cost of potential support, KAF's status as a  material subsidiary of KazAgro and the significant risks of reputational and  market access damage in case of KAF's default. The two-notch differential between KAF's 'BBB-' IDR and that of the Kazakh  sovereign's 'BBB+' reflects (i) KAF's less prominent policy role as a  development institution and lesser importance for the country's economy and  financial system relative to other government-owned institutions in Kazakhstan;  and (ii) the company's indirect government ownership, which may in some  scenarios impact the timeliness of support. KAF's vulnerable asset quality and  growth plans also mean that its leverage may over time increase significantly  from the current low level.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  KAF's ratings are likely to move in tandem with those of the sovereign and  KazAgro. Fitch may downgrade KAF's ratings if the agency believes that the government's  support propensity in respect to KAF has weakened; for example, if the company's  financial profile deteriorates considerably as a result of asset quality  worsening or increased leverage without support being provided.  KAF's ratings are as follows: Long-term foreign and local currency IDRs: 'BBB-', Outlook Stable  Short-term foreign currency IDR: 'F3' National Long-term rating: 'AA(kaz)', Outlook Stable  Support Rating: '2'
