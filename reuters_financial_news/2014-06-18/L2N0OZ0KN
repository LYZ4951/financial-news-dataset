GREG DAVIS, head of fixed income, Vanguard Group Inc

On asset class returns: "Investors have really come to terms with that if you're paying more in expenses, you're losing it on the return side. That's the one thing that's guaranteed. You have no idea what the return in any asset class is going to be, but you can guarantee that, whatever that return is, the expense ratio is coming out of it."  On investors trying to pick up incremental yield: "At some point, investors will look back and say: 'Why would I ever want to buy a Spanish 10 year government bond at a 2.5 percent yield?"  ALVARO MORALES, head of Santander's international private banking, in Geneva  On the promising market of newly arrived U.S. immigrants "What we are seeing is ... a lot of Mexican or Venezuelan clients who are sending their kids to U.S. universities, then their wives move (there), then (they) move for the weekends. And at the end they become U.S. tax residents."  FRANK PORCELLI, head of the United States Wealth Advisory Business, BlackRock  On the need for more transparency: "I think the industry needs to do a better job of explaining the outcome they're delivering through a product. I would like to see the industry move to ... actually understanding the outcome of these funds, and then presenting that info to your investors."  On announcing a new global macro fund: "We've been working on it for a while," Porcelli said. "I think this is a true global macro fund, and it will be a nice fit for advisers looking for uncorrelated returns and access to those markets."  On changes in the wealth advisory market: "There is a sizeable change in the U.S. advisory market. Advisers are moving from the traditional business model ... to advisory-based platforms where they charge one holistic wrap fee, and then they can put anything in that portfolio they want. They are positioning themselves as portfolio managers. They are blending active and passive."  JOE DURAN, chief executive officer and founding partner, United Capital  On recruiting fast-spending wirehouse advisers "I think the decision of whether you're going to be short-term greedy or long-term greedy makes a big difference. I believe the advisers at the wirehouses are short-term greedy. These people spend their money fast ... we believe that many of these advisers don't have the skill set to build real equity."  TOM BRADLEY, president, retail distribution, TD Ameritrade Holding  On Washington's focus on market structure issues: "I get concerned when folks dramatize the conversation around market structure and say things that flat out aren't true. I worry that they could scare the mass affluent away from equities, although it appears it hasn't."  TOM NALLY, president, TD Ameritrade Institutional  On finding the next generation of financial advisers:
