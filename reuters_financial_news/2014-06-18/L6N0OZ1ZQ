LAGOS, June 18 (Reuters) - The Nigerian currency was unchanged at 163.10 naira <NGN=D1> against the greenback at Wednesday's market close, supported by dollar sales by two local firms.

The naira had earlier eased to 163.65 against the U.S. dollar, dealers said, but recovered after local energy firm Transocean Oil sold $10.5 million and Fidelity Bank <FIDELIT.LG> sold an undisclosed number of dollars on the market. Dealers said demand for dollars was strong from bureau de change firms seeking hard currency for their clients.
