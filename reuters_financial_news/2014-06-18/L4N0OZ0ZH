TAIPEI, June 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan's financial regulators will allow Chinese firms to sell more yuan bonds from the second half of 2014, three sources said on Wednesday.

Chinese companies have issued a total of 8.7 billion yuan bonds in Taiwan so far, only 1.3 billion yuan short of the current limit of 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion). The sources did not say by how much the limit would be increased.
