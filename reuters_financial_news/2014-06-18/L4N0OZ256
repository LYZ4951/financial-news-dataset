BANGKOK, June 18 (Reuters) - The Thai index hit a two-week low on Wednesday, with investors dumping top telecoms shares after an auction of mobile licenses was suspended, while shares in the Philippines recouped most early losses ahead of a central bank meeting on interest rates.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> ended down 1.3 percent at 1,451.36, its lowest since June 4. Shares of top mobile phone firm Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> dropped 3.2 percent in brisk selling, including a number of large block deals.[ID:nSQB3sBJX5] [ID:nSQB5FcQlR][ID:nSQB4Vgrsb] Shares of AIS shareholder Shin Corporation <INTUCH.BK> and the country's third largest telecoms firm True Corporation <TRUE.BK> fell more than 2 percent each and were among the most actively traded. Thailand's telecommunications regulator on Tuesday temporarily suspended an auction of fourth-generation (4G) mobile licences saying more time is needed to work out the details of the process, and to ensure transparency. [ID:nL4N0OY26J] The Philppine main index <.PSI> ended nearly flat at 6,703.13, falling at one point to its lowest since April 29.
