LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Britain's anti-fraud agency said on Monday it has launched a criminal investigation into alleged rigging of the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.

"The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has today opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraudulent conduct in the foreign exchange market," the agency said in a statement. Around 15 authorities around the world are investigating allegations of collusion and price manipulation in the largely unregulated foreign exchange market.
