TOREZ, Ukraine, July 21 (Reuters) - The head of a Dutch forensic team said on Monday a train, carrying the remains of victims from the Malaysian airliner crash, should set off later on Monday to a place where "we can do our work".

"The train is going. We don't know the time and we don't know the destination. We got a promise: today it is going," he told reporters at the railway station in the eastern Ukrainian town of Torez.
