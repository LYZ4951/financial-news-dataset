July 21 (Reuters) - Banks are expected to repay 5.8 billion euros of the European Central Bank's crisis loans next week, only about a quarter of the 21.5 billion euros they will pay back this week, a Reuters poll found.

On Wednesday, the total amount outstanding on the more than 1 trillion euros of three-year loans banks took from the ECB in late 2011-early 2012 will be less than 400 billion euros for the first time, as the banks prepare for balance sheet stress tests conducted by the ECB. Through these tests, known as the Asset Quality Review, the ECB is assessing the ability of banks to withstand future crises. The results will be published in the second half of October. The poll of 24 euro zone money market traders also showed banks will borrow 100.5 billion euros from the ECB at its weekly refinancing tender, a little more than the 99.9 billion euros maturing from last week.
