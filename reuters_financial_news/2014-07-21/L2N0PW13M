July 21 (Reuters) - Investor William Ackman, who owns nearly 10 percent of Botox maker Allergan Inc <AGN.N>, said on Monday that the likelihood of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc <VRX.TO> succeeding in its hostile takeover for Allergan increased on Monday.

The spread on the deal - or the difference between the value of the two companies' shares and the ratio implied by the deal's terms - had narrowed, indicating that investors believed a deal was closer, Ackman said during an interview on CNBC.
