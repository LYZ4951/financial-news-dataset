July 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

A deeper examination of interest rate risk in structured  finance deals is key when analysing structures that try to hedge this risk with  interest-rate caps, note-rate caps or issuance of fixed rate notes, Fitch  Ratings says. These increasingly popular structural features protect deals where  the SPV pays a fixed or a capped rate on the notes in return for a floating  market interest rate on the portfolio from extremely high interest rates. But  they would not do so if rates rose more moderately from their current low levels  but did not exceed the cap/notes fixed rate.  Given the increased cost of traditional interest-rate swaps, many transaction  sponsors are looking at new ways to address interest-rate risk where portfolios  include fixed-rate loans in addition to floating rate receivables. So far RMBS  transactions with interest or note-rate caps have emerged in Italy and the  Netherlands, and we are receiving enquiries in other jurisdictions and for other  asset classes as well.  The overall portfolio can generate substantial excess spread by paying more  interest than is required to pay interest on the notes. This is possible when  the interest rate on the notes is capped and underlying loans pay an uncapped  floating rate of interest or have a fixed rate which resets periodically -  should interest rates rise beyond the point where the cap/fixed rate on the  notes is set, and stay there for a long time. Similarly, the issuer would  benefit from substantial cash flows in transactions with an interest rate cap  provided by a third party should the interest rate consistently exceed the  strike rate.  For transactions with these structural features, Fitch's standard rising  interest rate stresses, where rates rapidly increase to very high levels, can be  beneficial or less stressful than scenarios where rates rise from their current  very low levels close to the cap strike. Fitch will - in such cases - test  different "deal-specific" interest rate patterns, to analyse whether the notes  would still be able to pay interest and principal according to their terms,  without the benefit of the additional cash flows created by the cap. This is  consistent with our RMBS cash flow criteria and interest rate stresses criteria.  Tests could also include different amortisation speeds and default distributions  between the floating and the fixed rate sub-pools.  Alternative hedging structures may also provide for issuance of fixed as well as  floating-rate notes, typically in a proportion that mirrors the portfolio  interest rate composition. The effect of rising interest rates on these  transactions would be the same as for deals with interest-rate caps. However,  scenarios where rates stay at current market levels or decrease are usually the  most detrimental ones.
