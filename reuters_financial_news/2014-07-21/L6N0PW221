DUBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - Kuwait Finance House (KFH) <KFIN.KW>, the country's biggest Islamic lender, reported a 6.4 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Monday, slightly below analysts' estimates.

Net profit rose to 28.51 million dinars ($101 million) in the three months to June 30 from 26.8 million dinars in the same period a year ago, according to Reuters calculations.  That compared with the analysts' average forecast of 29.2 million dinars in a Reuters poll. [ID:nL6N0PV0BE] KFH didn't give a quarterly breakdown so Reuters calculated the figure based on financial statements. The firm's first-half net profit was 54.57 million dinars, up 10 pct year-on-year, it said in a statement.
