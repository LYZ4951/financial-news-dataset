BUDAPEST, July 21 (Reuters) - Hungary's MKB has built provisions worth 5.1 billion forints ($22.28 million) for the first half of 2014 to cover refunds to clients due to new legislation that requires banks to compensate borrowers for exchange rate spreads applied on foreign currency loans, the bank said on Monday.

MKB, a unit of Bayerische Landesbank<BLGG.gi.F>, also said in a statement that it was planning to use the option of legal remedy related to another part of the legislation which covers unilateral contract changes.
