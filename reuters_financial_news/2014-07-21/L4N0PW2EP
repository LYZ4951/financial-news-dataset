HONG KONG, July 21 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's newly-formed Competition Commission has named Stanley Wong as its first chief executive officer, the regulatory body said on Monday.

Wong, a Canadian lawyer, will become chief executive on Sept. 3, the commission said. Hong Kong introduced competition legislation in 2012 in a bid to curb anti-competitive behaviour across a range of sectors. The Competition Commission, which will enforce the new rules, is in the process of getting staffed and consulting on how the legislation will be implemented.
