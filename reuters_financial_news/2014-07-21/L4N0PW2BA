July 21 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Monday on expectations of better earnings after upbeat U.S. corporate results helped boost sentiment in the region, while Indonesian shares ended near a 14-month high close ahead of the outcome of the presidential election.

The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> closed 0.8 percent firmer, its highest close since May 30, 2013. The gains were led by shares of real estates companies and banks.  Foreign investors sold $1.97 million in shares. But analysts said most of the foreigners were on the buying side ahead of the election results as local investors are shifting to deposits, which give a return of about 11 percent. Analysts said the market sees Jakarta Governor Joko "Jokowi" Widodo, likely to be the next president, as a reform-minded candidate who would cut red tape, leading to better productivity and an improved business environment. The Elections Commission will announce the results of the vote on Tuesday. Thai shares <.SETI> also finished at their highest close in more than a year, helped by $17.49 million foreign inflows on expectations of a pickup in economic growth, strong earnings from banks, and hopes of a temporary constitution before end-July. Thailand's second-largest lender Krung Thai Bank Pcl <KTB.BK> reported a 15.7 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, falling short of forecasts despite increasing its loans business and non-interest income. Its shares fell 3 percent. [ID:nL4N0PQ1F7] Bank of Ayudhya <BAY.BK>, which reported a 14 percent gain in June quarter profit, rose 0.5 percent. [ID:nL4N0PR3JJ]   Vietnam <.VNI> gained 0.8 percent to a more than three-month high, while Singapore <.FTSTI> edged up 0.1 percent to its highest since May 30, 2013.  Malaysia <.KLSE>, which saw foreign outflows of $41.82 million on Monday, bucked the trend and fell 0.2 percent.
