KIEV, July 21 (Reuters) - Ukraine is willing to hand over coordination of an investigation into the Malaysian airliner crash to international partners but Kiev is convinced the plane was shot down by "professionals", Ukraine's prime minister said on Monday.

"Ukraine is ready to hand over a coordinating role in the investigation into the tragedy to our Western partners. And the Netherlands could head that process," Arseny Yatseniuk told a news conference.
