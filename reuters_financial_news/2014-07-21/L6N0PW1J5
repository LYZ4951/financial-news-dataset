DONETSK, Ukraine, July 21 (Reuters) - A separatist leader said Ukrainian government forces were trying to break into the rebel-held city of Donetsk on Monday and that fighting was under way near the east Ukrainian city's railway station.

Sergei Kavtaradze, an official of the rebels' self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said there were at least four tanks and armoured vehicles trying to break through into the city.
