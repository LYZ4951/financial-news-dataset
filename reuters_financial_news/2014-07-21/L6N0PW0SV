DUBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - Dubai's stock market looks set to remain volatile on Monday after a sharp drop in the last session, while a setback in reconciliation talks between Bahrain's government and the opposition could weigh on that bourse.

The Dubai index <.DFMGI> tumbled 6.0 percent on Sunday, wiping out most of last week's gains, after Aabar Investments, a key shareholder in construction firm Arabtec <ARTC.DU>, did not confirm a report which said Aabar planned to raise its stake. The sell-off spread from Arabtec, which plunged its daily 10 percent limit, to other Dubai stocks and also hit the market in Abu Dhabi, where the main index <.ADI> fell 2.4 percent. Arabtec, which is one of Dubai's most heavily traded stocks, said on Monday that its board would review its second-quarter financial results as well as "other reports and recommendations" on Thursday. But it did not elaborate, and it is not clear that retail investors are prepared to resume speculating about positive news from Arabtec. [ID:nL6N0PW0TE] Abu Dhabi's market, on the other hand, could receive some support from telecommunications operator Etisalat <ETEL.AD>, its biggest listed company, which on Sunday reported a 26 percent jump in second-quarter profit. Etisalat made a net profit of 2.5 billion dirhams ($681 million) in the three months to June 30, beating the 2.19 billion dirham average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters. [ID:nL6N0PV11C] Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD> also beat estimates and posted a 22.5 percent jump in second-quarter profit. The lender made 454.8 million dirhams ($123.8 million) in the quarter, against the average forecast of 406 million dirhams. [ID:nL6N0PV0ML] Meanwhile, Bahrain's bourse <.BAX> could come under pressure after the country's justice ministry asked a court to suspend the activities of the main Shi'ite Muslim opposition group, which could set back any efforts to restart reconciliation talks.
