HONG KONG, July 21 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares sagged on Monday, though the Macau gambling sector regained momentum following losses last week stemming from a corruption probe and disappointing earnings.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.3 percent at 23,387.14 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell for a fourth straight day, dropping 0.8 percent.  Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> and Sands China <1928.HK> were the standout winners on the Hang Seng, up 3.1 and 2.3 percent respectively.  But gains were not enough to offset losses in a few index heavyweights. Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> declined 1.1 percent and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <0386.HK> by 1.4 percent.
