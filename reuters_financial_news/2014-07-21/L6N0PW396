JERUSALEM, July 21 (Reuters) - Mobileye N.V., which makes software and cameras that help cars avoid accidents, said on Monday it has launched a road show for its U.S. initial public offering of around $500 million.

The Israeli based company will sell 27.75 million shares - 8.325 million by Mobileye itself and another 19.425 million by the selling shareholders. [ID:nPn98Smsl] Mobileye said it expects the IPO on the New York Stock Exchange to price at $17 to $19 a share and list under the symbol MBLY. That would bring in proceeds of $472 million to $527 million. The selling shareholders have also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up 4.16 million additional shares to cover any over-allotments. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are lead underwriters. The company's collision-avoidance technology is used in more than 3 million vehicles made by the likes of BMW <BMWG.DE> and General Motors <GM.N>. Mobileye's systems include a windshield-mounted camera that takes pictures of what is in front of the driver. The images are processed and, in real-time, a small device on the dashboard gives the driver audio-visual warnings. Amnon Shashua, the firm's chairman, and Ziv Aviram, its chief executive, each own 9 percent in the company. Mobileye's other top shareholders include Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N>, Fidelity Investments, BlackRock <BLK.N>, and Enterprise Holdings, the No 1 U.S. car rental company.
