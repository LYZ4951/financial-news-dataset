LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Investor demand to pull money out from hedge funds dropped to a six-month low in July, following portfolio adjustments during the previous month, data released on Monday showed.

The SS&C <SSNC.O> GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator, a monthly snapshot of hedge fund clients giving notice to withdraw their cash expressed as a percentage of assets under administration, fell to 3.15 percent in July from 4.8 percent in June and the lowest since January. "July's forward redemptions decreased by over 1 percent, but remain in line with historical averages," said Bill Stone, chairman and chief executive officer, SS&C Technologies. Exit requests typically declined at the start of every quarter, the data showed.
