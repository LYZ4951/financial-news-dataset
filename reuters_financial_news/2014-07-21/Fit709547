July 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Rothschild & Cie Banque's (RCB) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' with a Stable Outlook. Its other ratings were affirmed at Short-term IDR 'F1', Viability Rating (VR) 'a', Support Rating '5' and Support Rating Floor 'No Floor'.   KEY RATING DRIVERS -VR AND IDRS RCB's ratings are driven by its standalone credit profile, as reflected in the  VR, which is based on RCB's excellent advisory position in France, robust and  experienced management, low risk profile, strong profitability, lack of debt and  healthy capital ratios. The VR also factors in its modest size, fairly narrow  product offering and its business concentration in France. RCB remains a market leader in mid-cap M&A business in France, due to the strong  expertise of the bank's experienced executives, and its solid network of  contacts. The lack of conflict of interest is a key competitive advantage for  RCB and mitigates reputation and legal risks that often arise with larger  investment banks. Asset management (AM) is an important source of revenue  diversification for RCB.RCB has a very low risk appetite. The general partners' personal wealth can be  accessed to cover the bank's liabilities, which is a strong incentive to  maintain a low risk profile. Fitch also considers the involvement of unlimited  liability partners in the decision-making and oversight processes as being  aligned with the interests of creditors and therefore not a negative rating  driver. RCB's balance sheet is low-risk and highly liquid. The bank takes no proprietary  positions, and market risk is minimal. Well-controlled operational and  reputational risks are paramount given the importance of avoiding reputational  damage to the business model and the Rothschild name. RCB's profitability remained strong even during depressed business cycles. In  2013, the tough operating environment translated into declining merger and  acquisition business volume, which were compensated by increasing asset  management revenue. Operating return on average assets and equity ratios  remained high in 2013, a trend which Fitch expects to continue throughout 2014  given improved prospects for M&A activities. RCB's ability to adjust its cost  base to revenue to remain profitable and to generate solid cash flow is a  crucial factor for its ratings and will be closely monitored by Fitch. RCB has no financial debt (i.e. excluding deposits) and only minimal pay-out  requirements. In addition, the bank maintains a comfortable liquidity buffer.  RCB's capital base is sufficient, given its low risk profile, despite being low  in absolute terms.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VR AND IDRS Fitch views RCB's size and business concentration as constraints to upside  potential for its ratings. Conversely, any tarnishing of the Rothschild  reputation and loss of franchise would put negative pressure on RCB's ratings. In addition, lower revenue diversification, for example linked to material  outflows of assets under management, or failure to address shrinking revenue by  adjusting costs could have negative implications for the ratings. Moreover,  RCB's ratings would be sensitive to a lower rating of its sister bank (N M  Rothschild & Sons Limited [CONIAN.UL], BBB+/Stable), as this could weigh on RCB's capital  ratios.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING The bank's Support Rating reflects Fitch's view that any external support to  RCB, if needed, would be uncertain.  RCB is fully-controlled by Paris-Orleans (PO), a listed financial company  regulated by the French banking authority and 58%-controlled by the French and  English Rothschild family. RCB would look to PO or its shareholders for support  if needed. Fitch believes that it is the Rothschild family's priority to uphold  the reputation of all family companies and that resources would be made  available to support RCB, to the best of the family's ability, should the need  arise.
