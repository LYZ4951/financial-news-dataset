ZURICH, July 21 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Swiss private bank Julius Baer <BAER.VX> said on Monday it was quite likely the bank would reach a settlement before the end of this year in a U.S. criminal probe into the bank's role in helping wealthy Americans evade taxes.

Larger rival Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> reached a settlement in a similar case in May and Julius Baer Chief Executive Boris Collardi said this could help unlock negotiations for the other banks involved in a tax probe. "The probability is certainly quite high that this settlement will take place this year," Collardi said at a news conference after the publication of the bank's half-year results. Collardi also said Julius Baer has the resources to satisfy a possible U.S. fine, without going into specific figures.
