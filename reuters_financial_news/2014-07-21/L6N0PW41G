KIEV, July 21 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman suggested on Monday that pro-Russian rebels had tampered with the black box flight recorders retrieved from the Malaysian airliner brought down in east Ukraine.

He told a news conference that the rebels would give the flight recorders to international aviation authorities, but added that: "There is information that the recorders were in their hands all these days and they did certain things to them."
