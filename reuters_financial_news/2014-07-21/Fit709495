July 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Sri  Lanka-based Asian Alliance Insurance PLC's <AAIC.CM> (AAIP) Insurer Financial Strength  (IFS) Rating at 'B'. The agency has also affirmed the National Insurer Financial  Strength Rating and the National Long-Term Rating at 'BBB+(lka)', respectively.  The ratings are on Stable Outlook.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  AAIP's ratings reflect the synergistic benefits from its ultimate parent,  Softlogic Holdings Plc <SOFT.CM> (SHP; BBB+(lka)/Stable) based on its 47.2% effective  ownership. The ratings also reflect AAIP's modest but growing market share and  the pressure on its capitalisation from aggressive top line growth. AAIP has operational synergies with the group due to its presence in healthcare  and financial services. The company also has access to the group's branches and  retail outlets across the country. The company has 53 branches.  AAIP's regulatory solvency for the life segment at 31 March 2014 was 2.89x  (end-2013: 2.48x and end-2012: 1.88x). Non-life solvency deteriorated to 2.02x  (end-2013: 2.21x and end-2012: 2.37x) mainly due to premium growth. The  management has committed to maintain the life solvency above 2x and improve the  non-life solvency to 3x by end-2014. In 2013, gross written premium (GWP) in life grew 24%, supported by new  business, and the non-life GWP moderated to 31% after aggressive growth of 90%  in 2012. AAIP's investment portfolio remains heavily exposed to equity at 25.7%  of total invested assets. The non-life combined ratio was very high at 129% and  compares with an industry average of 105%. Management intends to improve this  ratio through a more disciplined approach to pricing and by concentrating on  profitable business lines. Fitch expects any improvement to the combined ratio  to be slow given the intense price competition in the non-life business.  Established in 1999, AAIP is a composite (life and non-life) insurer accounting  for less than 3% of industry assets at end-2013. In 2011, the company became a  part of SHP, a diversified conglomerate. In early 2013, strategic investors,  Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft and  Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. bought 38% of AAIP from  Soft Logic Capital.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  The ratings may be downgraded if there is a sustained weakening in AAIP's  regulatory solvency ratios to below its management-committed internal thresholds  of above 2x for life and 3x for non-life. Any significant weakening in SHP's  credit profile will result in a downgrade.
