July 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed PT Tugu Reasuransi Indonesia's (Tugu Re) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating at 'A(idn)' with Stable Outlook. 'A' National IFS Ratings denote a strong capacity to meet policyholder  obligations relative to all other obligations or issuers in the same country,  across all industries and obligation types. However, changes in circumstances or  economic conditions may affect the capacity for payment of policyholder  obligations to a greater degree than for financial commitments denoted by a  higher rated category.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects Tugu Re's healthy operating performance underpinned by  strong premium growth, sound investment return and the absence of major  catastrophe events in Indonesia in 2013. The company's investment portfolio has  remained liquid with cash equivalents and fixed income instruments forming the  bulk of its total invested assets. The rating continues to be constrained by the  company's weak capitalisation and high business concentration in Indonesia.  Tugu Re's combined ratio has consistently remained below 100% over the last five  years and slightly improved to 96.4% at end-2013 from 98.4% at end-2012 due to  manageable claims and stable operating expense management. The company's premium  growth has remained sound at an average of more than 20% per year, supported by  the growth of direct insurance premiums in Indonesia and regulations that  require direct insurers to obtain reinsurance support from domestic reinsurance  companies.  The company faces potential volatility in its underwriting business in view of  the concentration of risk exposure to catastrophe-prone Indonesia. Indonesian  risks represented almost 100% of Tugu Re's business at end-2013. Tugu Re can  mitigate its catastrophe exposure by careful management of its underwriting and  maintenance of a prudent retrocessionaires programme.  Tugu Re's capitalisation is considered weak relative to the company's business  operations. Its risk-based capitalisation (RBC) ratio amounted to 126.7% at  end-2013 (end-2012: 135.1%). The company plans to raise additional capital in  2014 and is making efforts to optimise its investment portfolio and enhance its  claim settlement period to improve its capitalisation. Tugu Re has targeted its  RBC ratio to be above 130% by the end of 2014. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Tugu Re will maintain  sufficient capital buffer to support its operations and business expansion.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
