RIO DE JANEIRO, July 21 (Reuters) - The crisis afflicting Portugal's Banco Espírito Santo SA <BES.LS> is unlikely to have an impact on the European banking system as a whole, Jose Manuel Durão Barroso, president of the European Commission, said on Monday.

"There's not a single concern in that sense," Barroso told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Rio de Janeiro, when asked about the woes at Portugal's biggest listed bank.
