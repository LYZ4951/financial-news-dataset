HONG KONG, July 21 (Reuters) - China shares made a tepid start to a week that will feature the opening of subscriptions for a new batch of initial public offerings (IPOs), sparking fears that sizable funds will be drawn away from existing stocks.

Eleven of the 12 IPOs which were approved last week will start taking subscriptions on Wednesday and Thursday. The new offerings are  lock up as much as one trillion yuan ($161.13 billion) in funds. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.2 percent at 2,054.48 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings inched up 0.1 percent. China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> shed 1.3 percent after it warned late on Friday of a sharp profit decline in January-June from a year earlier. Top index boost Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group <600887.SS> gained 4.6 percent to its highest since May 26. But its shares are still down 10.4 percent for the year, compared to CSI300's 7 percent fall.
