MUMBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose for a fifth consecutive session on Monday as Reliance Industries rallied after its quarterly earnings beat estimates, while merger-related news led to gains in some companies such Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Sentiment was also helped as overseas investors, who have supported a rally in Indian shares this year, were net buyers for a third consecutive session on Friday with purchases of 5.74 billion rupees ($95.22 million) despite concerns over escalating tensions between Russian and the West. Still, trading is likely to remain range-bound, according to dealers, with investors continuing to monitor earnings including those from Axis Bank Ltd <AXBK.NS> on Tuesday, and Ambuja Cements Ltd <ABUJ.NS> and ACC Ltd <ACC.NS> on Thursday. "Right now, the markets are completely driven by corporate earnings. There are no immediate triggers left. It's a time of consolidation and we will see stock-specific action in the near-term," said Daljeet S Kholi, head of research at IndiaNivesh. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose 0.29 percent to 25,715.17, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 0.26 percent higher at 7,684.20. Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> rose 2.14 percent after it posted stronger-than-expected earnings on Saturday, bolstered by strong revenue growth in its oil and gas business and higher margins in its core refining business. [ID:nL4N0PU0BZ] Merger-related news also boosted some shares. Kotak Mahindra Bank <KTKM.NS> rose 0.6 percent after it said on Sunday it would buy a 15 percent stake in Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) <MCEI.NS> for 4.59 billion rupees ($76.1 million). [ID:nI8N0PQ00D] MCX closed 7.87 percent higher, its highest since June 2013. Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS> rose 2.78 percent, gaining for a second consecutive session on speculation it would be merged into HDFC Bank Ltd <HDBK.NS>. The shares gained even as HDFC Bank Deputy Managing Director Paresh Sukthankaron told reporters the bank was not discussing a merger with HDFC as of now. [ID:nWNBS00JDS] HDFC <HDFC.NS> reported a 21 percent fall in April-June earnings from a year earlier, while HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> reported a 21 percent increase in June-quarter earnings. Shares of the lender were down 0.6 percent. [ID:nL4N0PW177] [ID:nWNBS00JEU] Consumer stocks also gained on defensive buying as investors were looking to cut risk in portfolios. ITC Ltd <ITC.NS> gained 1.7 percent while Hindustan Unilever Ltd <HLL.NS> ended 0.81 percent higher. Power companies were among the stocks which declined. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd <BHEL.NS> ended 1.5 percent lower, adding to its 1.9 percent fall on Friday, while Tata Power Co. Ltd <TTPW.NS> ended 1.9 percent lower, declining further from a 2.5 percent fall on Friday.
