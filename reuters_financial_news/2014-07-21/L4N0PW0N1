SEOUL, July 21 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> edged up on Monday as foreign investors sold dollars as worry about global geopolitical tensions appeared to ease, while stocks ended flat.

The local currency <KRW=KFTC> closed up 0.26 percent at 1,026.8 against the dollar versus Friday's close of 1,029.5. The won was at its strongest in five days. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> was quoted at 2,018.50 points at the end of Monday's session, down 0.05 percent from Friday's onshore close at 2,019.42. The KOSPI reached its year-to-date high of 2,030.61 before midday but reversed earlier gains as the session wore on in the absence of major cues.  Institutions sold a net 134 billion won ($130.53 million)  of KOSPI shares, selling for 15 consecutive sessions and edging out gains from foreign investors, who purchased a net 177 billion won ($172.41 million).
