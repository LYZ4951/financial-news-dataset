DUBAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Sunday that its programme for Pakistan was broadly on track.

The IMF's mission chief for Pakistan, Jeffrey Franks, also told a news conference in Dubai that he encouraged the central bank to be vigilant in coming months to guard against a rebound of inflation. Last September, the IMF agreed to lend Pakistan $6.7 billion over three years.
