WELLINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - New Zealand house price growth slowed in January and appeared  to be levelling out in the face of central bank lending restrictions and a looming rise in interest rates, the government property valuer said on Monday.

Quotable Value's (QV) residential property index rose 9.6 percent in the year to Jan. 31, compared with a 10 percent annual rate in December. The index is now 12.8 percent above the market's previous peak in late 2007. QV said limits on how much banks can lend on low deposit-high value house loans (LVR), imposed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) in October, appeared to be having an effect. "These speed limits have reduced the number of first home buyers active in the market, but perhaps more importantly have led to increased caution amongst buyers," said QV research director Jonno Ingerson. Auckland region prices were up 14.5 percent in the year to January from a 15.4 percent rate the month before, while Christchurch slowed to a 12 percent gain from 12.7 percent. Ingerson said the prospect of higher home loan rates as the RBNZ tightens policy, most likely from next month, may already be affecting confidence, and when they come will slow prices further.
