HONG KONG, May 29 (Reuters) - Dutch pension fund APG Asset Management will pay up to $650 million to take a 20 percent stake in Chinese warehouse firm e-Shang, also setting up a joint venture to expand in China, the companies said on Thursday.

E-shang, backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus [WP.UL], and APG aim to tap strong demand for warehouses as Chinese e-commerce booms. The joint venture plans to develop and run modern logistics real estate assets across China.
