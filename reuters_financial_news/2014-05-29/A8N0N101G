ATHENS, May 29 (Reuters) - Greece's fourth-largest lender by assets Alpha Bank <ACBr.AT> was loss-making in the first quarter as provisions for impaired loans weighed on its bottom line, offsetting a year-on-year  improvement in net interest income.

Alpha posted a loss of 94.1 million euros ($128 million), at the low end of market expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a loss of 107.6 million euros on average. The bank said loan-loss provisions fell 22 percent year-on-year to 395 million euros with non-performing credit rising to 33.3 percent of its loan book, from 32.7 percent in the last quarter of 2013.
