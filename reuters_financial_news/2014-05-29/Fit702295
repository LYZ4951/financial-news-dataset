May 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Afren plc's <AFRE.L> Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating  actions is at the end of this release. Afren continues to generate solid operating cash flows, which are sufficient to  finance its ambitious exploration and development programme. In the past the  company has demonstrated its ability to meet ambitious production targets as it  significantly boosted oil output in Nigeria in 2012 and 2013. Afren's  profitability is supported by the tax holiday in place at Ebok, its largest  producing field. However, Afren's production remains highly concentrated, which  gives rise to elevated geological, country and tax risk, and its scale of  operations is small. We view the possible oil industry reform in Nigeria as a  risk, as its timing and key parameters, including tax implications, are unclear.  These factors constrain Afren to the 'B' rating category. This could be improved  if Afren manages to substantially ramp-up production in the Kurdistan region of  Iraq, where it has vast reserves. Afren is a small-scale exploration and production (E&P) company with producing  assets in Nigeria and Kurdistan. In 2013 its net production reached 47 thousand  barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d), predominantly liquids, which  generated USD960m in EBITDA.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Operational Performance In 2013, Afren's net production (working interest including cost recovery)  averaged 47mboe/d, up 13% yoy and almost 2.5 times higher than in 2011, which  was reflected in our June 2013 upgrade to 'B+' from 'B'. This growth was mainly  attributable to Ebok, Afren's largest offshore field brought on stream in 2011.  In 2013, Afren also had a sound 2P reserve replacement rate (155%) and  maintained low lifting costs (below USD5/bbl). However, it had a relatively  small proved reserve life (nine years overall; six years in Nigeria), typical  for E&P companies of this size.   In 1Q14, Afren's net production went down to 35.5mboe/d as it recovered the  initial investments at Ebok and its working interest in the field decreased. We  expect Afren's 2014 net production to be within 35-40mboe/d, rebounding to  40-50mboe/d in 2015, mainly thanks to moderate output growth at Ebok and ramping  up of OML26 in Nigeria and Barda Rash in Kurdistan.  Concentrated Production Afren's production remains highly concentrated. In 1Q14, Ebok accounted for 73%  of Afren's total production, and only 1% of oil was produced outside of Nigeria.  Afren has significant 2P reserves in Kurdistan (114 million barrels, 40% of its  total) and is hoping to boost production at its Barda Rash field soon. However,  any significant progress there will only be possible if Afren gets access to a  secure export channel. We now assume that Nigeria is likely to dominate Afren's  output in the medium term. This concentration exposes Afren to elevated emerging  market country and tax risks.   Tax Holiday Benefits Cash Flows Oil companies are generally heavily taxed in Nigeria. They pay substantial  royalties and are subject to the Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT), which normally  varies from 50% to 85% of the bottom line. Afren's Ebok field is exempt from  paying PPT until May 2016, which significantly benefits Afren's cash flows and  should allow it to finance new projects, while keeping leverage relatively  moderate for the 'B' rating category. The company believes that the Petroleum  Industry Bill (PIB), if finally passed by the local parliament, should not  affect the tax holiday. At the same time, we believe that the proposed oil  industry reform creates some uncertainty over Afren's future tax payments and  makes its cash flows less predictable, since the reform's key parameters have  not been finalised. The PIB, which calls for an increase of the government's  revenue from the sector and changes in taxes and royalty structures, has been  debated since 2009 and re-drafted several times. We have no views regarding the  timing of the bill's passage into law.   Country Risks Remain Afren is exposed to high emerging market country risks as its operations are  concentrated in Nigeria (BB-/Stable). Historically, development of the oil and  natural gas sector has been constrained by instability in the Niger Delta, with  local groups often attacking companies in the area leading to shut-in  production, as well as by oil bunkering, or theft. Afren is less vulnerable to  these risks as all of its largest assets in the country, excluding OML 26, are  offshore. The company is also exposed to high regulatory and especially tax  risks in Nigeria. Afren's entry to Kurdistan should partially mitigate these  risks over time, but we will only be able to give the company credit for some  geographical diversification when it manages to boost production outside Nigeria  to more than 30%-40%.   Uncertainty Over Kurdistan In order to monetise its massive oil reserves in Kurdistan Afren needs to get  access to a secure export channel. In 1Q14 its Barda Rash field yielded around  500 barrels of oil per day, all sold domestically, and ramping-up production to  above 5mboe/d may not be feasible without access to a pipeline. The central  government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) have been in a  dispute over the regulation and taxation of the oil industry in Kurdistan,  prompting Kurdistan to build an alternative 300mbbl/d export pipeline to Turkey,  which was commissioned in 2013 but has remained mostly idle due to political  concerns. We believe that the company's growth strategy in Kurdistan may be  affected by highly unpredictable political factors and assume in our modelling  that progress there will be rather slow.  Substantive Exploration Portfolio Afren has a wide exploration portfolio, including seven licence blocks in East  Africa. Its exploration activity has borne some fruit, in 2013 the company  announced it made a significant oil discovery at the Ogo prospect in Nigeria,  which can potentially enhance its reserve base and production prospects. Afren's  relatively low proved reserve life relative to peers means that the company  needs to constantly replenish its reserves, and the vast exploration portfolio  may be helpful in this respect.Solid Financial Profile Afren now has a relatively low debt burden for the 'B' rating category. Funds  from operations (FFO) adjusted gross leverage stayed at 1.8x at end-2013, and  although we believe it may moderately increase on the back of high capital  intensity, it should stay below 2.5x on a sustained basis under our conservative  assumptions, including declining price deck and no substantial production  upside. Afren can also be free cash flow negative in some periods. We do not  expect Afren to pay any dividends in the medium term, as per its dividend  policy.RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - Net production exceeding 100mboe/d on a sustained basis. - Production becoming less concentrated, with no single country accounting for  more than 2/3 of the overall output on a sustained basis. - FFO adjusted gross leverage below 2x on a sustained basis. - Sustainably positive FCF. - More clarity regarding the evolution of tax environment in Nigeria. - Getting access to secure export channels in Kurdistan and ramping-up  production at Barda Rash.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - FFO adjusted gross leverage exceeding 2.5x on a sustained basis. - Net production declining and settling below 35mboe/d. - Unfavourable tax changes in Nigeria having a direct impact on Afren's cash  generating ability. - Significant project delays and cost overruns.   SOUND LIQUIDITY At 31 March 2014 Afren had no short-term debt, and cash of USD361m. In 2013, the  company improved its debt maturity profile by issuing a USD360m secured bond due  2020 and partially repaying its USD500m bond due 2016 (currently outstanding:  USD253m) and USD300m bond due 2019 (currently outstanding: USD250m).
