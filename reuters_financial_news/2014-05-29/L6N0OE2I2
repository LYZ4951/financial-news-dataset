MOSCOW, May 29 (Reuters) - Russia's second-biggest mobile phone operator Megafon <MFON.MM> <MFONq.L> said on Thursday its first-quarter net profit fell 43 percent from a year ago, missing expectations, due to increased depreciation and amortisation costs related to an acquisition.

Megafon, controlled by Russia's richest man Alisher Usmanov, reported a net profit of 7.2 billion roubles ($208 million), down from 12.6 billion roubles in the same period of 2013, while analysts had forecast 10 billion roubles. [ID:nL6N0OD4TQ] The bottom line was eroded by depreciation and amortisation costs related to the acquisition of Scartel as well as foreign exchange losses resulting from the rouble's weakening.
