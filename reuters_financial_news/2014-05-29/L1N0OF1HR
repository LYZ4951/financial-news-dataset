WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors have opened criminal probes of four payment processors, one bank and some officials as part of a wide-ranging consumer fraud probe, according to documents released on Thursday by a congressional committee.

The Justice Department was also investigating at least 10 banks and payment processors as of last November under a civil fraud law, the documents showed.
