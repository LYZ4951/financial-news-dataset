MOSCOW, May 29 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's biggest bank by assets, said it may consider a plan unveiled last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin to boost banks' capital and lending, but only if it makes economic sense.

Putin promised at an investment forum on Friday the government would help systemically-important banks by allowing them to convert subordinated loans to shares. That would boost their capital positions and free them up to lend more in support of economic growth.
