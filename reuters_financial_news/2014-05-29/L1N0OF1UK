May 29 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 is hovering near record levels but trading volume is still anemic.

Low volume has been a trend recently, with about 5.28 billion shares traded on average on all U.S. platforms over the past five sessions, according to BATS exchange data, well under the month-to-date average of 5.78 billion. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF <SPY.P>, which also hit a new record on Thursday, is on track for its lightest day of volume so far this year. Currently, about 40.8 million shares have exchanged hands in total composite trading, well below its 50-day average of 104.7 million shares. The ETF is up 0.3 percent at $191.97.

The stock is up 29 percent to $2.19 on volume of more than 14 million shares, making it one of the most active names on the Nasdaq. Over the past 25 sessions, the stock, which has a market capitalization of just over $41 million, has traded an average of about 450,000 shares. Shares of XG, which went public in July 2013, are up more 40 percent so far this year.

From earlier in the day: 12:52 - Data showing the U.S. economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter may be limiting Wall Street's advance on Thursday, but the composition of U.S. profits suggests the dip is only temporary, according to Wells Fargo. [ID:nL1N0OF0NN] The firm writes that when profits from domestic operations grow as a percent of total U.S. profits, that is a strong indicator of economic expansion.  "The United States often leads other counties out coming out of recession. Consequently, the stronger U.S. economy tends to generate more domestic profits than operations in the rest of the world," wrote Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis. Domestic profits currently make up about 80 percent of total U.S. profits, up from roughly 65 percent in 2009, Thayer noted, "signaling continued economic growth, not recession."Similarly, companies with domestic revenue exposure have been outperforming this year, reporting stronger earnings and sales growth, and beating expectations with bigger upside surprises. [ID:nL2N0NV28J] Index snapshot at 12:44: * S&P 500 <.SPX> is up 3.98 points, 0.21 percent. * Nasdaq Comp <.IXIC> is adding 11.11 points, 0.26 percent. * Dow industrials <.DJI> are up 15.3 points, 0.09 percent. * Russell 2000 <.TOY> is adding 2.7 points, 0.24 percent. * S&P MidCap <.IDX> is up 2.89 points, 0.21 percent. * S&P SmallCap <.SPCY> is up 1.03 points, 0.16 percent.   12:07 - U.S. stocks are mildly higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 rising to a record in early trading after jobless claims fell more than expected in the latest week.  Gains are broad-based, with almost 60 percent of stocks trading on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq higher on the day. Eight of the ten primary S&P 500 sectors are higher on the day, with only utilities and telecom - both defensive plays- lower.  Consumer staples <.SPLRCS> are the day's biggest outperformers, up 0.6 percent, lifted by Tyson Foods <TSN.N>, which rose 6.5 percent to $43.41 after offering to buy Hillshire Brands Co <HSH.N> for $6.13 billion, trumping an earlier bid from Pilgrim's Pride Corp <PPC.O>. [ID:nL3N0OF3BH] With the day's gain, the S&P is on track for its fifth daily rise out of the past six sessions. The claims data, which indicated improving conditions in the labor market of late, was enough to offset data showing the U.S. economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter. [ID:nL1N0OF0WG] Index snapshot at 12:05: * S&P 500 <.SPX> is up 4.18 points, 0.22 percent. * Nasdaq Comp <.IXIC> is adding 12.85 points, 0.3 percent. * Dow industrials <.DJI> are up 16.66 points, 0.1 percent. * Russell 2000 <.TOY> is adding 3.02 points, 0.27 percent. * S&P MidCap <.IDX> is up 2.98 points, 0.22 percent. * S&P SmallCap <.SPCY> is up 1.23 points, 0.19 percent.  From earlier in the day:   11:44 - U.S. shares of BlackBerry Ltd <BBRY.O> are rallying on heavy volume on Thursday, up 5.8 percent to $7.71 in their biggest one-day advance since February. Late Wednesday, BlackBerry's Chief Executive John Chen told CNBC he was "quite confident" the company - which is down more than 90 percent from all-time highs reached in 2008 - could be saved as it struggles to regain market share from such prominent players in the smartphone space as Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> iPhone. The stock was the sixth-most actively traded name on the Nasdaq, moving on volume of about 11.2 million shares, which easily outpaced its 50-day average of 5.7 million.  With the day's advance, the smartphone maker has turned positive for the year, though it remains a favorite for short sellers. Short interest is at 17.8 percent of outstanding shares as of May 15, according to Nasdaq. It is also seen as a likely candidate for a short squeeze, with a short squeeze indicator score of 92, according to Thomson Reuters data. Index snapshot at 11:27: * S&P 500 <.SPX> is up 4.08 points, 0.21 percent. * Nasdaq Comp <.IXIC> is adding 15.18 points, 0.36 percent. * Dow industrials <.DJI> are up 12.41 points, 0.07 percent. * Russell 2000 <.TOY> is adding 3.5 points, 0.31 percent. * S&P MidCap <.IDX> is up 3.51 points, 0.26 percent. * S&P SmallCap <.SPCY> is up 1.39 points, 0.21 percent.10:53 - Apple Inc <AAPL.O> is easily outperforming the broader market on Thursday, up 1 percent to $629.93 a day after the tech titan officially announced it would buy the music streaming and audio equipment company Beats for about $3 billion. [ID:nL3N0OE49V] The deal is Apple's biggest ever, but heavy merger and acquisition activity in the high-tech space is nothing new in 2014. Roughly $103 billion has been announced in deals in the high-tech space this year, comprising 7.3 percent of total worldwide announced M&A, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The year-to-date total is the biggest since 2000, during the dot-com bubble. By this point last year, only $61 billion in deals had been announced. Much of the M&A action this year is related to Facebook Inc's <FB.O> $19.5 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, which was announced in February.  Index snapshot at 10:36: * S&P 500 <.SPX> is up 2.23 points, 0.12 percent. * Nasdaq Comp <.IXIC> is adding 9.93 points, 0.23 percent. * Dow industrials <.DJI> are up 4.62 points, 0.03 percent. * Russell 2000 <.TOY> is falling 0.37 points, 0.03 percent. * S&P MidCap <.IDX> is down 0.3 points, 0.02 percent. * S&P SmallCap <.SPCY> is off 0.89 points, 0.14 percent.  10:00 - U.S. stocks are trading modestly higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 rising to another in a series of recent records. The move comes after the latest read on weekly jobless claims showed a bigger-than-expected drop in initial claims, a sign of improving conditions in the labor market. That was enough to offset a wider-than-expected contraction in first-quarter GDP. [ID:nLNSTGEAGY] [ID:nLNSTGEAGX] Index snapshot at 09:38: * S&P 500 <.SPX> is up 4.85 points, 0.25 percent. * Nasdaq Comp <.IXIC> is adding 13.31 points, 0.31 percent. * Dow industrials <.DJI> are up 25.88 points, 0.16 percent. * Russell 2000 <.TOY> is adding 3.28 points, 0.29 percent. * S&P MidCap <.IDX> is up 4.35 points, 0.32 percent. * S&P SmallCap <.SPCY> is up 1.62 points, 0.25 percent.  09:24-Palo Alto Networks Inc <PANW.N> is one of the biggest movers in Thursday's premarket session, jumping 12 percent on heavy volume a day after the company reported a sharp jump in revenue and settled patent litigation with Juniper Networks Inc <JNPR.N>. [ID:nL3N0OE48B] The stock moved on volume of about 285,000 shares and is on track for an eighth straight daily advance.  The cyber security software company is up about 30 percent this year, though it has recently come under weakness. While the stock is up about 1.3 percent so far in May, not including Thursday's premarket move, that comes after a drop of almost 11 percent in April.  Futures snapshot at 09:21: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 3.25 points, 0.17 percent, with 126,399 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 9.25 points, 0.25 percent in volume of 20,544 contracts. * Dow e-minis <YMc1> are up 29 points, 0.17 percent with 14,146 contracts changing hands.  09:00-U.S. stock index futures are very slightly higher on Thursday, with investors seeming to shrug off a report showing the economy contracted for the first time in three years in the first quarter, and by a wider decline than had been anticipated. [ID:nLNSTGEAGX] Economic data throughout the first quarter had been weak, with many analysts citing the impact of harsh winter weather. There have been signs of improving conditions since then, with jobless claims falling more than expected in the latest week. [ID:nLNSTGEAGY] Trading volume continued to be very light, and futures were little changed after the data. Futures snapshot at 08:48: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 2 points, 0.1 percent, with 100,300 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 3.5 points, 0.09 percent in volume of 14,150 contracts. * Dow e-minis <YMc1> are up 19 points, 0.11 percent with 11,580 contracts changing hands.  08:44-The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> is hovering near lows not seen since March 2013, but investor interest remains high, and several of the exchange-traded instruments that track the so-called "Fear Gauge" are drawing volume before the bell on Thursday. The VIX is down about 16 percent since the start of April, a drop reflected in the $1.1 billion iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note <VXX.P>, which is down almost 20 percent over that period, though it has seen inflows of about $262.3 million, according to data from ETF.com.  The $308 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures <UVXY.P> has shed 37 percent since the end of March; it has seen inflows of $197 million. The VXX was active before the bell Thursday, down 10 cents at $33.68 on more than 162,000 shares. The UVXY was also down, lower by 8 cents at $37.72, but volume was lighter at just under 25,000 shares. While the latest CFTC data indicated that traders were in aggregate taking a short position on the VIX, betting it will fall further, that hasn't been reflected in flows to ETFs and ETNs. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN <XIV.O>, which is designed to move in an opposite direction from the VIX, is up more than 22 percent since the start of April. It has seen outflows of $163.2 million over that period. In premarket action the XIV was up 10 cents at $38.84 on 67,100 shares of volume. Futures snapshot at 08:40: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 2 points, 0.1 percent, with 96,420 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 2.75 points, 0.07 percent in volume of 13,570 contracts. * Dow e-minis <YMc1> are up 18 points, 0.11 percent with 11,381 contracts changing hands.  07:53-U.S. stock index futures are very slightly higher in what looks to be a light day of trading on Thursday, with investors searching for reasons to push markets steadily higher with the S&P 500 near record levels. Traders may find market catalysts at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT), when data on first-quarter gross domestic product and jobless claims will be released.  The second read on GDP in the first three months of the year is seen showing the economy contracted by 0.5 percent, even weaker than the 0.1 percent expansion posted in the advance estimate a month ago. Meanwhile, jobless claims are seen falling by 8,000 to 318,000 in the latest week.  Major indexes closed modestly lower on Wednesday, with the S&P snapping a four-session rally, though the Dow Jones Transportation Average <.DJT> closed at another record. Futures snapshot at 07:50: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 1.25 points, 0.07 percent, with 63,054 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 3.75 points, 0.1 percent in volume of 8,617 contracts.
