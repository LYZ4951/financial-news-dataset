May 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Sunrise S.r.l. - Series 2014-1's notes expected ratings, as follows: EUR800m floating rate Class A, due May 2031: 'AA+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR303m floating rate Class M, due May 2031: 'A+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR301.7m Class J, due May 2031: 'NRsf' Final ratings are contingent upon the receipt of final documents and legal  opinions conforming to the information already received.  The issuance proceeds will be used to purchase a portfolio of performing  consumer loans granted to residents in Italy and originated by Agos Ducato  S.p.A. (Agos, BBB+/Stable/F2), for an outstanding aggregate principal balance of  about EUR1.4bn. Initially established in 1986, Agos is one of the largest  consumer finance players in Italy. Credit Agricole Consumer Finance [CAGRSO.UL] (A/Stable/F1) currently holds 61% of Agos's shares, while the remaining 39% is  held by Banco Popolare Soc. Coop <BAPO.MI> (BBB/Negative/F3). The ratings are based on Fitch's assessment of Agos's origination and servicing  procedures, expectations of future asset performance, available credit  enhancement, and the transaction's legal structure. As at 30 April 2014, the portfolio comprised 308,473 loans with an average  balance of EUR4,399 and included five different sub-pools with homogeneous  default risk: (i) personal loans (75.0% of the pool); (ii) new vehicles (8.3%);  (iii) used vehicles (5.8%); (iv) furniture (4.1%); (v) other finalised loans  (6.8%). Fitch analysed historical data provided by the originator for each  sub-pool. The class A and M notes will have have initial credit enhancement of 41.6% and  19.2%, respectively. It will be provided by overcollateralisation and by a  reserve to be funded on the issue date for an initial amount of EUR6.8m (0.5% of  the initial portfolio), with a subsequent build-up to 3% if the transaction  benefits from sufficient excess spread.  The transaction also benefits from a non-amortising liquidity reserve that will  be funded at closing (1% of the initial pool) to cover any shortfall on class A  and M interest and senior expenses.  An interest rate swap will be in place to hedge the mismatch between the fixed  rate assets and the floating rate notes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Majority of Personal Loans Of the portfolio, 75% will comprise unsecured personal loans, which are loans  with no specific purpose and present higher historical loss rates compared with  the other consumer loan products.  Performance in Line with Peers Fitch expects a weighted average (WA) lifetime default rate of 9% and a WA  recovery rate of 15% for the portfolio. We have applied a medium-low stress  multiple of 4.1x at 'AA+sf' and 3x at 'A+sf' to the default rate, in light of  the transaction characteristics.  High Excess Spread  Fitch expects the transaction to benefit from positive excess spread of  initially 6.6% per annum over the senior expenses and the interest on the class  A and M notes (taking the interest rate swap into account). This will support  the increase of the cash reserve towards its post-closing target of 3% of the  initial portfolio. It also means that the high prepayment scenario is the most  detrimental to the rating of the notes, due to the resulting reduction of the  portfolio WA interest rate.  Insurance-related Counterparty Risk The securitised loans also finance the purchase of insurance policies offered  together with the loan. The issuer could be exposed to certain claims by  borrowers if both Agos and an insurance company default. Fitch analysed the  exposure against available credit enhancement.  Sector Outlook and Sovereign Cap Fitch has a stable to declining outlook for Italian consumer ABS transactions.  The unemployment rate - the main risk factor for consumer securitisations - has  reached historically high levels and is expected to remain at such levels over  the next two years. The rating of the class A notes is equal to the cap on  Italian structured finance transactions, ie six notches above the rating of the  Republic of Italy (BBB+/Stable/F2).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected Deterioration in Portfolio Performance Unexpected increases in the default rate and loss severity on defaulted loans  could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's assumptions and could result in  potential rating actions on the notes. Rating sensitivity to increased default rate assumptions Class A notes Current expected rating: 'AA+sf' Increase in default rate by 10%: 'AA+sf' Increase in default rate by 25%: 'AAsf' Increase in default rate by 50%: 'AA-sf' Class M notes Current expected rating: 'A+sf' Increase in default rate by 10%: 'Asf' Increase in default rate by 25%: 'A-sf' Increase in default rate by 50%: 'BBBsf' Rating sensitivity to reduced recovery rate assumptions Class A notes Current expected rating: 'AA+sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 10%: 'AA+sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 25%: 'AA+sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'AA+sf' Class M notes Current expected rating: 'A+sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 10%: 'A+sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 25%: 'A+sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'A+sf' Rating sensitivity to multiple factors Class A notes Current expected rating: 'AA+sf' Increase in default rate by 10%, decrease in recovery rate by 10%: 'AA+sf' Increase in default rate by 25%, decrease in recovery rate by 25%: 'AAsf' Increase in default rate by 50%, decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'A+sf' Class M notes Current expected rating: 'A+sf' Increase in default rate by 10%, decrease in recovery rate by 10%: 'Asf' Increase in default rate by 25%, decrease in recovery rate by 25%: 'A-sf' Increase in default rate by 50%, decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'BBBsf' Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the presale  report, which will be available at www.fitchratings.com.
