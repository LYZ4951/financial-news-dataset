BOSTON, May 29 (Reuters) - The city of Providence, Rhode Island, on Thursday said it filed a federal lawsuit against Santander Bank <SAN.MC> alleging it refused to make prime mortgages available in minority neighborhoods.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, claims that since 2009, Santander deliberately reduced its lending in minority neighborhoods while expanding in predominately white neighborhoods, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act.
