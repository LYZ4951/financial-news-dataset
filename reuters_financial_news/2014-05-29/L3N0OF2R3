SINGAPORE, May 29 (Reuters) - Singapore-listed companies will adopt a new financial reporting framework similar to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2018, an accounting body and the city state's stock exchange said on Thursday.

Singapore Exchange <SGXL.SI> will work closely with the Singapore Accounting Standards Council (ASC) to engage Singapore-listed companies on the transition to the new framework, ASC Chairman Michael Lim said in a statement. "Singapore has long been an advocate of a single global financial reporting language," Lim said.  "Taking the final leap towards full convergence with IFRS for our capital market is a decisive step towards cementing Singapore's standing as a trusted international financial and business centre."  Singapore-listed companies must apply the new financial reporting framework for annual periods beginning on or after  January 1, 2018, the statement said.
