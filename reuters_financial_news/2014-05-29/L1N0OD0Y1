TORONTO, May 29 (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce <CM.TO> said on Thursday its second-quarter profit fell by nearly two-thirds, hurt by C$543 million in charges related to its Caribbean banking unit.

The bank, Canada's fifth-largest, also raised its dividend by 2 percent. CIBC earned C$306 million ($281.68 million), or 73 Canadian cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended April 30. That compared with a year-before profit of C$862 million, or C$2.09 a share.
