May 29 (Reuters) - The CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> is hovering near lows not seen since March 2013, but investor interest remains high, and several of the exchange-traded instruments that track the so-called "Fear Gauge" are drawing volume before the bell on Thursday.

The VIX is down about 16 percent since the start of April, a drop reflected in the $1.1 billion iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note <VXX.P>, which is down almost 20 percent over that period, though it has seen inflows of about $262.3 million, according to data from ETF.com.  The $308 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures <UVXY.P> has shed 37 percent since the end of March; it has seen inflows of $197 million. The VXX was active before the bell Thursday, down 10 cents at $33.68 on more than 162,000 shares. The UVXY was also down, lower by 8 cents at $37.72, but volume was lighter at just under 25,000 shares. While the latest CFTC data indicated that traders were in aggregate taking a short position on the VIX, betting it will fall further, that hasn't been reflected in flows to ETFs and ETNs. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN <XIV.O>, which is designed to move in an opposite direction from the VIX, is up more than 22 percent since the start of April. It has seen outflows of $163.2 million over that period. In premarket action the XIV was up 10 cents at $38.84 on 67,100 shares of volume. Futures snapshot at 08:40: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 2 points, 0.1 percent, with 96,420 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 2.75 points, 0.07 percent in volume of 13,570 contracts. * Dow e-minis <YMc1> are up 18 points, 0.11 percent with 11,381 contracts changing hands.  From earlier in the day: 07:53-U.S. stock index futures are very slightly higher in what looks to be a light day of trading on Thursday, with investors searching for reasons to push markets steadily higher with the S&P 500 near record levels. Traders may find market catalysts at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT), when data on first-quarter gross domestic product and jobless claims will be released.  The second read on GDP in the first three months of the year is seen showing the economy contracted by 0.5 percent, even weaker than the 0.1 percent expansion posted in the advance estimate a month ago. Meanwhile, jobless claims are seen falling by 8,000 to 318,000 in the latest week.  Major indexes closed modestly lower on Wednesday, with the S&P snapping a four-session rally, though the Dow Jones Transportation Average <.DJT> closed at another record. Futures snapshot at 07:50: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 1.25 points, 0.07 percent, with 63,054 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 3.75 points, 0.1 percent in volume of 8,617 contracts.
