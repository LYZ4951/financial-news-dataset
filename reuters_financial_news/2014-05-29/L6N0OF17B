May 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's M3 money supply growth decelerated to 13.3 percent year-on-year at the end of April from 13.6 percent in the previous month, which was the fastest rate since August 2013, central bank data showed on Thursday.

Bank lending growth to the private sector eased to 11.8 percent in April, the slowest clip since January 2012, from 12.8 percent in March. The central bank's net foreign assets climbed to a record high of 2.732 trillion riyals ($728 billion) in April, up 9.0 percent from a year ago, the lowest rate since February 2011.
