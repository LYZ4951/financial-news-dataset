LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Uk private equity firm Electra <ELTA.L> said on Thursday that it had met with activist investor Edward Bramson but was unaware of any attempt by the famously aggressive stakeholder to influence the group's strategy.

"We have had one meeting with Sherborne," said Electra's Chief Investment Partner Alex Fortescue, referring to Bramson's investment vehicle. "After that, we have come out not aware of any specific agenda."
