May 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> (A/Stable/F1) undated subordinated notes a 'BBB+' rating. The notes were issued by Volkswagen International Finance NV [VOWGI.UL].  KEY RATING DRIVERS The hybrid notes are rated two notches below Volkswagen's Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'A', reflecting the securities' increased loss severity  and heightened risk of non-performance relative to senior obligations. The  hybrid notes are subordinated to Volkswagen's senior unsecured debt and are  unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Volkswagen. Coupon payments can be  deferred at the issuer's discretion. The notching approach is in accordance with  Fitch's criteria, "Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporate  and REIT Credit Analysis" on www.fitchratings.com.  The securities qualify for 50% equity credit as they meet Fitch's criteria with  regard to subordination, effective maturity of at least five years, full  discretion to defer coupons for at least five years and limited events of  default, as well as the absence of material covenants and look-back provisions.
