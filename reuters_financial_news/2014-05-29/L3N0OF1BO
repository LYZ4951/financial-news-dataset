BANGKOK, May 29 (Reuters) - Philippine shares fell to their lowest in nearly a month on Thursday after first-quarter GDP growth came in lower than expectations, while Thai stocks extended gains as rice payments to farmers and government spending plans were seen reviving consumption.

The Philippine main index <.PSI> was down 1.05 percent at 6,716.84, the lowest since May 2. Large caps underperformed, led by shares of Ayala Land Inc <ALI.PS> and Metropolitan Bank & Trust <MBT.PS>, each down more than 2 percent. The Philippine economy unexpectedly grew at its slowest annual pace in over two years in the first quarter, hurt by the impact of last year's super typhoon, but analysts stayed optimistic robust consumption and investment would support growth ahead.

Builder Ch Karnchang <CK.BK>, telecoms firm Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> and retailer Big C Supercenter <BIGC.BK> were among the gainers. Nomura analysts are more positive on Thailand's retail sector, mainly due to the prospect of a recovery in consumption, with Big C among its top picks. "We believe the worst has passed for the retail sector," they wrote in a report.
