HONG KONG, May 29 (Reuters) - China shares slipped back to negative territory on Thursday, hurt by weaker stockbrokers and profit-taking by investors who rotated out of recent high-performers.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.5 percent at 2,040.60 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.7 percent. Shares of securities brokers were the biggest index drags. CITIC Securities <600030.SS>, China's largest listed brokerage, was down 1.7 percent, while Haitong Securities <600837.SS> shed 1.5 percent. Health-related stocks outperformed, thanks to newly-announced reform policies allowing private companies more access to the healthcare system.   Jointown Pharmaceutical Group <600998.SS> surged 6.9 percent, Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine <600276.SS> gained 2.1 percent, and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group <600196.SS> added 1.3 percent.
