PARIS, May 29 (Reuters) - French state-owned investment fund Bpifrance said it would support a bid from technology services group Atos <ATOS.PA> to buy rival Bull <BUL.PA>, in which it owns 3.2 percent.

Atos has offered to buy Bull for 4.90 euros per share, valuing the target at 620 million euros ($843 million), to strengthen its position in the fast-growing cloud computing services sector.
