May 29 (Reuters) - Money supply (M2) growth in Qatar slowed to 8.9 percent year-on-year at the end of April, the slowest rate since June 2012, from 15.9 percent in the previous month, central bank data showed on Thursday.

Total bank credit grew 12.3 percent on an annual basis in April, the lowest clip this year and down from 14.5 percent in March. Non-resident deposits fell 24.4 percent on an annual basis but grew 3.0 percent month-on-month to 31.89 billion riyals ($8.8 billion).
