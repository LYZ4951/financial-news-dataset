LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Talks with creditors of Kazakhstan's wealth fund-controlled Alliance Bank have broken down without agreement, the bank's chief executive said on Thursday.

"Negotiations have broken down, no agreement was reached," Timur Isatayev told Reuters by telephone. The bank met a creditor committee over the past two days and offered improved terms compared with an initial debt restructuring offer made in January, Isatayev said. Alliance is 67 percent owned by local sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna but needs to find new investors after Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev last year ordered the fund to sell holdings in several local banks which it bailed out in the global crisis.
