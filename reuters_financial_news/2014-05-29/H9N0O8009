HONG KONG, May 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished lower on Thursday, as gains from a stronger Chinese insurance sector narrowed in the afternoon and were outweighed by weaker index heavyweight Tencent.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.3 percent at 23,010.14 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent. Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> shed 3.1 percent, the biggest drag on Hong Kong's benchmark index. China's state media reported this week China will begin a month-long crackdown on the company's popular WeChat messaging application, the latest in a series of curbs on online freedom of expression.

China Life Insurance <2628.HK> added another 1.0 percent after Wednesday's 3 percent jump, closing at its highest since April 17.
