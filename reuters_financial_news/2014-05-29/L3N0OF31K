MUMBAI, May 30 (Reuters) - Sequoia Capital, best known for its early-stage investments in companies such as Google Inc <GOOGL.O>, has raised $530 million for its fourth India-focused fund, the U.S. venture capital fund said in a statement on Friday.

With the new fund, the total capital committed to Sequoia's India-focused investments will be around $2 billion, it said in the statement. The U.S. fund's strategy in India includes seed, venture and growth investments. Sequoia Capital is invested in more than 75 companies including Just Dial <JUST.NS>, handset maker Micromax Informatics Ltd, and Vasan Eye Care Ltd.
