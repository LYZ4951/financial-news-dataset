MOSCOW, May 29 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM> <SBNCyq.L>, Russia's biggest bank by assets, said first-quarter net income fell 18 percent due to increased provisions for loan losses following the Ukraine crisis and as Russia's economy deteriorates.

State-controlled Sberbank - widely viewed as a proxy for the broader Russian economy - said first-quarter net profit was 72.9 billion roubles ($2.1 billion) versus 88.5 billion a year ago. It was below a Reuters poll forecast of 78.2 billion roubles. Russia's No.2 lender VTB <VTBR.MM> on Tuesday reported a plunge in its net profit and a rise in bad loan provisions. [ID:nL6N0OD1LG]
