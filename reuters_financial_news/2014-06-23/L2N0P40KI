New York, June 23 (Reuters) - The "accountability guarantee" that Charles Schwab Corp <SCHW.N> unveiled with fanfare in December has to date cost the San Francisco-based financial firm pocket money only.

In a press tour and national ad campaign featuring the caring sincerity of its eponymous founder, Schwab promised to refund the previous quarter's advisory fee to any customer in certain fee-based accounts who complains about service or other issues. [ID:nL1N0JO1VN]  So far, only about 400 clients out of about 340,000 account holders who are eligible for the rebate have asked for and received the rebate, Schwab executive vice president and co-head of retail brokerage John Clendening said at Reuters Wealth Management Summit last week. He did not give the total dollar amount. Company officials say the campaign aims to build investor confidence in its brand as distrust of large banks and bank-owned brokerage firms among consumers remains high five years after the U.S. financial crisis.  "[W]e'll refund your program fee from the previous quarter and work with you to make things right," says a webpage for the guarantee featuring a photo of a bespectacled Chuck Schwab looking determinedly into the distance. "You won't find that kind of accountability everywhere - but you will find it here."

The guarantee applies to five of the company's in-house fee-based investment and advice programs. Like its full-service competitors such as Morgan Stanley's <MS.N> and Bank of America's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch retail brokerage arms, Schwab seeks to convert clients to fee-based accounts tied to their assets that provide more stable income than commissions that come in only if clients trade.Clendening said only 17 percent of assets from clients who work through Schwab's approximately 300 branches are in fee-based accounts, giving it room to grow considering about 25 to 40 percent of client assets at full-service firms are in advisory programs.  Schwab is not featuring the guarantee in its new ad campaign launched two weeks ago but will market it "on and off" and continue highlighting it on websites and other client-facing material. Complaints induced by the guarantee, such as one from a wealthy investor who was unhappy about a mishandled wire transfer from an account, helps Schwab avoid the loss of new money from disgruntled but silent customers who want to avoid the awkwardness of firing their broker, he said. "We want all of our clients to know that the guarantee is there," Clendening said. "We are not hoping ... that redemptions are minimal, which is the approach in other industries."
