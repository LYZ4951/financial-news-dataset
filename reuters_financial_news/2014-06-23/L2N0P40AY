NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open little changed on Monday after a six-day rally in the benchmark S&P 500, as upbeat manufacturing data in China was offset by soft readings on business activity in Europe.

* The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.8 in June from May's final reading of 49.4, beating a Reuters poll forecast of 49.7 and creeping  above the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from contraction. It was the first time in six months that activity in China's factory sector had expanded, thanks to a surge in new orders. [ID:nL4N0P10WO] * But Markit's Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone fell to 52.8 from May's 53.5, well below the estimate for 53.5 in a Reuters survey, with France being a notable laggard and showing contraction. [ID:nL6N0P41OV][ID:nL9N0O202P] * The S&P 500 <.SPX> has risen for six straight sessions, gaining 1.7 percent over that span in its longest streak of advances since mid-April.  * Markit's flash PMI reading for the U.S. for June is due at 9:00 a.m. (1300 GMT). Expectations call for a reading of 56.5 for the month, just above the prior 56.4.  * Later in the session at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT). Existing home sales data for May is due, with expectations for a rise to an annual rate of 4.73 million units from 4.65 million in April. * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> were up 0.75 point and indicated a flat open against fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <1YMc1> fell 4 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> lost 1.25 points. * France won an option to buy 20 percent of Alstom <ALSO.PA> from construction group Bouygues on Sunday in an eleventh-hour deal, clearing the way for the agreed sale of Alstom's energy business to General Electric <GE.N>. [ID:nL6N0P317H] <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Morning Call: GE wins French support on Alstom deal  http://reut.rs/UzHP5R ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> * Oracle Corp <ORCL.N> said it would buy Micros Systems <MCRS.O> in a $5.3 billion deal to expand its offerings in the hospitality and retail industries. Micros shares rose 3 percent to $67.75 before the opening bell. Oracle shares were up 0.5 percent. [ID:nL4N0P433B] * Wisconsin Energy <WEC.N> said it would buy Integrys Energy Group Inc <TEG.N> in a deal valued at $9.1 billion to create a larger, more diverse Midwest electric and natural gas delivery company. Integrys shares were up 11.2 percent to $67.80 in premarket trading.For Market Pulse:  [WATCH/US]  For running updates on what's moving U.S. stocks: [STXNEWS/US] ==============================================================  For other U.S. market data and news:   U.S. Equities speed guide........................<US/EQUITY>   S&P 500 index ........................................<.SPX>   Dow Jones industrial average..........................<.DJI>   Nasdaq Composite index...............................<.IXIC>   Nasdaq 100............................................<.NDX>   Thomson Reuters US Index .......................<.TRXFLDUSP>  Russell 2000 small cap................................<.RUT>   S&P major sectors..............................<0#.GSPMAJOR>   NYSE most active.....................................<.AV.N>   Nasdaq most active...................................<.AV.O>   Top NYSE pct gainers.................................<.PG.N>   Top NYSE pct losers..................................<.PL.N>   Top Nasdaq pct gainers...............................<.PG.O>   Top Nasdaq pct losers................................<.PL.O>   52 week highs:  NYSE...............<t.YH.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YH.O>   52 week lows:  NYSE...............<t.YL.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YL.O>Main global stock indexes and market reports:   FTSE Eurotop 300 .....<.FTEU3>  European report .......[.EU]   Nikkei 225.............<.N225>  Tokyo report............[.T]   FTSE 100...............<.FTSE>  London report...........[.L]   Xetra DAX.............<.GDAXI>  Frankfurt market stories[.F]   CAC-40.................<.FCHI>  Paris market stories...[.PA]   World Indices.....................................<0#.INDEX>   Reuters survey of world bourse outlook.........<EQUITYPOLL1>   U.S. IPO diary........................................[IPO/]   U.S. Asset Allocation Table.......................[US/ASSET] More Reuters News on equities at a glance:   Equities ............[E]   US company news.........[TOP/EQU]Key non-equities market reports:   Foreign exchange......................................[FRX/]   Oil....................................................[O/R]   US Treasuries.........................................[US/N]   International bonds...................................[EUB/]   Gold.......................................[GOL/X] or [GOL/]   ))  Keywords: MARKETS USA STOCKS
