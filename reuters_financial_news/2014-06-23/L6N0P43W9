LISBON, June 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank BES <BES.LS> fell sharply on Monday after Friday's proposed change of its chief executive and most of the board, on uncertainties about whether regulators and shareholders will accept the plan.

The founding family of Banco Espirito Santo has accepted patriarch Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado will step down from the executive board along with other family members, proposing chief financial officer Amilcar Morais Pires - seen as close to Salgado - as his successor. [ID:nL6N0P11IY] The replacement, as well as the plan to create a new consultative committee to be chaired by Salgado, will have to be approved by shareholders on July 31, after which the governance model is to be submitted to the Bank of Portugal. Adding to last week's declines, shares in BES slumped 4.9 percent to 0.837 euros by 1405 GMT, after dropping as low as 0.826 euros - their lowest since November. "There is still uncertainty as the general assembly is more than a month away and due to the fact that the Bank of Portugal also has to confirm the plan," says Albino Oliveira, an analyst at Fincor. Vanda Mesquita, an analyst at Millennium Investment Bank, said: "This (management) solution appears very similar to what the current CEO advocates. It remains to be seen whether it will be enough to reestablish confidence." Earlier, sources familiar with the matter had said the Bank of Portugal had pushed for Salgado's resignation following the discovery of financial irregularities at a holding company that owns a stake in BES.
