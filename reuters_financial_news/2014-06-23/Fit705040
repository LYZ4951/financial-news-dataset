June 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Eurosail-UK Prime 2007-A's  class A1 notes and assigned ratings to the class A2, M, B and C notes, as  follows: GBP117,477,000 Class A1: upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable GBP17,825,400 Class A2: assigned 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable GBP9,144,889 Class M: assigned 'Asf'; Outlook Stable GBP8,967,461 Class B: assigned 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable GBP11,655,614 Class C: assigned 'Csf'; Recovery Estimate of 45% GBP500,000 Class CR: not rated  The rating actions reflect the second stage restructuring of the transaction on  16 June 2014, following the first stage restructuring that was executed on 6  February 2014 (see 'Fitch Takes Various Rating Actions on Two Eurosail UK RMBS  on Restructuring', dated 14 April 2014 at www.fitchratings.com).  KEY RATING DRIVERS New Capital Structure The second phase of the transaction restructure involves a restatement of the  outstanding class A note balance to GBP117.5m from GBP135.3m and a subsequent  renaming of the tranche to class A1. Simultaneously, the existing class M, B, C  and D tranches have been cancelled and new notes - the class A2, M, B, C and CR  - have been issued. The aggregate current balance of the newly-restated class A1  and newly-issued class A2 equates to the pre-restructured class A note balance.  Similarly, the aggregate balance of the newly-restructured class M, B, C and CR  is equivalent to that of the pre-restructured class M, B, C and D notes. As a result of the restructuring, the available credit enhancement for the rated  A1, A2, M, B and C notes presently stands at 29.7%, 18.9%, 13.4%, 8.0% and 0.9%,  respectively. The credit support is contributed by a GBP1.5m reserve fund that  is permitted to amortise once it reaches 1.5% of the outstanding note balance  (currently 0.9%) to a floor amount of GBP0.5m; provided amongst various  conditions that the three-months plus arrears (which have been redefined, as  part of the first stage restructure, to exclude delinquencies owing to  outstanding fees and charges) do not exceed the trigger threshold of 15%.  Liquidity Enhancement From the September 2014 payment date, principal receipts up to a cumulative  amount of GBP1.8m will be diverted towards the establishment of a liquidity  reserve. This liquidity reserve is available to cover class A1 interest  shortfalls and will amortise from September 2015 provided that it is fully  funded in the prior period and no drawing is required on the current payment  date. Following a full depletion of the liquidity reserve, the transaction structure  also now incorporates the ability for principal to be diverted to cover interest  shortfalls on the class A1 in all instances and for the class A2 provided that  the principal deficiency does not exceed 75% of the class A2 note balance.  Robust Asset Performance The underlying portfolio includes a relatively large portion of interest-only  mortgages (85%) and loans that were originated at the peak of the market in 2007  (88%). Additionally, buy-to-let mortgages and self-certified borrowers make up  57% and 43% of the portfolio, respectively. Despite these adverse  characteristics, the portfolio has continued to perform well, with three-months  plus arrears as of March 2014 at less than 0.7% of the outstanding collateral  balance. Additionally, the number of properties taken into possession over the  life of the transaction has remained limited so that losses incurred to date  currently stand at 16bp of the original portfolio balance. Consequently, in its  analysis, Fitch has given credit to the asset's robust performance by reducing  the underwriting hit applied in the derivation of the portfolio's overall  default probability. Nonetheless, the agency remains cautious about the  potential implications on affordability when interest rates rise (expected  before the end of 2015) considering the relatively low current portfolio  weighted-average interest rate of 2.6%.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A modest rise in interest rates could lead to deterioration of the asset  portfolio performance. If losses exceed Fitch's expectations, the relatively  thin reserve fund could provide insufficient support against depleting excess  spread levels and negative rating actions could be taken, particularly on the  junior tranches.
