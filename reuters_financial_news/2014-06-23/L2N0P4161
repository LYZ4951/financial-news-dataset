NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has withdrawn a controversial proposal that would require brokers to disclose to customers signing bonuses and other compensation they receive to move to a new firm.

FINRA, as the brokerage industry self-regulator is known, asked the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday to withdraw consideration of the rule that it had submitted on March 10, 2014. A spokesman said it plans to refile the rule later this year.
