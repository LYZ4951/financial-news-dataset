HONG KONG, June 23 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index had its worst day in more than three months on Monday, with a small morning gain on a good flash China PMI number wiped out by across-the-board tumbles in the afternoon that seemed to catch analysts off guard.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 1.7 percent at 22,804.81 points, its biggest daily percentage loss since March 20.  The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong slid 1.9 percent, its worst day since April 15. Traders seemed at a loss to explain the slide. Some said it was triggered by profit-taking by investors worried about a near-term correction on the index, which had held above the 23,000-level for two weeks. Index futures-related trading was another factor, according to analysts.  Nearly all Hang Seng components fell. Property developers were some of the heaviest hit, with Sino Land <0083.HK> down 3.9 percent and New World Development <0017.HK> off 2.5 percent.  China's big four banks were all weaker. Bank of China <3988.HK> sank 2.6 percent to its lowest level since May 7, a big drag on the H-share index.
