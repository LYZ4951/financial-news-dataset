June 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned JSC National Company  Kazakhstan Temir Zholy's (KTZ) CHF100m 2.590% notes due 2019 and CHF185m 3.638%  notes due 2022 a final foreign currency senior unsecured rating of 'BBB'. The  notes are guaranteed by KTZ's subsidiaries JSC Kaztemirtrans and JSC Locomotive. The senior unsecured rating is in line with KTZ's Long-term foreign currency  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB'/Stable. The bonds' proceeds will be used to  finance the development of infrastructure projects of KTZ-Express, KTZ's new  wholly owned logistics subsidiary as well as to finance its own capital  expenditures and for its general corporate purposes.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Links With State KTZ's ratings reflect its 100% state ownership, indirectly owned through the JSC  National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna (S-K), and strategic importance to  Kazakhstan (BBB+/Stable/F2) as monopoly owner/operator of the Kazakhstan rail  infrastructure and provider of around half of the freight and passenger  transportation in the country. KTZ's tariffs are regulated and its investment  plans approved, and directly co-funded by the state through equity injections  and loans. The government also provides direct subsidies for the loss-making  passenger business.  However, despite relatively substantial and timely financial support, KTZ's  ratings are one notch lower than the state given the absence of explicit  guarantees but also past instruction by the state for KTZ to undertake  relatively sizeable social projects at the group's expense.   Sound Operating Performance Fitch expects KTZ's earnings will continue to be supported by fairly robust  volumes due to still strong GDP growth rates (expected by Fitch to be in excess  of 5.5% in 2014 and 2015) and demand for the transportation of commodities,  KTZ's key revenue driver. The 8% proposed average tariff increase for 2014 is  also expected to be supportive, although it remains lower than pre-2013 levels.  Growth rates are therefore unlikely to witness the highs of previous years, due  in part to some dampening effect of the unification of tariffs in the Single  Economic Space, expected to lead to reduced export tariffs, which accounts for  around 40% of KTZ's freight turnover. Nevertheless, cost optimisation programmes  aimed at increasing efficiency should help offset pricing pressures and maintain  margin levels as witnessed in 9M13.   Material Capex Drives Increased Leverage Continued material increases in capex are expected to drive sizeable negative  free cash flow (FCF) over the medium term despite the expectation of strong  earnings and cash flow from operations (CFO). In line with management's  guidance, Fitch forecasts capex of over KZT1.1trn compared with CFO of roughly  KZT700m over FY13-FY15. Fitch acknowledges that a large proportion of capex  (around 80%) is discretionary and where willing, may be deferred or cancelled by  KTZ. However, assuming the full capex spend, Fitch forecasts that funds from  operations (FFO) gross adjusted leverage may weaken to over 3.0x, whilst fixed  charge cover is likely to deteriorate to about 5.0x.   Weaker Standalone Credit Profile KTZ's business profile remains strong, benefiting from its monopolistic  position, relatively diversified product and customer mix with balanced exposure  to domestic, transit and export markets. However, the expected weakening in  credit metrics, particularly increased leverage and negative FCF generation,  places considerable pressure on the company's underlying credit quality. Whilst  KTZ's ratings are, and are expected to remain related to the sovereign's credit  quality, we would not consider KTZ's standalone credit profile commensurate with  a low 'BBB' rating while leverage exceeds 3.0x on a continuous basis. If credit  metrics are allowed to weaken substantially, this could prompt Fitch to  reconsider the strength of ties between KTZ and its parent company.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: - A positive change in Kazakhstan's rating may be replicated on KTZ (with the  current one-notch differential), unless its links with the state weaken.  - A material strengthening in KTZ's standalone credit profile to in line with  the sovereign rating. This is currently considered unlikely but could be  possible if credit metrics substantially improve owing to a material increase in  earnings and/or decrease in capex leading to a strengthening in FFO adjusted  leverage.   Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - A negative change in Kazakhstan's rating would be replicated on KTZ unless  KTZ's standalone profile significantly strengthens. - A sustained increase in gross leverage beyond 3.0x would put pressure on KTZ's  standalone profile and may prompt Fitch to reconsider the strength of state  support. However, Fitch expects KTZ to moderate leverage through a reduction in  capex where necessary, especially taking into account some bank covenants and an  internal financial target set by S-K at around 3.5x debt/EBITDA.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Sufficient Liquidity At end-2013 cash and cash equivalents stood at about KZT86bn, sufficient to  cover short-term debt maturities of about KZT37bn. However, expected negative  FCF continues to add to funding requirements.   FX Risks
