HONG KONG, June 23 (Reuters) - Private equity backers including CDH are seeking up to HK$5.9 billion ($761.14 million) for the Hong Kong initial public offering of China's Luye Pharma Group Ltd, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.

The sellers include three China private equity funds, CDH Capital, Citic Private Equity and New Horizon Capital, who took a majority stake in the then-Singapore listed Luye Pharma in March 2012. The deal will see the shares priced at HK$5.38 to HK$5.92 each, the source said, declining to be identified because the matter is not yet public. The deal is set to price on July 3rd.
