NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - New York City's Rent Guidelines Board will vote on Monday night on whether to impose - for the first time since its creation in 1969 - a rent freeze on the 1 million apartments that fall under its mandate.

The potentially historic freeze, which would start in October, comes six months after Mayor Bill de Blasio took office pledging to confront mushrooming economic inequality that he said has created a "tale of two cities." Tenant advocates have been pushing for a rent freeze for years, saying average incomes have not kept pace with increased housing costs. De Blasio has said he thinks a one-year freeze would be appropriate, and 21 of the City Council's 51 members have called for a freeze. In 2013, the board approved a 4 percent increase on one-year leases, and a 7.75 percent increase on two-year leases - about double the increase from the previous year. But it was not immediately clear how the nine-member guidelines board, which includes five public members, two tenant representatives and two landlord representatives, would vote. Three of the public representatives were appointed to the board by de Blasio, while two other public members were appointed by his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, who was known to be less interested in government interference in business. Last month, de Blasio unveiled a plan to create and preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing over the next decade - a centerpiece of his strategy to address an "affordability crisis" in the nation's largest city. A report by New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer found that from 2000 to 2012, the median rental price in New York City rose by 75 percent, compared to 44 percent in the rest of the country, while the real incomes of New Yorkers declined.
