June 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Germany-based ERGO Versicherungsgruppe AG's (ERGO) operating insurance companies at Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings 'AA-' with Stable Outlook. The affected entities are ERGO Lebensversicherung AG (ERGO Life), DKV Deutsche  Krankenversicherung AG [DKV.UL] (DKV), VORSORGE Lebensversicherung AG (Vorsorge) and  Europaeische Reiseversicherung AG [EURO.UL] (ERV).  ERGO Life, DKV, Vorsorge and ERV are 100% subsidiaries of the holding company,  ERGO. Fitch has also affirmed ERGO's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'A+' with a Stable Outlook.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating actions follow the affirmation of Munich Re's IFS rating at 'AA-'  (see "Fitch Affirms Munich Re's IFS Rating at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable", dated 23  June 2014 on www.fitchratings.com). Munich Re <MUVGn.DE> is ERGO's 100% shareholder. ERGO's ratings reflect its core status within Munich Re's operations. ERGO Life,  DKV, Vorsorge, and ERV are viewed by Fitch as core to ERGO in terms of their  size and strategic importance.  ERGO is Munich Re's primary insurance group. At end-2013, ERGO had total assets  of EUR147.5bn (2012: EUR147.2bn) and reported net income of EUR435.9m (2012:  EUR290.3m). Fitch expects that ERGO's reported net income will be stable in  2014. It also expects that ERGO will maintain its strong underwriting  profitability in its German non-life business and further improve its  international underwriting profitability in 2014.
