CAIRO, June 23 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound was broadly steady at a central bank dollar sale on Monday and on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> on Monday. It had initially offered $40 million. At the central bank's previous dollar sale on Thursday, it sold at the same cut-off price of 7.1401. The dollar was offered for 7.40 pounds in the black market on Monday, compared to 7.39 on Sunday, according to two black market traders. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars <EGP=> are determined by the results of the central bank sales <EGYTV>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.
