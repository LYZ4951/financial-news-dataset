LISBON, June 23 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS>, who agreed to step down last week, said on Monday he expects a swift and transparent transition to new management as proposed by the main shareholder representing the founding family.

"Turning 70, I decided that it was time to pass the torch of executive leadership of Banco Espirito Santo," Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado wrote in an internal e-mail to BES employees, seen by Reuters. "A swift and clear generational transition will be ensured - a transition needed for a new cycle of growth and profitability, based on the team's enviable skill and competence and on the very important confidence of our clients," he wrote.
