FRANKFURT, June 23 (Reuters) - German roofing company Braas Monier <IPO-BMBG.F> will likely sell its shares at between 24 euros and 24.50 euros ($32.58-$33.26) apiece in a stock market listing later this week, two sources familiar with the transaction said on Monday.

"Banks are guiding investors to expect the pricing to be at 24-24.50 euros a share, books are covered well in this range", one of the sources said.  Braas Monier earlier this month announced a price range of 23 euros to 28 euros for the flotation that would be the largest in Germany so far this year, following the launches of car parts maker Stabilus <STAB.DE> and 3D printer maker SLM Solutions <AM3D.DE>.
