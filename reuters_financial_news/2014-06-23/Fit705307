June 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based  National Development Bank PLC's <NDB.CM> (NDB) Long-Term Foreign-Currency and  Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'B+' with a Stable Outlook. The  agency has also affirmed NDB's Viability Rating (VR) at 'b+'. The expected  rating of 'B+(EXP)' assigned to NDB's proposed USD notes issuance, has been  withdrawn as the bank no longer expects to proceed with the debt issue as  previously envisaged. NDB's National Long-Term Rating has also been affirmed at  'AA-(lka)' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is at the end of  this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VR, NATIONAL RATING AND DEBT NDB's IDRs, VR and National Rating reflect its intrinsic risk profile driven by  its long and relatively stable operating history with better asset quality and  capitalisation compared with rating peers, counterbalanced by its developing  franchise as a commercial bank.   NDB's subordinated debt is rated one notch below the National Long-Term Rating  to reflect its relatively lower recovery prospects in the event of liquidation. NDB is engaged in merger discussions with DFCC Bank <DFCC.CM> (B+/Stable). This is as a  part of the Government of Sri Lanka's "Master Plan" to consolidate the financial  system, which includes establishment of one large development bank to provide  impetus to policy-driven development banking activities in the country. Fitch  believes that the merged bank will primarily focus on supporting economic  development. Fitch is of the view that synergies from such an amalgamation could  be beneficial to the credit profile in the long run although credit neutral in  the short to medium term. Fitch will further comment on the matter once details  and the time frame of this deal become clearer. NDB's continued to experience strong loan growth of 18.6% in 2013, above the  average of 8.8% for the banking sector. Its loan book composition has remained  stable - SME and retail lending accounted for 36% and project finance accounted  for a 14% at end-2013 with the balance of 50% mostly stemming from the  commercial banking book. Unlike most of its peers, NDB was not significantly  affected by the sharp drop in global gold prices as its exposure to pawning  advances has been minimal and reduced to just 1% of loans at end-2013. Its  regulatory NPL ratio increased to 2.7% at 1Q14 and 2.5% at end-2013 from 1.3% at  end-2012, but remained better than that of its peers. The deterioration  reflected the seasoning of NDB's loan book in the aftermath of strong loan  expansion alongside a challenging macroeconomic environment Higher loan impairment charges affected NDB's profitability and the sector in  general. NDB's return on assets decreased to 1.43% in 2013 from 2% in FY12  (after adjusting for the one-off capital gain from the sale of its insurance  subsidiary). NDB's Fitch Core Capital (FCC) reduced to 15.2% at end-2013 from  18.7% at end-2012 (including the capital gain), but remained strong relative to  most peers. Fitch expects NDB's capitalisation to trend lower towards that of  its commercial bank peers, as NDB intends to sustain its growth momentum but  continue to remain healthy. NDB's share of CASA remained relatively low at 26% at 1Q14, reflecting its still  developing deposit franchise. The bank also benefits from funding lines from  multilateral agencies and such loans accounted for about 10% of NDB's loan book  at end-2013.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL RATING AND DEBT The consolidation of NDB's franchise alongside its ability to sustain strong  credit metrics could result in an upgrade of NDB's IDRs, VR and National Rating.  The IDRs, VR and National Rating could be downgraded if there is a sustained and  substantial increase in risk appetite that could materially weaken its capital  position.  The ratings of NDB's subordinated debt are primarily sensitive to changes in its  National Long-Term Rating.
