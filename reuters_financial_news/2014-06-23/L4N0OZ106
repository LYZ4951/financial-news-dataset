TOKYO, June 24 (Reuters) - Insurers across Southeast Asia are pursuing growth by buying up smaller rivals and the only way to maintain competitiveness is to follow suit, the new president of one of Japan's top insurers said.

MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc <8725.T> is looking for acquisition targets in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, where the insurer already boasts sizable market shares, said Yasuyoshi Karasawa, who on Monday became president of Japan's second-biggest property-casualty insurer by market value. "In (Southeast) Asian countries, insurers are actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions, becoming bigger than us. We have to hurry too," Karasawa, 63, told Reuters in an interview. Property-casualty insurers have been driven abroad by weak growth prospects in Japan's greying economy, as well as the need to spread risk geographically so profit generated overseas can help offset payouts for typhoon and earthquake damage at home. Southeast Asia has been a particular draw because of the pace of economic and income growth, Karasawa said, as well as the relative lack of insurance coverage - particularly in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country. MS&AD's recent purchases include 50 percent of Indonesia's PT Asuransi Jiwa Sinarmas for 67 billion yen in 2011, and 30 percent of the insurance subsidiary of Malaysia's Hong Leong Group for 26 billion yen in 2010. "Our policy is to do necessary mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in Asia," Karasawa said, adding the insurer does not have a specific M&A budget. In Southeast Asia, the executive said his company needs to be a top five property-casualty insurer in terms of premium revenue in each country "to have meaningful market presence". MS&AD is ranked in the top five in Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand, Karasawa said. In Indonesia, it ranks ninth. The impact of any acquisitions to boost market share was not factored into the insurer's medium-term business plan through the financial year ending March 2018, Karasawa said. Under the plan, MS&AD aims to increase overseas operations' core profit - or net profit excluding capital gains and losses as well as other items - to 39 billion yen from 18 billion yen in the just-ended year. INVESTMENT LIMIT In many Asian countries, foreign investment in insurance companies is often limited to minority stakes which Japanese companies regard as a hindrance to growth. In Thailand, for instance, the cap is 49 percent. Among the strictest is India where MS&AD owns the maximum permitted 26 percent of a life insurance joint venture with Max India Ltd <MAXI.NS> and a property-casualty insurance joint venture with Indian conglomerate Murugappa Group. Karasawa expects foreign investment rules to be relaxed under India's recently installed government led by a prime minister widely regarded as pro-business. "For the property-casualty joint venture, we would like to own over 50 percent," he said. "We want to increase our stake and involvement as soon as possible." Karasawa said the focus of MS&AD's acquisitions will be in Southeast Asia for the foreseeable future. The exception would be the Lloyd's insurance market in London, where insurers gather to underwrite policies brought by brokers. MS&AD operates the 23rd biggest underwriting syndicate at Lloyd's in terms of gross written premiums. Karasawa aims to take the syndicate into the top 10, and the quickest means of building up a syndicate is to buy rival Lloyd's members.
