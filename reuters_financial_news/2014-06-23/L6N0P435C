WARSAW, June 23 (Reuters) - Poland's Alumetal will sell shares at a maximum 44 zlotys each in its initial public offering (IPO), raising up to 369 million zlotys ($120 million) for the majority owner of the aluminium parts maker.

Alumetal's main shareholder, Poland-based private equity fund Abris, set the maximum IPO price on Monday. Abris plans to sell its entire 56 percent stake when Alumetal makes its debut on the Warsaw bourse <GPW.WA> at the end of this month or the beginning of July. Sources told Reuters in January the IPO was estimated to be worth between 200 million and 500 million zlotys. [ID:nL5N0KU2BN]  Alumetal, which has an annual capacity of 165,000 tonnes, produces components mostly for the automobile industry. It sells almost half of its output abroad, to clients including Germany's Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>.  Its revenue rose by more than a quarter in the first three months of this year to 311.4 million zlotys and net profit almost tripled to 17 million zlotys, thanks to a pick-up in European car production and sales. Alumetal's direct Polish rival Grupa Kety <KTY.WA> has a market capitalisation of 2 billion zlotys.
