DUBAI, June 23 (Reuters) - Turkish participation lender Albaraka Turk <ALBRK.IS> plans to complete a benchmark-sized sukuk issue with a five year lifespan on Monday, a document from lead arrangers said, with initial pricing thoughts for the deal announced.

The bank, a unit of Bahrain-based Al Baraka Banking Group <BARKA.BH>, aims to price the transaction in the area of low 6 percent, the document said. Benchmark sized is traditionally understood to mean in excess of $500 million.
