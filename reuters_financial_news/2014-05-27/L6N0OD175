TEL AVIV, May 27 (Reuters) - Real estate developer Azrieli Group agreed to sell Israeli paint company Tambour Ltd to Singapore-based holding company Kusto Group for 500 million shekels ($144 million).

The buyer made a payment of 70 million shekels upon the signing of the deal, Azrieli, which focuses on operating shopping malls, said in a statement. The company, which is controlled by Canadian businessman David Azrieli, said it expects to post an after-tax gain of 50 million shekels from the sale. Azrieli said the sale of Tambour is in line with the company's strategy of focusing on its core activities of income-producing real estate and selling non-related businesses. Israeli media reported in March that private equity firm Apax Partners [APAX.UL] was in talks to buy Tambour, which Azrieli controls through its subsidiary Granite HaCarmel, for 300 million shekels. Apax last week struck a deal to sell its 56 percent stake in Tnuva, Israel's largest food company, to China's Bright Food Group [SHMNGA.UL]. [ID:nL6N0O8015]
