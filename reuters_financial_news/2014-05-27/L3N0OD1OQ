HONG KONG, May 27 (Reuters) - Barclays <BARC.L> Asia-Pacific head of corporate finance Johan Leven and Asia-Pacific head of financial institutions group Helge Weiner-Trapness have quit the British bank, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

Barclays Asia Pacific operations have seen a series of senior exits since the bank announced a major restructuring this month, aimed at shrinking its investment banking division globally. Barclays declined to comment on the latest departures.
