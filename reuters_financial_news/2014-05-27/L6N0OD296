FRANKFURT, May 27 (Reuters) - German home improvement store operator Hornbach <HBHG_p.DE> said it plans to increase its dividend after a 10 percent rise in its core profit in the 2013/14 fiscal year.

In the fiscal year to the end of February 2014, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 10 percent to 160.4 million euros ($219 million), the company said on Tuesday.  Hornbach will propose a dividend of 0.80 euros per preferred share and 0.77 euros per ordinary share for the 2013/14 fiscal year after 0.67 euros and 0.64 euros the previous year, it said. Hornbach expects EBIT in the 2014/2015 year will grow more strongly than revenue, which it forecasts will rise by a mid single-digit percentage.
