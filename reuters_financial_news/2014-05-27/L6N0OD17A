MOSCOW, May 27 (Reuters) - Russian bank VTB <VTBR.MM> reported a 98 percent fall in net profit in the first three months of this year due to higher loan loss provisions following a deterioration in the Ukrainian and Russian economies.

VTB's first-quarter net profit fell to 400 million roubles ($12 million) from 15.7 billion in the same period of 2013. Analysts had forecast a profit of 12.9 billion roubles.
