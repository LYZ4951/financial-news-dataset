May 27 (Reuters) - In an escalation of China's dispute with the U.S. over spying claims, the Chinese government is pushing domestic banks to remove high-end servers made by International Business Machines Corp <IBM.N> and replace them with a local brand, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Government agencies, including the People's Bank of China [CNBNK.UL] and the Ministry of Finance, are reviewing whether Chinese commercial banks' reliance on the IBM servers compromises the country's financial security, the report said. (http://r.reuters.com/dyf69v) China on Monday accused the United States of "unscrupulous" cyber surveillance that included large-scale computer attacks against the Chinese government and Chinese companies. [ID:nL3N0OC2X4] China told its state-owned enterprises to sever links with American consulting firms just days after the United States charged five Chinese military officers with hacking U.S. companies, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. [ID:nL1N0OB0EK] The results of the government review will be submitted to a working group on Internet security chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping, Bloomberg reported.
