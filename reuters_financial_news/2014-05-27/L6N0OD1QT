WARSAW, May 27 (Reuters) - There is no threat of Poland sinking into deflation even though in the summer prices may fall for seasonal reasons, central bank deputy governor Andrzej Raczko was quoted as saying on Tuesday by state news agency PAP.

Earlier this month, central bank governor Marek Belka said he could not rule out the possibility of deflation. The bank targets an inflation rate of 2.5 percent, while in April prices rose by just 0.3 percent year-on-year. "When it comes to deflation understood as a process of a more long-term, seasonally adjusted kind associated with systematic persistent declines in the price level, I think that there is no threat of this type of phenomenon," Raczko was quoted by PAP as saying. Raczko also said that one can expect inflationary pressure from households, especially because of the still relatively high nominal wages growth. The bank's main interest rate [PLINTR=ECI] stands at 2.50 percent, an all-time low, and analysts expect that the Monetary Policy Council will keep them flat until early next year.
