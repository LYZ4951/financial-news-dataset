SYDNEY, May 28 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen starting off slightly firmer on Wednesday, supported by a rise in metals prices and yet another record-close for the S&P 500.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> edged up 0.1 percent, a 21.3-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark finished a choppy session flat on Tuesday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> added 0.3 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as the S&P 500 scored a second straight record close, buoyed by the latest round of merger activity and as expectations for rate cuts by the European Central Bank stoked investors' appetite for equities.  * Nickel was underpinned on Tuesday after rioting at a Vale mine in New Caledonia intensified worries over supply shortages, while copper hit its highest level in nearly three months on demand recovery hopes. Copper edged higher while Gold fell 2 percent. * Chinese steel and iron ore futures extended gains, steadying after steep price falls in recent weeks amid a pick-up in spot purchases of the raw material, although traders said the upside appears limited.  * Rio Tinto <RIO.L> <RIO.AX>, the world's second-largest diversified miner, said on Tuesday it had appointed an oil industry executive as the new head of its aluminium business, starting from June 1. [ID:nL6N0OD5SF] * Australia's approaching winter is likely to be warmer and drier than normal in many regions as climate models point to a developing El Niño  phenomenon, the Bureau of Meteorology said on Wednesday. [ID:nL3N0OD4EM] * Fonterra, the world's largest dairy exporter said that a significant rise in global dairy prices could trim demand for milk formula and other dairy products in China, its biggest customer. [ID:nL3N0OD4A5] * Firms linked to the construction sector may get a steer when the Australian Bureau of Statistics' quarterly report on construction is released later in the day.  ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2300 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1911.91   0.6%11.380 USD/JPY <JPY=>   101.96  -0.01%-0.010 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.5178  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1263.66  0.02% 0.270 US CRUDE<CLc1>   104.08  -0.03%-0.030 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16675.50 0.42% 69.23 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  144.87   0.25%  0.36 ------------------------------------------------------------- * S&P 500 ends at record on mergers, ECB; small caps rise [.N]   * Oil slips on profit taking but supported by Ukraine[O/R]   * Gold slips 2 pct on S&P rally, technicals; platinum falls[GOL/]   * Nickel firm on unrest at New Caledonia mine  [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB]   (Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471  4234) DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
