ANKARA, May 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday the Turkish central bank's interest rate cut last week was not enough and called for more "serious" decisions from the bank.

"A half percentage point (cut) is like mocking the nation. Instead, the decisions need to be serious," Erdogan told his weekly AK Party group meeting in parliament.
