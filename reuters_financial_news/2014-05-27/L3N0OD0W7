SINGAPORE, May 27 (Reuters) - Singapore shares eased on Tuesday, tracking losses in regional markets, led by Olam International Ltd <OLAM.SI> whose shares fell after a buyout offer from a Temasek-led group expired.

Olam shares fell 4.5 percent to an intra-day low of S$2.13. The losses led the Singapore index lower, with the benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> snapping three straight sessions of gains to fall 0.2 percent to 3,276.11. The drop followed similar declines in regional markets, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> down 0.2 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] State investor Temasek Holdings made an offer to buy all of Olam's shares in March, in what analysts said was a bid to take the company private. After the announcement, Olam shares shot up 11.8 percent to S$2.23, matching Temasek's offer price. [ID:nL3N0MB43G] That offer has now expired, with Temasek controlling around 80 percent of the company.  OCBC, which has a "sell" rating on the stock with a target price of S$1.87, said it did not expect the current share price to be supported around current levels with the expiry of the offer. Bucking the trend, shares of Noble Group Ltd <NOBG.SI> rose as much as 2.3 percent to hit a 1-1/2-year high of S$1.35, stretching gains into a third straight day. Among small caps, shares of oil production company RH Petrogas Ltd soared as much as 9.6 percent to hit a near 5-year high. The stock rose as much as 11 percent last Tuesday, prompting a query on trading activity from the Singapore bourse.
