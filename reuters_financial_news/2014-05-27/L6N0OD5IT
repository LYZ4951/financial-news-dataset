FRANKFURT, May 27 (Reuters) - German engineering company Siemens <SIEGn.DE> is ready to sell a 50 percent stake in household goods company BSH to private equity or rival Samsung if partner Bosch [ROBG.UL] does not agree to buy it soon, German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said.

Siemens has been keen to exit BSH Bosch Siemens Haushaltsgeraete, a joint venture  which makes vacuum cleaners, freezers, stoves and washing machines, since it undertook a strategic review, but Bosch has hesitated to buy, Frankfurter Allgemeine said, without citing sources. As a result, Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser is now ready to consider selling the stake to a third-party buyer, including rival Samsung <005930.KS> the paper added.  Siemens and Bosch both declined comment. BSH had annual revenue of 10.5 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in 2013.
