LISBON, May 27 (Reuters) - Portugal's second-largest listed bank Millennium bcp <BCP.LS> said on Tuesday it had repaid to the state 400 million euros in loans held in so-called contingent convertible bonds (CoCos) that have weighed on the bank's bottom line due to high interest charged.

Portugal's banks took the loans during the country's debt crisis and the financing was provided by the government as one part of Lisbon's 78-billion-euro bailout by the European Union and International Monetary Fund that ended this month.
