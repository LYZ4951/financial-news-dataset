EDINBURGH, May 27 (Reuters) - European shares edged higher on Tuesday, supported by hopes for more mergers and acquisitions activity that helped UK shares outperform mainland Europe.

Intercontinental Hotels Group <IHG.L> jumped 5.2 percent, the top performer on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>, buoyed by British media reports of bid interest from the United States. [ID:nL6N0OB0A9] The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.1 percent to 1,377.99 at 0713 GMT. UK shares gained 0.3 percent, ahead of bourses in the rest of Europe, following a public holiday on Monday when they missed out on the strong rise in European equities. On Monday, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> hit a record high and the euro zone Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> hit a new 5-1/2 year peak as showings by pro-European forces in Germany and Italy provided an antidote to Eurosceptic gains in France, the UK and Greece. However the UK market also saw Europe's biggest faller, with pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca dropping 1.7 percent after Pfizer <PFE.N> walked away from a proposed takeover.
