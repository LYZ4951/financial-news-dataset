PARIS, May 27 (Reuters) - Gaillon Invest, the investment vehicle of Chinese conglomerate Fosun <0656.HK> and French private equity firm Ardian, said on Tuesday it had no plan to raise its 17.50 euro ($23.89) per share takeover bid for Club Mediterrannee <CMIP.PA>.

"Gaillon Invest has no intention of raising its offer above the 17.50 euro price, which represents a good price given what they know about the company and the market," a Gaillon spokeswoman said.
