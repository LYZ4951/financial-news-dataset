HONG KONG, May 27 (Reuters) - China shares slipped on Tuesday, as there was a lack of catalysts to spur buying and recent signals from Beijing on policy fine-tuning to support economic growth failed to improve appetites for risk.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was off 0.3 percent at 2,034.57 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.4 percent. The NASDAQ-style ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mainly high-growth, high-tech counters, snapped a six-day winning streak and fell 0.7 percent. The index was 6.6 percent higher than May 16's lowest close this year.
