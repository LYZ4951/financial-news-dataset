OTTAWA, May 27 (Reuters) - Canada's economy and inflation are performing well, despite weak exports, which are expected to pick up, Finance Minister Joe Oliver said on Tuesday.

"Overall I think the economy is moving in the right direction. We're looking to a (budget) surplus next year. There've been over 1 million jobs created, and growth is moving at a reasonable pace, and inflation is certainly well within the target range," Oliver told reporters. He added the hope that exports would speed up as the global economy strengthens and in particular as the U.S. economy continues to grow.
