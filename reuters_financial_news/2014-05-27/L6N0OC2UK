MOSCOW, May 27 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest mobile phone operator MTS <MBT.N> said on Tuesday its first-quarter net profit was almost unchanged from the same year-ago period, slightly missing estimates.

The company reported a net profit of 13 billion roubles ($380 million) for the first three months of 2014 compared with 12.96 billion a year ago, while analysts had on average expected a profit of 13.5 billion roubles. [ID:nL6N0OC1HY]
