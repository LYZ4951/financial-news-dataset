SEOUL, May 27 (Reuters) - South Korean shares slipped to their lowest close in two weeks on Tuesday as a sell-off by domestic institutions outweighed foreign capital inflows, while the won <KRW=> eked out gains on demand from exporters.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> ended down 0.6 percent at 1,997.63 points, the weakest close since May 13. Institutional investors positioned as net sellers for a ninth straight session by offloading 109 billion won ($106.5 million) worth of KOSPI shares, while foreigners purchased a modest 22 billion won, extending their net buying streak to an 11th session. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,023.2 per dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.1 percent from Monday's close at 1,024.0.
