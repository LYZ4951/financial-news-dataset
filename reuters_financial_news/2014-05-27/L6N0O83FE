STOCKHOLM, May 27 (Reuters) - Swedish debt collector Intrum Justitia <IJ.ST> is again buying portfolios of delinquent debt in Spain and Italy after spending years on the sidelines during the recession, the company told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.

The economic downturn has left stacks of unpaid bills, which Intrum's debt purchasing unit is keen to buy from banks and credit card companies and then begin to collect. In 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, the company decided to focus its debt acquisitions on the Nordic region and Germany, Switzerland and Austria, but it now also invests elsewhere, Chief Executive Lars Wollung said. "We now begin a gradual return to a normal position where we look at all countries in Europe, from a more focused position where we only looked at a few," he told Reuters. "We have a more positive view on Europe as a whole and we think that the portfolio prices in many countries are at reasonable levels. Prices have come down and we also see stable cash flows in a lot of countries." During the first quarter of 2014 the company purchased debt in countries such as Italy, Spain, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Wollung revealed. "The market for portfolios is good at the moment, and there are a lot of portfolios for sale," he said, but declined to give a forecast for how much the company would spend in 2014. Last year Intrum bought portfolios for 2.5 billion Swedish crowns ($377.53 million), up from 2.0 billion in 2012, while they amounted to 688 million in the first quarter of 2014. "Seen over a period of several years, growth will be around 10 percent," Wollung said. Intrum targets a return on portfolio investments of 15 percent but has often tended to end up at a higher level, such as when it hit 21 percent in 2013. The strict return target sometimes forces the company to walk away empty handed from portfolio auctions. Asked if he'd be willing to lower the target, the CEO said he was constantly thinking of doing so but also added he was pleased with how well the company had performed during the financial crisis.
