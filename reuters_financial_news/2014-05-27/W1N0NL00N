May 27 (Reuters) - Three regional Federal Reserve banks whose chiefs are among the most hawkish U.S. central bankers continued to press last month for an increase in the Fed's emergency lending rate, minutes of deliberations released on Tuesday showed.

Directors of the Philadelphia, Kansas City and Dallas Fed banks wanted the so-called discount rate raised to 1.0 percent, in part because they felt current and expected economic conditions warranted returning the spread between it and the federal funds rate back to its pre-crisis level of 1 percentage point, the minutes said. The discount rate is what the Fed charges banks who turn to the central bank for funds when they are unable to raise them in the private market. The fed funds rate, which has been near zero since 2008, governs the cost of overnight borrowing between banks and is the Fed's main monetary policy lever. But the view of the nine other regional Fed banks, who wanted the discount rate kept at its current 0.75 percent level, carried the day ahead of the Fed's April 29-30 policy-setting meeting, the minutes showed.  Overall, most Fed bank directors "expressed positive views that the economy would continue to expand at a moderate pace," an upgrade from the prior month when they were reported to be "cautiously optimistic" about such a pickup after the winter's severe weather dealt a blow to growth.  Some directors reported increased construction activity and commercial lending, though they noted residential lending continued to slow. Spending was up, though unevenly across income levels, and while labor market indicators were "moderately encouraging" businesses were still cautious about hiring, and some directors reported difficulty finding qualified workers.
