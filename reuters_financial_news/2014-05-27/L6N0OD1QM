DUBLIN, May 27 (Reuters) - Ireland's state-run bad bank said on Tuesday it has completed 14.1 billion euros ($19 billion) of asset sales to date and expects to pay down a further 7.5 billion euros of debt this year.

The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), one of the world's largest property groups, has responded to a surge in demand for Irish real estate by speeding up its sales and has generated 3.5 billion euros so far this year.
