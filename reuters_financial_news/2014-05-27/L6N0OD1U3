LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian dollar bonds rose to six-week highs on Tuesday after a weekend election win for billionaire Petro Poroshenko who has signalled his intention to negotiate with Russia to try and end their recent tensions.

The 2020 bond <XS054378319=TE>, 2023 <XS091760584=TE> rose more than 1 point to six-week highs, according to data from Tradeweb.  London and New York, where the bonds are mostly traded, were shut on Monday meaning traders had to wait to respond to Poroshenko's win."The election result is not a big surprise but prices are up because the tail risk - fear the election would not go smoothly - is behind us now," said Societe Generale analyst Regis Chatellier.  "Also the IMF package will go through which will be a strong element of support."  International institutions have launched a multi-billion dollar aid package for Ukraine, conditional on reforms, effectively helping it avert default on its debt.
