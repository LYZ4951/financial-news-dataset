LISBON, May 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank BES <BES.LS> jumped 8 percent on Tuesday - the first day of trading in subscription rights for its ongoing cash call - after the main shareholder said it would keep a large 25 percent stake in BES.

"People are buying the rights, which allows the shares to rise on arbitrage deals," said Paulo Rosa, a trader with Go Bulling brokers in Porto, adding though that the true appetite for the cash call was hard to fathom with six days of rights trading left. Earlier, Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESF.LS>, the largest shareholder in BES, said it will end up with a stake of 25 percent after the rights issue, only slightly smaller than its current 27.4 percent holding. [ID:nL6N0OD1R4] "The reduction of ESFG's stake is not as big as expected, which means that the selling pressure on the rights that some expected is not there," Albino Oliveira, an analyst at Fincor brokers in Lisbon.
