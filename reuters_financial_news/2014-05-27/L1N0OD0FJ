May 27 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc <AGN.N> said on Tuesday Valeant Pharmaceuticals International's <VRX.TO> $47 billion offer overstated the possible savings from the deal in terms of both research and development and in tax structure.

In slides available on its web site that it says were reviewed by Alvarez & Marsal and FTI Consulting, the botox maker detailed its argument for rejecting Valeant's offer. Valeant and activist investor Bill Ackman made an offer to buy Allergan on April 22, which Allergan spurned. Allergan said Valeant's low organic sales growth was driven by price increases, that its acquired companies experienced market share erosion and that Valeant lacked transparency in its financial reporting.
