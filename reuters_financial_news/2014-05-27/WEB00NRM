PARIS, May 27 (Reuters) - General Electric <GE.N> will make precise commitments to increase jobs in France as part of its efforts to seal a deal to buy Alstom's <ALSO.PA> power arm, GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on Tuesday.

During a hearing about GE's 12.35 billion euro ($16.9 billion) bid for Alstom's power business, Immelt also said his group was considering a tie-up in rail signaling that would give the French engineering group control of that business.
