HANOI, May 27 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.49 percent by the mid-day break on Tuesday, led by gains in banking stocks.

Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, Vietnam's biggest lender by market capitalisation, was up 1.83 percent, and Hanoi-based BIDV <BID.HM> also gained 1.37 percent. "Foreign investors, who are mostly institutions, trade on value of stocks, so falling share prices are seen as investment opportunities," said Deputy General Director Trinh Hoai Giang of Ho Chi Minh City Securities. Foreign investors in May have so far bought net 1.7 trillion dong ($80.4 million) worth of Vietnamese equities as of Monday, the largest monthly level since the beginning of the year, exchange's data showed. But trade is likely to be weak in coming sessions, given the risk of rising tension between Vietnam and China over an ongoing dispute in the South China Sea, analysts said.
