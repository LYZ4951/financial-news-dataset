TORONTO, May 27 (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia <BNS.TO> said on Tuesday its second-quarter profit rose 14 percent, due largely to higher income at its domestic banking and global wealth management units.

Scotiabank, Canada's No. 3 bank, earned a net C$1.80 billion ($1.66 billion), or C$1.39 a share, in the second quarter ended April 30, compared with C$1.58 billion, or C$1.22 a share, a year earlier.
