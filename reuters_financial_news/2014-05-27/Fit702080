May 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Commonwealth Bank of  Australia's <CBA.AX> (CBA, AA-/Stable/F1+) Series 35 issue of AUD125m mortgage-covered  bonds a rating of 'AAA'. The Outlook is Stable. The fixed-rate bond is due in  May 2024 and benefits from a 12-month extendable maturity.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on CBA's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', a  Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 2 (high), and an asset percentage (AP) of 89.5%,  which is equivalent to Fitch's breakeven AP for a 'AAA' rating, supporting a  'AA' rating on a probability of default (PD) basis, and a 'AAA' rating after  giving credit for recoveries. The Outlook on the covered bonds reflects the  Stable Outlook on CBA's IDR.  Maturity mismatches are significant, with the weighted-average residual life of  the cover assets at 15.4 years, and the liabilities at 5.1 years.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
