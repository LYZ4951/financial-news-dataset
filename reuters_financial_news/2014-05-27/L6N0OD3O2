ACCRA, May 27 (Reuters) - Ghana has cancelled plans to issue a seven-year domestic bond worth 100 million cedis ($33.4 million) this month to a avoid spike in already high bond yields, government officials and analysts said on Tuesday.

The central bank in January announced plans to issue a series of short- and medium-term papers including a third seven-year bond slated for this month as part of government debt restructuring.
