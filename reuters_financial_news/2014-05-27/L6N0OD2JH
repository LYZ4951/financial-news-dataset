AMSTERDAM, May 27 (Reuters) - A team of experts investigating alleged chlorine attacks in Syria for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came under attack on Tuesday but all members of the team were safe and were returning to base, the organisation said in a statement.

"A convoy of OPCW inspectors and United Nations staff that was travelling to a site of an alleged chlorine gas attack in Syria came under attack this morning," the global chemical weapons watchdog said.
