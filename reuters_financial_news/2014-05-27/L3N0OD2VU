May 27 (Reuters) - Aeropostale Inc <ARO.N> said it secured a $150 million credit facility from private equity firm Sycamore Partners, in what could be a lifeline for the struggling teen apparel retailer.

Shares of Aeropostale, which reported its sixth straight quarterly loss last week, rose 8.5 percent to $3.70 in premarket trading.  The company had announced the deal in March. [ID:nPn1FpqcP] Aeropostale said it issued convertible preferred stock to Sycamore, giving it the right to acquire up to a 5 percent stake at an exercise price of $7.25, the closing of the retailer's stock on March 12. [ID:nPn69Kq0T] Sycamore had a 7.96 percent stake in Aeropostale as of March 13. Last week, Aeropostale also forecast a bigger-than-expected loss for the current quarter as it struggles to keep pace with changing fashion trends. [ID:nL3N0O84YE] Analysts at Morgan Stanley warned that the company could raise going concern doubts as soon as next year as it burns up cash amid mounting losses. [ID:nL3N0O93X0] Aeropostale appointed former chief executive Julian Geiger and Sycamore Managing Director Stefan Kaluzny to its board, the company said on Tuesday.  Aeropostale also said it would nominate Kenneth Gilman, a director at jeweler Zale Corp <ZLC.N> and handbags retailer Kate Spade & Co <KATE.N>, for election as an independent director at its annual stockholder meeting this year.
