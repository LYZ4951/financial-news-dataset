Dec 7 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse AG <CSGN.VX> is considering scaling down its prime brokerage business as part of already announced efforts to reduce risk in its investment banking division, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Credit Suisse like many investment banks is reconciling its ambitions with increased regulation.  An expert panel on Friday recommended that the Swiss government require UBS <UBSG.VX> and Credit Suisse be subject to a higher leverage ratio.

[ID:nL5N0IE0AN] "The prime brokerage business is indeed part of the risk reduction exercise announced earlier," the person familiar with the matter said. The Financial Times first reported Credit Suisse was planning to shrink its prime brokerage business. The bank aims to have businesses in its investment bank with top-three market positions that can earn a healthy return on capital, and in the past has chosen to exit or scale-back in many of the areas which did not meet the criteria, such as commodities.
