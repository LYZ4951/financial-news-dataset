ISTANBUL, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Turkey has told three unnamed banks to "cooperate" in its fight against financing terrorism and in identifying dirty money, Turkey's state news agency said on Sunday.

"There are three banks that do not cooperate with the Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) efficiently in the detection of dirty money and in the fight against terrorism. We have warned them," Finance Minister Ahmet Simsek was quoted as telling the Anadolu news agency, adding that he was unable to name the banks because of privacy concerns. "We have warned them and now we expect them to build much more effective cooperation with us. They considered our earlier warnings, and I am sure they will cooperate more now," he added. Last year Turkey's parliament approved a long-awaited anti-terrorism financing law, which allows alleged "terrorist" accounts to be frozen without a court order and provides for a variety of penalties including imprisonment for those found to be abetting terrorism.
