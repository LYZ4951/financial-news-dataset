FRANKFURT, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Lufthansa's <LHAG.DE> supervisory board has blocked management plans to issue a convertible bond to fund the purchase of more planes, German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Sunday, without citing sources.

The plans would have seen Germany's biggest airline issuing a convertible bond of about half a billion euros, the magazine said, adding subscribers could have chosen after three years whether to get back their investment in cash plus interest or in Lufthansa stock. Lufthansa -- which will present its new return on capital key performance indicator (KPI) and new dividend policy on Dec. 11 -- declined to comment on the report, adding supervisory board meetings were confidential.
