STOCKHOLM, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Private equity firms Apax and Nordic Capital are looking to list Swedish health care company Capio soon, possibly during the first quarter next year, Swedish business daily Dagens Industri reported on Sunday, citing sources.

The paper said SEB and JP Morgan were leading advisers in the plans for a new listing in Stockholm.  In April, Dagens Industri cited sources saying the private equity companies had hired advisers ahead of a listing that was then likely in the fall this year. [ID:nL6N0NH52M] Capio's Chief Executive Officer Thomas Berglund told the paper there was no timetable although the current owners would of course pass over ownership at some point and that he thought it "may be good" for the company to move to the stock exchange in the future.
