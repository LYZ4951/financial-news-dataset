MILAN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - UniCredit <CRDI.MI> has started exclusive talks with a consortium comprising U.S. Fortress Investment Group <FIG.N> and Italy's Prelios <PCRE.MI> to sell debt recovery unit UCCMB, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Friday.

The sale, which could raise more than 600 million euros ($760 million), would be the biggest transaction on distressed debt signed in Italy for several years after other Italian lenders scrapped similar deals some months ago.
