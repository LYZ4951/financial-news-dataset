Oct 23 (Reuters) - E-commerce services provider Digital River Inc <DRIV.O> said on Thursday it entered into an agreement to be acquired by an investor group led by Siris Capital Group LLC for about $840 million.

The deal, valued at $26 per share in cash, is at a premium of almost 50 percent of Digital River's Thursday's closing price. The agreement, approved by the board of Minnesota-based Digital River, includes a 45-day "go-shop" period during which the company can solicit alternative proposals, Digital River said on Thursday. [ID:nBwb7gBgya] Siris will finance the deal with a combination of equity and debt, for which it has secured financing. The companies expect the deal to close in the first quarter of 2015.
