FRANKFURT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> passed the stress test led by the European Central Bank by a wide margin with a core equity ratio of 8.8 percent compared to a minimum requirement of 5.5 percent, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.

In the preliminary test results, Germany's flagship bank also posted a common equity tier one ratio of 12.6 percent in the so-called baseline scenario, meant to model economic conditions with mild growth, the sources said. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
