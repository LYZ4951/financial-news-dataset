MILAN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> were lower in opening trade on Friday after reports that European banks stress tests would find a capital shortfall at the mid-size Italian lender.

"Ahead of the stress test results some investors are covering themselves and are prefering to sell Carige," a Milan trader said. An unsourced report in Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said on Friday Banca Carige could be one of the Italian banks that will be asked to take measures to cover a capital shortfall that could emerged from the European Central Bank's health checks on the sector. [ID:nL6N0SI3TM] The results of the ECB's review will be released on Sunday.
