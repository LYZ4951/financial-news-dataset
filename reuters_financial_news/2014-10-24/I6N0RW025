MILAN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena's <BMPS.MI> shares were sharply higher on Friday as traders said the bailed-out Italian lender could pass the banks health checks of the European Central Bank with few problems.

"Investors are betting that one of the most problematic banks in the euro zone could pass the stress tests with fewer problems than previously thought," said Vincenzo Longo, strategist at broker house IG. Shares in the world's oldest bank have come under pressure in recent days as many analysts see it at risk of failing the test, despite raising 5 billion euros from shareholders in June to strengthen its finances. At 0830 GMT Monte paschi shares were up 8 percent at 0.9770 euros.
