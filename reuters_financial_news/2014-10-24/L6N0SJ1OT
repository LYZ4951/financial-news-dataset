WARSAW, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Bank Millennium <MILP.WA>, a Polish unit of Portugal's Millennium BCP <BCP.LS>, reported a 24-percent growth in its third-quarter net profit, the lender said on Friday.

This was broadly in line with analysts' expectations, who put the growth down mostly to the bank's rising net interest income.  Bank Millennium, the first Polish lender to present its results for the July-September period, showed a bottom line of 173 million zlotys ($52 million), compared to 170 million seen in a Reuters poll.
