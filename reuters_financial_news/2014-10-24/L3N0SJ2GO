SEOUL, Oct 24 (Reuters) - South Korean shares reversed early gains to edge lower on Friday, after the market was spooked by reports that a doctor who returned to New York City from West Africa has tested positive for Ebola.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> shed 0.31 percent to close at 1,925.69, wrapping up the trading week with a 1.3 percent gain from last Friday. The South Korean won <KRW=> was a shade lower against the dollar as the greenback found support from upbeat U.S economic data, although falls were limited following the Ebola scare in New York City.
