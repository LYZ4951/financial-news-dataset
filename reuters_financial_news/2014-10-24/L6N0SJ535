MILAN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Italian eco-leather and special paper maker Favini said it had postponed plans to list its shares on the Milan bourse due to unfavourable market conditions.

Financial market turmoil has led a string of companies across Europe to rethink their plans for initial public offerings (IPO).  Favini, whose roots date back to 1736 when its owners converted a mill in Italy's Veneto region into a paper factory,  said on Friday it still wanted to list but would do so when market conditions improved. The company confirmed its plans to grow. The listing was intended to bring resources to help fund its expansion in the luxury and fashion markets. New share issues in Europe quadrupled year on year in the first nine months of this year to a total of $55.5 billion, and some analysts say the market has become saturated.  Favini, which had gross revenue of 161.9 million euros ($205 million) last year, is 62 percent owned by Luxembourg-based fund OI-Paper. France's Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> owns 21 percent, while 13 percent is held by holding company Lacim and 4 percent by Favini's management.
