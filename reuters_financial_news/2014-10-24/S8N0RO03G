MADRID, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Caixabank <CABK.MC> on Friday posted a 1.6 percent rise in nine-month net profit from a year ago, at 466 million euros ($589.77 million), just missing a 474 million euros forecast in a Reuters poll of six analysts.

Spain's third-biggest bank also said its net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus funding costs, was up 4.7 percent in the period, at 3.07 billion euros, also in line with forecasts.
