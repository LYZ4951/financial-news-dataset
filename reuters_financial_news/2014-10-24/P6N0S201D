PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - European shares fell in early trading on Friday, reversing the previous session's gains, as investors fretted about news that a doctor who had recently returned to New York from West Africa had tested positive for Ebola.

At 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent at 1,310.25 points.
