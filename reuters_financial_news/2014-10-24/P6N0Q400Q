PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The results of an extensive review of euro zone banks' finances due to be published at the weekend will restore credibility in the sector, Bank of France governor Christian Noyer said on Friday.

"I am waiting for (the results) in serenity. We are going to show that it was an exercise that was very complete and extremely rigourous, more rigourous than what was done in other big countries," Noyer, a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, said on RTL radio. "And I think it will give credibility to the strength of the euro zone banking system," he added.
