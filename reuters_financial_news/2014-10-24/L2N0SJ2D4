MEXICO CITY, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady next Friday and argue that a recent spike in inflation will fade next year.

Fifteen analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the central bank to hold its main interest rate <MXCBIR=ECI> at 3.00 percent on Oct. 31 while one analyst expected a 25 basis point cut after weak growth in the third quarter. [ID:nL2N0SJ0VB]  Policymakers held the rate steady at July and September meetings after catching markets off guard with a 50 basis points cut in June to aid a sluggish economy. Mexican inflation hit a 9-month high of 4.32 percent in early October, above the bank's 4 percent ceiling, but policymakers expect inflation will fall toward their 3 percent target early next year as the effect of tax hikes fade.
