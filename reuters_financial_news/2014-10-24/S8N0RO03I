MADRID, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Spanish nationalised lender Bankia <BKIA.MC> on Friday reported a 93-percent surge in net profit in the nine months to Sept. 30 from a year ago, boosted by cost-cutting, capital gains from stake sales and lower provisions as bad loans came down.

Net profit was 698 million euros ($883.53 million) in the period, beating the 673 million euros forecast in a Reuters poll of five analysts.
