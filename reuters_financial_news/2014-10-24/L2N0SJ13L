NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Managers are rushing to bring new collateralized loan obligation (CLO) funds to the US market despite higher volatility and are taking advantage of lower secondary loan prices and cheaper transaction structuring costs to stock up new vehicles before looming risk retention rules mean require them to hold part of each new fund created.

US CLO volume is on track for a record year. Volume of just under $100 billion has already passed last year's $81 billion, and is set to easily outpace the record $101 billion seen in 2007.  Despite a spike in volatility in the week ending October 17, investors snapped up $2.9 billion of CLOs, bringing the total of CLOs sold in October so far to $8.4 billion. The CLO market saw double digit volume each month from March to August.  Some managers and investors are, however, expecting new CLO activity to fall as a result of the risk retention rules, which require managers to keep 'skin in the game' by holding 5 percent of the fair value of CLO liabilities and if leveraged credit markets slow further.  "We may be in the early stages of a slowdown in the rate of new CLO formation," said John Wright, head of structured credit at Sankaty Advisors.  As volatility increased, dealers circulated lists of portfolios of more than $200 million of CLO debt tranches seeking bids. The debt tranches did not sell despite attracting investor interest and were used as a pricing exercise to gauge the value of the often illiquid securities. Spreads were affected by the volatility but sparse trading showed an absence of panic selling, traders said.  Spreads across the CLO debt spectrum widened by 3-15bp in October in line with the seniority of credit rating, according to JP Morgan research. Spreads are 7-113bp higher across the most senior to junior tranches for the year.  New CLO launches have not been derailed by higher funding costs, as these have been offset by a wider variety of discounted loans to buy. Average loan prices fell from a January high of 99.34 to a 52-week low of 98.15 in mid October, according to Thomson Reuters SMi data. Cheaper loan collateral boosts cash yields and provides more room for loan portfolio appreciation.  "CLO equity economics still work at current market levels and credit fundamentals remain solid despite lower loan prices," said John Fraser, managing partner at 3i Debt Management.  Some CLO arrangers and managers have cut fees to increase expected returns and make sure that pipeline deals launch, a CLO banker said. With volume of just under $100 billion in the year to date, CLO origination desks have made enough money to be able to offer some concessions, he said.  Volatility has, however, prompted some banks to reduce warehouse financing arrangements that back the creation of new CLOs before the end of the year, an investor said. The slump in secondary loan prices is worrying banks that are providing the warehouse financing that CLO managers use to buy assets to put in new vehicles.
