SHANGHAI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished lower on Friday, dragged down by weak Chinese property data and corporate results from major companies.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> unofficially closed down 0.1 percent at 23,302.20 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 0.5 percent. For the week, the two indexes were up 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, posting the biggest weekly gains since early September.  Property shares fell following a fifth straight month of declines in home prices in China in September and the prospect of a greater supply of flats in Hong Kong as the government tries to rein in prices.
