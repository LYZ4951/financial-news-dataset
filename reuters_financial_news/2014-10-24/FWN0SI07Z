FRANKFURT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank on Friday said it expected to publish litigation costs of 894 million euros ($1.13 billion) for the third quarter of 2014. The costs are for a number of items and are mostly not tax-deductible, the bank said in a statement.

Earlier on Friday, sources told Reuters that Deutsche was bracing to pay almost 1 billion euros ($1.3 bln) for Libor-related fines as it nears a deal with U.S. and UK authorities to settle allegations it attempted to manipulate the benchmark interest rate. [ID:nL6N0SJ3D7]
