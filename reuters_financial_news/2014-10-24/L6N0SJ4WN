DUBLIN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - European bank stress tests have found that Ireland's permanent tsb (PTSB) <IPM.I> had a capital shortfall of 800 million to 850 million euros at the end of 2013, a source familiar with the process said on Friday.

The shortfall will drop to around 200 million euros ($253 million) after taking into account the bank's financial actions so far this year plus the potential conversion of 400 million euros of contingent capital notes, known as CoCo bonds, the source added.
