LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Sterling rose to the day's high against the dollar on Friday, after data showed the British economy expanding in line with expectations in the third quarter and wrong-footing some who had positioned for a softer reading.    Gross domestic product expanded by 0.7 percent in the July-September period, compared with 0.9 percent in the second quarter. Growth slowed as services output growth eased and manufacturing expanded at its weakest pace in 18 months. <ECONGB>

Sterling <GBP=D4> rose 0.15 percent to $1.6056 from around $1.6032 beforehand. The euro edged lower to 78.82 pence <EURGBP=D4>, down from 78.90 pence before the data was released.
