LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - New British bank TSB <TSB.L> said it was picking up nearly one in ten of all new current accounts being opened in the UK and reported a 29 percent increase in third-quarter profit.

TSB, Britain's seventh biggest lender after being spun out from Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> in June, said its pretax profit rose to 33.1 million pounds ($53 million). TSB was carved out from Lloyds under orders from European regulators as a condition of Lloyds' taxpayer-funded bailout during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009.
