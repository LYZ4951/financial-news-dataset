LAURA, Russia, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Russia intends to continue moves to a floating exchange rate and will not "burn" through its foreign exchange reserves, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.

"We will gradually move to a floating exchange rate. We will not burn our reserves thoughtlessly. We will use them for a certain balancing," Putin told a meeting with Russian and foreign experts on Russia.
