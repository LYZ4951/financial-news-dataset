Oct 24 (Reuters) - Speculative net short positions in Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Eurodollar futures fell to 718,781 contracts in the latest week to their lowest since December, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.

A week ago, speculative net shorts on CME futures on what banks charge each other to borrow dollars were 915,783 contracts. [ID:nEMN403J78] Speculators have been reducing their bearish bets on Eurodollar futures as data suggesting slowing global economic growth caused a shift in expectations on the timing that the U.S. Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates. On Oct. 15, there was a massive exit of short bets in the Eurodollar and Treasury futures. Short-term rate futures implied traders now see the central bank likely raising rates at the end of 2015. A month ago, they had signaled traders were pricing a rate hike in mid-2015. Over the past six weeks, speculators have reduced their net short Eurodollar positions by 1.17 mln contracts, which was the biggest net change on record over a comparable period.
