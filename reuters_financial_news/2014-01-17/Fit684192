Jan 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed AllianceBernstein Emerging Market Debt (EMD) fund's 'Excellent' rating. The fund is managed by AllianceBernstein L.P. [AXAFA.UL] AllianceBernstein EMD benefits from a robust and well balanced investment  process that combines the independent inputs of credit and macro-economic  research in a disciplined and formalised approach. The fund benefits from the  depth of AllianceBernstein's fixed income and support resources, and from a  robust IT platform.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Fund Presentation Launched in March 2006, AllianceBernstein EMD is a Luxemburg domiciled fund with  USD808m of assets as of end-December 2013, investing in dollar- and local  currency-denominated emerging market (EM) sovereign, quasi sovereign, corporate  debt, currencies and derivatives.   Investment Process The fund's primarily bottom-up, investment process combines the independent  inputs of fundamental and quantitative research in a disciplined approach, while  allowing portfolio managers (PM) sufficient flexibility in the diversification  of sources of risks and returns. Economic, credit and quantitative research are  conducted by independent teams. Research recommendations are challenged in  formal review meetings and a consensus is sought on portfolio investment  decisions.  Resources The fund benefits from the depth of AB's resources, including the nine-strong,  largely, EMD team, led by Paul DeNoon, the fund's PM. The team is supported by  four dedicated economists, part of an economic team of nine, 35 credit research  analysts, a quant research team of eight and a fixed income trading desk of 20.  Over the past 18 months, AB has increased its capabilities in EM corporate  research, in line with market developments and the fund's allocation. The IT  platform is built around integrated proprietary and third party systems and risk  analytics.  Track Record The AllianceBernstein EMD fund has consistently outperformed the Lipper category  "Bond Emerging Market Global Hard Currency". The strong track record is  illustrated by a Lipper Leader of four (second highest quintile) over five years  and three over three years. Over the past five years, the fund returned 85.7%,  outperforming its benchmark (JP Morgan EMBI - Global) and Lipper category by  13.3% and 21.3% respectively (second quintile performance). Last year proved to  be challenging, as the fund's performance was fourth quintile in its Lipper  category.  Asset Manager AllianceBernstein, L.P., rated 'A+'/Stable/'F1' is a diversified asset manager  (USD451bn assets under management as at end-December 2013). AB has been  investing in emerging market debt since the early 1990s. AB managed USD27bn in  emerging market debt strategies as at end-September 2013.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the investment or operational  processes, or resources dedicated to the fund. A material adverse deviation from  Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could result in a downgrade of the  rating. For example, this may be manifested in significant structural  deterioration in the fund's performance relative to its benchmark and peers.  Fitch would take action if long term risk-adjusted performance relative to  peers, as indicated by Lipper scores, continues to deteriorate. Key man risk is  limited given the depth of the credit team and the process-driven investment  approach.   Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings combine Fitch's experience in qualitative fund  analysis with rankings and performance data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters  company. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings offer an independent, forward-looking  assessment of a fund's key performance and risk attributes and consistency of  longer-term returns, relative to peer group or benchmarks. The ratings focus on  the fund manager's investment process, key fund performance drivers, risk  management, and the quality of the fund's operational infrastructure.
