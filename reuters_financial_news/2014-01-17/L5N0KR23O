COPENHAGEN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Issuance of corporate bonds by non-financial companies in Denmark could double this year to more than 10 billion Danish crowns ($1.82 billion), the head of Danske Bank's <DANSKE.CO> credit research said on Friday.

Companies outside Denmark's banking and financial services sector have issued little in the way of corporate debt in recent years though issuance has been rising. Before the crisis of 2008-2009, bank lending was easy to get hold of and after, investors' risk appetite has been low. Danske Bank now sees a growing interest from investors who are looking for higher-yielding assets while companies are looking to diversify their funding in an environment where bank lending remains constrained.   "For companies excluding banks, we believe that we can reach a market of double-digit billions of Danish crowns in 2014 for the entire Danish market," Danske Bank Head of Credit Research Thomas Hovard said.  Hovard confirmed Danske Bank is in talks with possible first-time issuers outside the financial sector, but refused to disclose any names. Corporate bond issuance by non-financial companies was around 5 billion Danish crowns ($911.39 million) in 2013, the highest level since 2004. Among issuers last year was Danish healthcare product maker Ambu <AMBUb.CO>, with a market cap of 3 billion crowns, which issued corporate bonds worth 700 million crowns.
