LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Sterling rose strongly while gilts fell on Friday after British retailers reported their fastest sales growth in more than nine years, adding weight to the view that a resurgent UK economy may bring forward an interest rate rise.

The pound, which has been weak since the start of the year, was last up 0.5 percent to $1.6439 <GBP=D4>, having traded at $1.6344 before the data. The euro was 0.7 percent lower at 82.68 pence <EURGBP=D4>, having been at 83.21 pence beforehand. British retail sales jumped by 2.6 percent in December to show an annual rise in volumes of 5.3 percent, the fastest growth since October 2004, official data showed on Friday. [ID:nL9N0FN02R]  UK gilt futures <FLGcv1> erased gains after the data to stand 19 ticks lower at 108.75.  They fell to a session low of 108.70, having stood at 109.10 before the data release.
