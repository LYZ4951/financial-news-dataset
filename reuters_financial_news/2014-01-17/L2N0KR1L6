WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators told Dutch bank Rabobank <RABN.UL> to fix problems with its anti-money laundering programs last month after identifying compliance issues in an order made public on Friday.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) entered into a consent order with Rabobank in December. The U.S. bank regulator included the order in a list of recent enforcement actions that was published on Friday. Rabobank, which has many California locations, was fined $1 billion by U.S. and European regulators last year for rigging benchmark interest rates. Several top executives stepped down, and three former traders were criminally charged this week. [ID:nL2N0KN268] The OCC order does not include any penalties.  U.S. regulators have made anti-money laundering efforts a priority in recent years and have required nearly every major financial institution to improve its policing of illicit activity by customers. JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> agreed last week to improve its compliance after it was forced to pay $2 billion to U.S. authorities over issues related to its relationship with Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff. [ID:nL2N0KI2GE] The OCC directed Rabobank to appoint a compliance committee and detail the steps needed to fix its anti-money laundering program, for review by U.S. regulators.  It also must conduct an assessment to determine locations and products that pose anti-money laundering risk to the bank, the OCC said.
