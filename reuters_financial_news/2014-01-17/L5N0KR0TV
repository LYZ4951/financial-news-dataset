JOHANNESBURG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Shares in South African retailers Shoprite <SHPJ.J> and Truworths <TRUJ.J> fell on Friday after their latest sales figures disappointed investors, rekindling concerns about the prospects for some of Johannesburg's most expensive stocks.

Retailers in Africa's biggest economy are struggling with lacklustre consumer spending due to slow growth and high levels of household debt and analysts see little immediate upside for the sector given the high valuations. Shoprite, a grocer that also has operations in Nigeria and Zambia, said on Friday sales increased by 9.6 percent in the six months to end-December. Comparable store sales were up 4.3 percent. Its shares slid nearly 4 percent to 152.61 rand. Even after a 19 percent slide last year, Shoprite is still trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 24, making it one of the ten most expensive stocks on the benchmark Top-40 index <.JTOPI>. Clothing retailer Truworths reported a more than 50 percent fall in first-half sales growth after the market closed on Thursday, to 7 percent. Comparable store sales increased by just 1 percent. HSBC cut its target price on the stock by nearly 11 percent, to 74 rand, citing "strategic concerns around pricing architecture against product relevance." Its shares dropped 2.2 percent to 76.25 rand. Separately, clothing and furniture retailer Foschini Group <TFGJ.J> said its 9-month sales to Dec. 28 increased 9 percent, with comparable store sales rising by 4 percent. Foschini shares were little changed at 96.34 rand at 0844 GMT. Official data on Wednesday showed industry-wide retail sales grew at 4.2 percent in November, year-on-year, far outstripping the 1 percent economists had expected. [ID:nJ8N0J3025]
