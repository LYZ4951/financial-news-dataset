ROME, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Italy's economy is likely to have grown marginally in the fourth quarter of last year for the first time since mid-2011 and a slow recovery can be expected in 2014 and 2015, the Bank of Italy said on Friday.

In its latest quarterly bulletin the central bank said the euro zone's third largest economy probably contracted by 1.8 percent in 2013, marginally raising its July projection of -1.9 percent, and would grow 0.7 percent this year. "Economic activity appears to have returned to modest expansion in the fourth quarter," the bulletin said, citing a recent improvement in industrial production but warning that consumer spending remained weak. The economy stagnated in the third quarter, supported by exports and stock-building, after eight consecutive quarterly declines. This year should see growth of 0.7 percent, strengthening to 1.0 percent in 2015, with the gradual recovery "driven by the expansion of world trade and an albeit modest upturn in investments." The bank's 0.7 percent forecast for this year confirmed its July estimate, while the 2015 forecast was issued for the first time. The forecasts for this year and next were subject to considerable uncertainty and carried predominantly downside risks connected to still weak credit conditions and fragile prospects for a recovery in investment, the bulletin said.  The Bank of Italy's forecasts have consistently been too optimistic on Italy's economic performance in recent years, as the country has languished in its longest post-war recession. Enrico Letta's coalition government forecasts a stronger recovery this year, with growth of 1.1 percent, rising to 1.7 percent in 2015. Those forecasts, drawn up by Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni, a former Bank of Italy deputy governor, are far more upbeat than those of virtually all independent forecasters. The median forecast of a Reuters' survey of around 20 economists this week pointed to 2014 growth of just 0.4 percent [ID:nL6N0KO1NC]. The bulletin said there were signs of a pick-up in foreigners' interest in Italian financial assets and in the third quarter of last year bad loans stopped growing for the first time since the middle of 2011. However, bank credit to the private sector was continuing to contract, the bank said.
