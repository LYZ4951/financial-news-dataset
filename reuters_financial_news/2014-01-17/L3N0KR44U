HONG KONG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China diaper maker AAB Group, backed by Asia private equity firm RRJ Capital, is seeking to raise up to $300 million in a Hong Kong stock market listing, IFR reported on Friday.

AAB, which is expected to benefit from a relaxation in China's one-child policy, plans to list the company as early as the first quarter, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, said. The relaxation in Zhejiang province came into effect on Friday, and allows couples to have a second child if just one of the parents is an only child, IFR said.  RRJ Capital, founded by former Goldman Sachs <GS.N> banker and Hopu dealmaker Richard Ong, invested $80 million in AAB in 2011 with Hong Kong listed CK Life Sciences International Holdings Ltd <0775.HK>.  The private equity firm could make three to four times its initial investment, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Bank of America <BAC.N>, RaffAello Capital and UBS AG <UBSN.VX> are managing the share listing, IFR said.
