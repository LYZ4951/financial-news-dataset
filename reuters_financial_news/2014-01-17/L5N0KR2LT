PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday in brisk volumes, extending their new-year rally as expectations of a pick up in global growth prompted investors to buy into cyclical mining stocks.

Miners were the biggest contributors to Friday's rally in Europe, with Glencore Xstrata <GLEN.L> up 3.3 percent and Lonmin <LMI.L> up 2.5 percent. Rio Tinto <RIO.L>, which on Thursday reported big production increases, gained 0.9 percent.  The basic resources sector <.SXPP> - hammered in 2013 when it dropped 14 percent - has surged 6.7 percent so far this week, its best weekly gain in two years, propelled by hopes of an acceleration in the world's economy. At 1537 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top  European shares was up 0.5 percent at 1,343.64 points, a level not seen in 5-1/2 year high. "We're getting the confirmation that developed economies are turning the corner, which should logically translate into a rebound in corporate profits this year," Barclays France director Franklin Pichard said. "Looking ahead, investors should see every pull-back on the market as buying opportunities." Bucking the trend on Friday, oil major Royal Dutch Shell <RDSb.L> fell 1.9 percent after warning fourth-quarter figures would be significantly lower than recent levels of profitability. [ID:nL5N0KR0H3] Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> was up 0.1 percent, Germany's DAX index <.GDAXI> up 0.3 percent, and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> up 0.2 percent. Peripheral markets also gained ground, extending their brisk rally since the start of the year, with Italy's FTMIB <.FTMIB> up 0.5 percent, Portugal's PSI 20 <.PSI20> up 0.4 percent and Spain's IBEX <.IBEX> up 0.1 percent. So far in 2014, the MIB is up 5.2 percent, the PSI 20 up 8.5 percent and the IBEX up 5.5 percent, strongly outperforming a 2.1 percent gain by the broad FTSEurofirst 300. "European indexes have entered a new phase of bull market," Aurel BGC chartist Gerard Sagnier said. "The buying pressure is strong, while the pull-backs are shallow. There's a nice upside potential for 2014." A pick-up in the euro zone's macro indicators and a more dovish European Central Bank have prompted investors to scoop up European shares in the past few months, and the trend has extended into the new year. Investment inflows from U.S. investors into European equities accelerated in the second week of 2014, Thomson Reuters Lipper data shows, signalling further investor appetite for Europe after last year's record inflows into the region.
