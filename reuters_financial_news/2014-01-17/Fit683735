Jan 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that Russia's provision of external financing and cheaper gas supplies to Ukraine significantly reduces the risk of a sovereign external liquidity crisis in 2014. However, it also allows Ukraine to continue to run unsustainable fiscal and external deficits, building up public and external debt, and creates a hump in  debt repayments in 2016. Ukraine received the first USD3bn tranche of a promised USD15bn in Russian  financing on 24 December 2013 and plans to place a further USD12bn in Eurobonds  by end-2014. The schedule and amount of borrowing is still being discussed. If  realised, this would be more than sufficient to refinance USD6.7bn in sovereign  external debt repayments in 2014, although the government will still need to  borrow elsewhere to finance a widening fiscal deficit of up to 7% of GDP. Ukraine's external financing position remains fragile. The current account  deficit (CAD) widened to around 8.6% of GDP in 2013. Lower gas prices could be  worth 2% of GDP to the current account, and will reduce the import bill, but  Fitch expects looser fiscal policy to offset some of these gains, keeping the  CAD at 7% of GDP. Although reserves will rise in 2014, on the assumption that  all planned Russian financing is disbursed, reserve coverage will remain well  below three months of imports. Fitch now expects the exchange rate to hold at USD/UAH8.3 through 1H15. Although  the authorities could in theory take advantage of relief from external pressure  to float the hryvnia, Fitch considers this unlikely ahead of the April 2015  presidential elections. In a revised version of the long-delayed 2014 budget, the government has  loosened its fiscal stance and will target a consolidated budget deficit of 4.3%  of GDP, up 1.6pp of GDP from the previous draft. Under the widest measure of  general government and including Naftogaz losses, the fiscal deficit exceeded 6%  of GDP in 2013 and will widen in 2014.
