MILAN, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's Banca Popolare di Milano <PMII.MI> rose more than 2 percent on Friday as the market braced for the appointment of a new CEO at the cooperative lender, after a 2-1/2 month power vacuum.

Pop Milano's supervisory board is expected to pick Giuseppe Castagna, former top executive at Italy's largest bank by assets Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, later in the day. "The stock is supported by expectations of Castagna's appointment, though it has been well flagged for a while," a Milan trader said. At 0816 GMT Popolare Milano shares were up 2.5 percent to 0.548 euros, outperforming a 0.3 percent rise in European banking index <.SX7P>
