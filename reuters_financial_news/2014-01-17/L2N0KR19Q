NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Foreign investors interested in tapping the Chilean fixed income market may be able to put money to work before the end of the month, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said on Friday.

Capping a two-year effort to reform its financial sector and give fixed income investors streamlined access to Chile as equity investors currently have, Larrain said he hopes the final signatures on the 'Ley Unica de Fondos', or 'Investment Funds Act', will be completed before January is over. Larrain, who will leave the government in March when the incoming center-left government of President-elect Michelle Bachelet takes over, lamented that foreigners own just 1 percent of Chilean fixed income, versus 35 to 40 percent of company stock. "What the laws have done for equities, this will do for fixed income," Larrain told Reuters in an interview.  The law employs a raft of tax changes designed to make Chile's fixed income market more attractive to foreign investors and improve its liquidity. Instead of five different laws applying to investment funds, there will be one which distinguishes by investor type. Reforms include allowing over-the-counter trading by eliminating a rule that requires bonds to trade only on the stock market, granting foreigners tax exemptions on capital gains, dividends and VAT, and removing a tax penalty for issuing bonds under par. "One single piece of legislation. What does this mean? More competition and reduced costs," Larrain said, adding: "Chile with this single law on funds will be able to compete with countries like Luxembourg and Hong Kong, other places that are very competitive in attracting funds to incorporate in their economies." Earlier on Friday Chile said it would issue up to $6 billion of debt in the local market this year. [ID:nL2N0KR0ZL] Larrain did not give an update on the economic outlook for Chile, the world's largest copper producer, saying that would be for whoever serves as the next finance minister. Chile, which relies heavily on exports of copper to China, has seen its economy start to falter with economic output weakening and domestic demand cooling down, especially investments. "A China that grows less means that the record prices for commodities is not longer with us," Larrain told Thomson Reuters IFR. "Having copper at $3.30 per pound we can live with it there. We had it at $4.40 or $4.50 per pound but that always creates trouble on the foreign exchange side. China is not in a hard landing. We have to get used to a China that grows at 7.5 percent and not 9.5 percent or 10 percent," he said. Chile, like all emerging markets in the last year, has seen its currency depreciate against the U.S. dollar as talk of cutting back the size of monetary stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve started in May of last year. The so-called quantitative easing flooded global markets with cash, much of which was sent to emerging markets, enticed by higher interest rates. In 2013, the Chilean peso depreciated by some 9 percent and on Friday it hit a 3-1/2 year low of 545 per U.S. dollar <CLP=>. "We are pretty comfortable (with the pace of depreciation)," Larrain said. "This is within what I would consider, in the current situation, at an equilibrium rate or within a range of equilibrium rates for the Chilean economy."
