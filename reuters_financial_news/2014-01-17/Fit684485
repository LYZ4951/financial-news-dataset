Jan 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed Tunisia-based construction  group Servicom's National Long- and Short-term ratings of 'B(tun)' on Rating  Watch Negative (RWN). Fitch has also assigned Servicom a senior unsecured rating  of 'B(tun)' and simultaneously placed the rating on RWN.  The RWN reflects Servicom's increased leverage in 2013 to a level inconsistent  with its ratings. The business continues to generate negative cash flows,  leaving little scope for de-leveraging over the next two years. Servicom is in the process of raising TND20m of equity, which if successful,  should allow leverage to return to levels more consistent with the current  ratings and provide some buffer to liquidity. Under such a scenario, Fitch  expects funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to improve to around  3x in 2014 from 5.2x forecast for FY13. Additionally, the capital increase will  provide Servicom with funding flexibility for business growth.  The capital increase, of which TND9.4m will be through a share offering in the  Tunis Stock Exchange, is subject to the approval of the financial market  authority, Conseil du Marche Financier. The transaction is expected to be closed  in 1Q14. Fitch expects to resolve the RWN once the transaction is completed and  following a full review of Servicom's credit metrics.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Increased Leverage  Fitch expects Servicom's FFO adjusted net leverage to increase to 5.2x at FYE13,  from 3.7x at FYE12, and to remain above 5x if the capital increase is not  successful. If the TND20m capital increase is successful FFO adjusted net  leverage should fall to around 3x in 2014 and remain at 3.5x over the next two  years, levels which are compatible with its current ratings. Under the new  shareholder agreement related to the capital increase, Servicom has committed to  maintain net debt/EBITDA below 2.5x (forecast at 4.2x at FYE13). This commitment  is likely to enforce more disciplined financial management.   New Organisation Structure To accommodate the capital increase, Servicom's founding shareholders have  grouped their interests in a new entity Servicom Holding SA. Servicom Holding SA  owns 53% of Servicom shares and will fund its share of the capital increase  through a contribution from the founding shareholders, the participation of a  local equity fund, Maghreb Private Equity Fund II, and by raising bank debt. The  bank debt at Servicom Holding SA will be on a non-recourse basis to Servicom.  This new shareholding structure will likely force Servicom, from 2015 onwards,  to upstream dividends to repay the bank loan. The Fitch rating case has assumed  a 60% dividend payout ratio starting from 2015, which should cover the bank loan  amortisation. Considering the above, we view the new organisation structure as  neutral to Servicom's ratings.   Material Funding Needs Fitch expects continued business growth to generate material funding needs.  Servicom demonstrated strong access to bank funding and debt markets in 2013.  The announced capital increase should support Servicom's funding needs. However,  additional funding requirements may arise if the group is to maintain business  growth over the next three years.   Weak Liquidity Servicom's cash from operations (CFO) is negative due to high working capital  needs resulting from exposure to the state and state-related entities with long  payment delays but low payment risk.  Receivables collection rose to 357 days in  2012 from 288 days in 2011 and is likely to have remained high in 2013. This is  likely to have kept CFO negative in 2013. According to Fitch's rating base case,  FCF will remain negative over the next two years and refinancing risk high.Fairly Limited Scale/Exposure to Tunisia The ratings reflect the company's small size in the Tunisian construction sector  (including telecom network deployment) compared with Fitch-rated peers both in  Tunisia and internationally. The business is mainly domestic (90% of revenue)  and geographical diversification is limited despite growing shares in Morocco  and France. Although Fitch views positively Servicom's expansion into these  lower-risk markets, it is not without execution risk.   Strong Growth Continues; Resilient Performance Servicom continues to post strong growth despite a weak economic environment in  Tunisia, benefiting from its niche position in public infrastructure projects.  Revenue is expected by Fitch to have risen to TND47m in 2013 from only TND26m in  2011. Servitra, the subsidiary operating in infrastructure projects, expects  revenue to have grown to TND18m in 2013 from only TND10m in 2011. Fitch expects  Servicom's revenue growth to slow due to the execution risk of overseas  expansion and economic uncertainty in Tunisia.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
