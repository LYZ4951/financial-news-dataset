JOHANNESBURG, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Nigerian bond and Treasury bill yields will likely take their direction from the central bank's interest rates decision next week. In Kenya, yields could rise at a 10-year Treasury bond sale next week.

NIGERIA Nigeria's debt market is expected to take its cue from the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting next week, though yields at the long end of the curve could inch up as local investors opt for Treasury bills and offshore interest wanes with the turn in U.S. monetary policy. Traders said bond yields have been climbing since the start of the year while strong demand from pension funds has brought down Treasury bill yields. "The market is presently bulging with liquidity and the bulk of the funds are being channeled into the Treasury bill market with attendant decline in yields," one dealer said. Nigeria's Debt Management Office sold 45 billion naira ($281 million) each in 3- and 20-year bonds <0#NGTSY=> this week [ID:nL5N0KQ1M6]. Yields on both tenors rose from the previous auction in December when a total of 75 billion naira was on offer. Traders said the higher yields were due to the large amount on offer and the absence of offshore investors.The MPC will meet on Monday and Tuesday. At its last meeting in November, the committee held interest rates steady at 12 percent but warned that factors including the reduction in U.S. monthly monetary stimulus - which many investors had used to buy higher-yielding assets such as Nigeria's - may further tighten monetary conditions.  KENYA Yields on Kenyan government securities are likely to be mixed at auctions next week, with those of Treasury bills dropping and that of a 10-year Treasury bond expected to rise. The central bank is scheduled to sell a 10-year Treasury bond <KE10YT=RR>, as well as 91-day <KE3MT=RR>, 182-day <KE6MT=RR> and 364-day Treasury bills <KE1YT=RR> next week. The yield on the benchmark three-month instrument fell to 9.17 percent at this week's auction from 9.32 percent the previous week in line with those of the other Treasury bills. "T-bill yields will continue dropping. If you look at the overnight (borrowing rate) trend, it has been going down systematically," said Anthony Wangari of SBG Securities. The weighted average interest rate on the overnight borrowing market for banks tumbled to 8.96 percent on Thursday from 10.37 percent at the start of the week.
