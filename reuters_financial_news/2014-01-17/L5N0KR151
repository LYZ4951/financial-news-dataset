LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest banks will be forced to sell off branches to make room for new competitors if the opposition Labour party wins the next election, leader Ed Miliband said on Friday. [ID:nL5N0KQ44E]

Miliband pledged to break up the financial sector by imposing a cap on the market share of personal banking and small business banking that any single institution can have - a move was designed to inject competition into the sector.
