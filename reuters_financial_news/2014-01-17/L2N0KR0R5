BRASILIA, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's benchmark stock index dropped on Friday, approaching near five-month lows after renewed signs of economic weakness hurt shares of homebuilders.

The Bovespa index <.BVSP>, which tracks the most-traded stocks on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, declined 0.5 percent. Chile's IPSA stock index <.IPSA> and Mexico's IPC index were little changed from Thursday's close. Economic activity in Brazil as measured by the central bank's IBC-Br index <BRIBC=ECI> contracted more than expected in November despite a surge in retail sales, throwing cold water on hopes of a modest recovery. [ID:nL2N0KR0EB] "While the economy is struggling to grow, the market thinks the central bank will have to keep raising interest rates to curb inflation. It's a bad outlook for homebuilders," said Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist at Banco Mizuho. Shares of homebuilders Gafisa SA <GFSA3.SA>, PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes <PDGR4.SA> and Brookfield Incorporacoes SA <BISA3.SA> lost between 1.8 and 2.8 percent. Homebuilder Tecnisa SA <TCSA3.SA>, which is not included in the Bovespa index, fell 1.43 percent to 8.27 reais also due to a high number of project cancellations in the fourth quarter. Options expiration on Monday could increase volatility on Friday's session, traders said. Blue chip shares such as state-run oil giant Petrobras <PETR4.SA> and global miner Vale <VALE5.S> dropped 0.06 and 0.53 percent, respectively. * Shares of college operator Estacio Participacoes SA <ESTC3.SA> dropped 0.66 percent to 19.59 reais after the company denied market rumors about a possible merger deal with U.S.-based Laureate Education Inc <WGNALL.UL>. * Deutsche Bank cut its target price for U.S.-traded shares of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA <GOL.N> to $8 from $10 previously. Shares of the Brazilian airline in the Bovespa <GOLL4.SA> were unchanged at 10.75 reais.Key Latin American stock indexes at 1437 GMT:   Stock indexes  daily %YTD %Latest   change change  MSCI LatAm   3,068.43  0.07   -4.2  <.MILA00000PUS> Brazil Bovespa   49,468.57 -0.46  -3.96  <.BVSP> Mexico IPC   42,150.67 -0.05  -1.35  <.MXX>  Chile IPSA   3,677.10  0.11   -0.60  <.IPSA> Chile IGPA   18,155.60 0.12   -0.39  <.IGPA> Argentina MerVal 5,928.26  1.62   9.97  <.MERV> Colombia IGBC12,574.11 0.18   -3.80  <.IGBC> Peru IGRA16,406.03 0.52   4.14  <.IGRA> Venezuela IBC2,763.89  0  1.00  <.IBC>
