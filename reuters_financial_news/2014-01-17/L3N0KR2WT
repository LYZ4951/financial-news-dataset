MUMBAI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Friday after Tata Consultancy Services slumped as its quarterly profit adjusted for other income lagged expectations, sparking some profit-taking in recently outpeforming software services exporters.

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd <TCS.NS> provisionally fell 5.6 percent, marking its biggest single-day percentage fall since May 2012, while Wipro Ltd <WIPR.NS> fell 2.6 percent ahead of its results later in the day.
