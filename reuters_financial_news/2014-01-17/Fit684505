Jan 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Propertize B.V.'s (Propertize, the former SNS Property Finance B.V.) EUR4,055m state-guaranteed ECP and MTN programme a Long-term rating of 'AAA' and a Short-term rating of 'F1+'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's belief that the Dutch state (AAA/Negative/F1+, see  "Fitch Affirms The Netherlands at 'AAA'; Outlook Negative" dated 17 January 2014  at www.fitchratings.com) will meet its financial obligations arising from the  guarantee it has extended to the debt securities to be issued under the  programme. The guarantee is expressed to be irrevocable and unconditional. The  'Rules of the Propertize Debt Guarantee Scheme', a publicly available document,  describes the guarantee's framework and principles.  As part of the nationalisation of SNS REAAL in February 2013, the Dutch  authorities envisaged the transfer of SNS Bank's property finance exposures to  an ad-hoc state-owned company. The nationalisation and related transactions,  considered state aid, required approval by the European Commission (EC). This  was given on 18 December 2013 (see 'Fitch: No Immediate Rating Impact from EC  Approval of SNS Restructuring Plan' published on 19 December 2013 at  www.fitchratings.com). On 30 December, the shares of SNS Property Finance were  transferred to the Dutch state, and the ad-hoc company has since been renamed  Propertize.   The proceeds of the ECP and MTN programme's issuance will be used to gradually  repay the state-guaranteed funding provided by SNS Bank to Propertize. First  issuance under the programme is expected during 1Q13. Under the programme,  Propertize cannot issue debt securities with maturities beyond 31 December 2023.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
