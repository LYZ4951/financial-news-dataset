Singapore, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Singapore shares struggled on Friday, on track for a weekly decline after downbeat bank earnings in the U.S. caused Wall Street to decline and weighed on Asian shares.

Goldman Sachs Group <GS.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> were among the banks that reported lower-than-expected quarterly profits due to lower bond trading revenue. [ID:nL2N0KQ2AY] The benchmark Straits Times index <.FTSTI> fell for a second consecutive session, easing 0.1 percent to 3,137.13 by 0523 GMT, while the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was 0.2 percent higher. Real estate firms were among the biggest losers on the index with City Developments Ltd <CTDM.SI> shares slipping as much as 1.9 percent to a one-week low at S$9.41. Shopping mall developer CapitaMalls Asia Ltd <CMAL.SI> fell as much as 2.1 percent, hitting a five-week low at S$1.87. Shares of transport operator SMRT Corporation Ltd <SMRT.SI> advanced as much as 2.1 percent to a more than one-month high at S$1.19 while Comfortdelgro Corporation Ltd <CMDG.SI> dipped as much as 1.5 percent to S$1.94, its lowest in a month. Maybank Kim Eng said the Public Transport Council's announcement on Thursday of a 3.2 percent increase in fares fell short of the brokerage's expectation of 5 percent. It maintained its negative view on SMRT, citing persistent cost pressures and the prospect of cannibalisation from the new Downtown Line Stage 2 in 2016. Comfortdelgro offered more insulated exposure and was seen as more favourable, Maybank said.
