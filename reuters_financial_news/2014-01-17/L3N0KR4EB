Jan 17 (Reuters) - M&T Bank Corp <MTB.N> reported quarterly results that were worse than analysts' expectations as mortgage banking revenue fell and expenses increased.

M&T Bank shares slipped more than 3 percent on Friday. Net income fell 17 percent to $245.72 million, or $1.74 per share, from $296.19 million, or $2.16 per share, a year earlier. [ID:nPn97VGmS] Mortgage banking revenue fell 29 percent to $82.1 million while expenses rose 12 percent to $703.07 million. Net interest income, the difference between what banks earns on loans and pays out on deposits fell 1 percent to $734.46 million. Excluding items, the bank earned $1.79 per share, well below analysts' average estimate of $1.92 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank has been in the spotlight for more than one year over its proposed acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp Inc <HCBK.O>, which has been delayed due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's concerns about M&T's anti-money laundering procedures. Last month M&T Bank said it now expected the acquisition to close at the end of 2014 instead of Jan. 31.  Credit card issuer Capital One Financial <COF.N> reported lower-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday as net interest income fell in both its credit card and consumer banking businesses.
