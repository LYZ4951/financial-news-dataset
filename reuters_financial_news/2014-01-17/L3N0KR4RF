Jan 17 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service raised Ireland's debt ratings to Baa3/P-3 from Ba1/NP, citing recent acceleration in economic growth and the government's exit from the euro bailout.

Moody's also changed its outlook for the rating to positive. "The growth potential of the Irish economy, which together with ongoing fiscal consolidation is expected to bring government debt ratios down from their recent peak," the credit rating agency said.
