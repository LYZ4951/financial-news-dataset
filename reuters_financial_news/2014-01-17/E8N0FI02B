MADRID, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Spanish banks' bad loans as a percentage of total lending reached a fresh record high of 13.08 percent in November, up from 12.99 pct in October, Bank of Spain data showed on Monday.

The ratio has been steadily climbing as households and small companies struggle with debts and as banks, fighting to improve their own capital quality ahead of Europe-wide stress tests, rein in lending.
