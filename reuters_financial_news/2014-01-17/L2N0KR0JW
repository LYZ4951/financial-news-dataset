NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures advanced on Friday, in the wake of earnings from Morgan Stanley and General Electric, and ahead of data on the housing market and consumer sentiment.

* General Electric Co <GE.N> slipped 1.1 pct to $26.89 in premarket trading, after gaining 0.6 percent earlier. The conglomerate posted a rise in quarterly net profit on Friday, helped by strength in its businesses selling oil pumps and jet engines. [ID:nL2N0KR0GT] * Morgan Stanley <MS.N> rose 1.9 percent to $32.61 before the opening bell even as it reported a slump in quarterly profit. [ID:nL3N0KR3N0] <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Morning Call: Morgan Stanley's misses on legal costs http://reut.rs/1ang0Td^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> * Shares of Intel Corp <INTC.O> shed 3.6 percent to $25.58 after its earnings missed expectations by a penny in the fourth quarter due to weak spending on servers. The chipmaker gave a lukewarm forecast for first-quarter revenue. [ID:nL2N0KQ241] * After surging 30 percent in 2013, the S&P 500 <.SPX> started the year on a weak note but recovered recently to set a new record high Wednesday. It is now roughly flat for the year.  * S&P 500 futures <SPc1> rose 4.3 points Friday and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> gained 43 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> added 7.75 points. * Investors will eye December housing starts data at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT). Expectations were for an annualized figure of 990,000, slightly lower than 1.09 million reported in the prior month.  * Industrial output data for December is expected at 9:15 a.m. (1415 GMT). Expectations call for a 0.3 percent increase versus a 1.1 percent gain in the prior month.  * At 9:55 a.m. the preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers for January is due. Estimates call for a reading of 83.5, up from the 82.5 previously reported.  * European shares edged up to fresh 5-1/2 year highs, with stronger-than-expected UK retail sales reassuring investors about the strength of the region's economy and counterbalancing a profit warning by Shell <RDSa.L>.
