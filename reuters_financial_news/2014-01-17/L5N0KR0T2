LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Britain's Debt Management Office said on Friday it has appointed a syndicate of banks for the re-opening of an ultra-long dated gilt linked to inflation.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Nomura and Scotiabank will manage the sale of the 0.125 percent index-linked Treasury Gilt maturing in 2068, it said in a statement.
