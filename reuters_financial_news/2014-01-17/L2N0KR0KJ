Jan 17 (Reuters) - As Wall Street's biggest banks reported quarterly earnings this week, many of them also offered a glimpse into the scale of their commodity market activity through a measure of trading risk called Value-at-Risk, or VaR.

Morgan Stanley <MS.N> on Friday reported its commodity prices VaR fell to $18 million in the fourth quarter, its lowest since 2000, when it stood at $17 million, on average, for the year. It was down $2 million from $20 million in the third quarter, and off $4 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. VaR is the most amount of money that can be lost on 95 percent of the trading days during the period. Typical of Wall Street banks, Morgan Stanley groups its commodities revenue under the fixed income category but does not break out the sector. That often leaves VaR as one of the key risk-reward indicators that can measure commodities exposure.  For the quarter, fixed income revenue was $694 million, excluding an accounting item, down from $811 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Morgan Stanley said the lower net revenue for the fixed income category was primarily due weakness in interest rate products. The following is a table of VaR, in millions of dollars, for five major U.S. banks: 20132012
