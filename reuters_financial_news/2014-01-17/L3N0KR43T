Jan 17 (Reuters) - Shares of CHC Group Ltd <HELI.N>, the world's largest commercial helicopter operator, fell as much as 7 percent in their market debut, valuing the company at about $700 million.

The Cayman Islands-based company raised $310 million after its initial public offering was priced at $10 per share, below its expected price range of $12-$14. CHC shares opened at $9.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. CHC was taken private in a $1.48 billion deal in 2008 by energy-focused private equity firm First Reserve Corp, which holds about 61.3 percent of the company.
