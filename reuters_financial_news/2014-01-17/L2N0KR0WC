HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA <ABI.BR> is in advanced discussions to buy South Korea's Oriental Brewery from private equity owners KKR & Co LP <KKR.N> and Affinity Equity Partners for more than $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The parties are hammering out final terms of a deal with the aim to reach an agreement before the end of January, the people said. Discussions are continuing and could still fall apart, and there is no guarantee that a deal will be struck, the people cautioned, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. If final terms are agreed, a deal could come as early as next week, one person added. AB InBev, KKR and Affinity declined to comment. Oriental Brewery could not be immediately reached for comment. AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, sold Oriental Brewery to KKR for $1.8 billion in 2009. That sale was part of InBev's efforts to raise money to ease the debt burden from its acquisition of U.S. beer maker Anheuser-Busch a year earlier. KKR later sold half of the equity stake in Oriental Brewery to Affinity. Under the 2009 deal, AB InBev has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back Oriental Brewery on predetermined financial terms within five years after the closing of the transaction, a period that expires in July this year.  The agreement allows KKR to sell Oriental Brewery back to AB InBev for around 11 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), according to the people familiar with the matter. OB, as the brewer is known, reported EBITDA of around $400 million in its last financial statement, posted at the end of 2012. The brewer cut costs, increased cash flows and gained market share under KKR's ownership to become South Korea's biggest brewer. A successful deal will mark one of the Asia's biggest private equity transactions in recent times, and would also represent the biggest-ever Asian exit for KKR and Affinity. The potential deal comes amid upbeat prospects for beer consumption in Asia, with the region's $258 billion market growing twice as fast as the rest of the world. [ID:nL4N0AX0Y5] That has attracted global brewers to the region, with Carlsberg <CARLb.CO>, Heineken NV <HEIN.AS> and SABMiller Plc <SAB.L> all striking deals in Asia over the past five years as they show strong appetite for the region to offset sluggish sales in mature markets. As a result, beer-related M&A in Asia has commanded rich premiums, with global companies paying up to buy companies to either get a foothold in fast growing markets or to protect their turf from home grown competitors. Heineken NV paid $6.4 billion for control of Tiger beer maker Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd in 2012, translating into a multiple of 35 times earnings.
