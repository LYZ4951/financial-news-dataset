MEXICO CITY, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Brazil's benchmark stock index dropped on Friday, closing on a more than five-month low after renewed signs of economic weakness eroded confidence in the country's tepid recovery.

The Bovespa index <.BVSP>, which tracks the most-traded stocks on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, declined 1.04 percent. Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> fell 0.62 percent, while Chile's IPSA index <.IPSA> added 0.86 percent. Economic activity in Brazil as measured by the central bank's IBC-Br index <BRIBC=ECI> contracted more than expected in November despite a surge in retail sales, throwing cold water on hopes of a modest recovery.
