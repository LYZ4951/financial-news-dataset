SEOUL, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Seoul shares slipped to a one-week closing low on Friday after downbeat U.S. corporate results chilled risk sentiment ahead of domestic earnings reports due next week.

Offshore investors sold a net 100.2 billion won ($94 million) worth of KOSPI shares, weighing on the main bourse. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.7 percent at 1,944.48 points, its lowest close since Jan. 10. But the KOSPI rose 0.3 percent for the week, posting its first weekly gain of the year.
