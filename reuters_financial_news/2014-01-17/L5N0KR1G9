LJUBLJANA, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Friday Slovenia's economy would shrink 1.1 percent this year, extending the troubled euro zone member's recession into a third straight year.

The Fund expects the economy to have shrunk 1.7 percent in 2013, when Slovenia narrowly avoided a bailout by rescuing its banks from their bad loan problems in December.  The government's macroeconomic institute has forecast a 0.8 percent economic contraction for this year. In a statement issued after a regular review visit to Slovenia, the Fund supported the government's budget deficit target of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product for 2014, which excludes the funds for recapitalisation of banks. However, it voiced concerns about the quality of the fiscal measures behind the budgetary plan, zeroing in on long-delayed reforms. "We advise more ambitious public employment reduction, better targeting of social transfers and specific cuts in transfers and subsidies," it said. External auditors put the total cost of the bank overhaul at 4.8 billion euros, close to 14 percent of Slovenia's GDP. The government injected 3.2 billion euros in capital into five banks in December.  Earlier this month Slovenia said it would need 3.5 billion euros in 2014 to roll over its debts, cover its budget shortfall and help pay for banking consolidation.  The IMF also said it was important to improve bank governance and reduce the dominant role of the state in the economy.
