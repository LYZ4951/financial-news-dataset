SHANGHAI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China's money rates jumped this week as liquidity conditions deteriorated sharply ahead of the Spring Festival holiday, with traders watching to see if the central bank will maintain its passive stance and allow another cash crunch to unfold.

Cash demand typically rises ahead of China's Spring Festival, or Lunar New Year, as households and corporates withdraw cash to pay for holiday spending and year-end bonuses. The holiday falls on Jan. 31 this year and will see the money markets closed for a week.  Cash is also tight in January because companies start paying income and other taxes for the previous year, which channels funds out of commercial banks and into the state treasury, traders said. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) did not conduct any open market operations this week for the third straight week. [CN/MMT] The decision not to inject cash into markets continues a tight stance that observers say is intended to curb off-balance-sheet lending, which is often funded with interbank borrowing.  But a senior PBOC official said in remarks published on Friday that the central bank would use various tools to adjust liquidity in a flexible way to help maintain appropriate growth in credit and social financing. [ID:nB9N0K2016] China's benchmark money market rate, the seven-day bond repurchase rate <CN7DRP=CFXS>, was at 4.99 percent on a weighted-average basis by midday on Friday, jumping 96 basis points from the end of last week. The overnight repo <CN1DRP=CFXS> rose 12 bps to 2.86 percent, while the 14-day repo was up 10 bps at 4.84 percent. "The rates have the potential to rise further ahead of the Spring Festival," said a trader at major Chinese state-owned bank in Shanghai. "But judging from December's experience, the PBOC is likely to use tools like reverse repos and short-term liquidity operations to come to the market's rescue when the weighted average of the 7-day repo reaches around 7 percent." Demand for cash in the money market typically spikes at the end of each quarter and around major holidays. The PBOC engineered two interbank market squeezes in June and December, refusing to aid the banks with large cash injections to cope with elevated seasonal demand. [CN/] The refusal reflected the PBOC's unhappiness with banks' lack of progress in deleveraging their interbank positions to reduce financial risks. The central bank has led traders to expect periodic bouts of tight liquidity in the money market this year. [ID:nL3N0K910B] Tight money has caused China's interest-rate swaps linked to the seven-day repo rate <CNYQB7RIRS=> to jump. Five-year IRS of this type <CNQBWR5Y=> were quoted at 5.15 percent at midday on Friday, above the current level of the underlying seven-day repo rate.  But swaps based on the benchmark one-year bank deposit rate <CNYIRS1D=CN> have barely budged, indicating that the market is not expecting authorities to raise policy rates.
