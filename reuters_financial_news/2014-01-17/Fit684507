Jan 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Hong Kong-based Dah Sing Bank's [DAHSIN.UL] (DSB; BBB+/Stable) proposed Basel III-compliant Tier 2 dated subordinated notes an expected 'BBB(EXP)' rating. The direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations will be denominated in US  dollars and will be issued under DSB's USD2bn medium-term note programme. DSB  expects the issue to be about USD200mn in size, and it will use the proceeds to  absorb the impact of regulatory phase-out of the existing subordinated debt and  manage its capitalisation for future business growth. The notes will be callable  by DSB after five years.  The notes include a non-viability clause and will qualify as Tier 2 capital for  the bank under the Banking (Capital) Rules of Hong Kong upon approval from the  Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).  The final rating is contingent on the receipt of the final documents conforming  to information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Fitch rates the notes one notch below DSB's Viability Rating (VR) of 'bbb+'.  This is to reflect their below-average recovery prospects relative to senior  unsecured instruments given their subordination and their partial write-down  feature. The notes could be written down in full or in part if the HKMA  considers this step necessary to maintain the bank's viability (that is, at the  point of non-viability).  The notes have been notched from the bank's VR (the anchor rating) as the bank's  credit profile is driven by its standalone financial strength. The agency  believes no additional notching from the VR for non-performance is required to  capture the point of non-viability as it is broadly the same as that expressed  in the VR. DSB's total regulatory capital ratio was 14.2% at end-June 2013. The new issue  is likely to increase the capital ratio by about 1.4pp. This will support the  bank's asset growth and also absorb the regulatory phase-out of Tier 2 capital  instruments without non-viability clauses (0.3pp per annum) up to the first call  of two existing Tier 2 instruments. The legacy perpetual junior subordinated  debt and one of the two lower Tier 2 subordinated debt issues - totalling about  USD230m (1.6% of risk-weighted assets at end-June 2013) - are callable by DSB in  February 2017.  Under Fitch's methodology the instrument would not qualify for any equity  credit.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Any changes to DSB's VR would impact the issue's rating. The VR is sensitive to  Fitch's assessment of risk appetite and underwriting standards. The rating would  be downgraded if the bank expands the potentially riskier Chinese exposure or  increases the concentration in unsecured personal lending and commercial  property without balancing the higher risk by adequate profitability, capital  and liquidity.  An upgrade for the VR is unlikely given the lack of pricing power, the portfolio  concentration and high reliance on equity-accounted profits from Bank of  Chongqing <1963.HK>.The other ratings of DSB are unaffected and are as follows:  Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR): 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR: 'F2' Viability Rating: 'bbb+'  Support Rating: '3' Support Rating Floor: 'BB' Senior unsecured debt: 'BBB+'  Lower Tier 2 subordinated debt without non-viability clauses: 'BBB'
