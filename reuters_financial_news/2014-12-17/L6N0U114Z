LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Index provider MSCI said it may exclude Russia from its emerging markets benchmark if authorities introduced capital or foreign exchange controls.

Around $1.4 trillion are benchmarked against MSCI's Emerging Markets share index <.MSCIEF>, which are used by many investment funds to determine their weightings.  "The introduction of restrictive measures, such as capital or foreign exchange controls, which may lead to a material deterioration of Russian equity market accessibility, may lead to the exclusion of the MSCI Russia Index from the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and a reclassification proposal of such market to Standalone Market status," the index provider said in a statement.
