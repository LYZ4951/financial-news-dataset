RABAT, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Morocco may revise the weightings of its currency basket, the head of central bank said, in an effort to end dependence on the euro, which hit a two-year low this month against the dollar.

The North African kingdom has been trying to diversify economic partners since the euro crisis, which badly hurt the country's economy. Moroccan companies have started to expand in Africa, while the government has signed agreements with other regions across the world, mainly the Arab Gulf countries and China. "Maybe it's time to revise our weightings," central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri told reporters. "Our international trade is now divided between euros and dollars 50 pct each" he added. Few years ago, the euro dominated the Moroccan currency basket, accounting for more than 70 pct. But the move is also linked to demands by the International Monetary Fund, which has been urging Morocco to adopt more exchange rate flexibility to make its economy more competitive and better able to absorb shocks. "If the central bank says so, it is because of the euro weakening and the oil price drop in the global market" Mehdi Lahlou, an economist in the university of Rabat said. "The bank wants to protect Moroccan exports and gain maximum benefits from the low oil prices."  Moroccan public finances have been improving as the government cut subsidies and froze public-sector hiring. The government has become more confident as oil prices fell, since Morocco remains one of the top energy importers in the region.  On Tuesday, the central bank cut the benchmark interest rate a quarter of percentage point to 2.5 pct to boost the economy. It expects the economy to grow by 4.4 pct in 2015, up from 2.5 pct in 2014, thanks to good levels of rainfall which will boost agricultural output.
