WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - A Cuban national freed from prison by the Cuban government provided "critical assistance" to United States agencies in exposing Cuban agents who had infiltrated the U.S. government, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence's office said on Wednesday.

The informant, whose identity U.S. officials declined to disclose, helped U.S. investigators identify and convict Ana Belen Montez, a senior Defense Intelligence Agency official who was one of the highest-ranking U.S. officials ever proven to have spied for Cuba, the office said in a statement.
