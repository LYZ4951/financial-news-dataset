WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Dutch and Swiss oil trading firms for their dealings with the Syrian government, which has been engaged in bloody civil war with opposition forces.

The U.S. Treasury put Netherlands-based Staroil B.V. as well as two Swiss-based firms, Rixo International Trading Ltd and Bluemarine SA, on its list of sanctioned entities, which effectively cuts them off from the U.S. financial system. The Treasury also put sanctions on several officials from the firms, as well as on a company based in Syria and another from the United Arab Emirates.
