NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds tied to Russia rallied on Wednesday, providing some relief after the funds have been beaten down some 50 percent year-to-date.

The SPDR S&P Russia ETF <RBL.P> jumped 12.6 percent in Wednesday trading on the NYSE Arca exchange, while the iShares MSCI Russia Capped Index Fund <ERUS.P> gained 11.2 percent and the Market Vectors Russia ETF <RSX.P> rose 9.1 percent. The funds have all dropped around 50 percent year-to-date through Tuesday as Russian equities have soured this year amid the rouble's decline.
