CAIRO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The UAE's Abraaj Investment Management asked Egypt's financial regulator on Wednesday to approve a revised offer of 84.66 Egyptian pounds per share for Egyptian snackmaker Bisco Misr <BISM.CA>, topping a rival bid by Kellogg <K.N>.

If approved, the fresh bid would beat Kellogg's offer of 82.2 pounds per share. Egypt's regulator last week extended the period for Abraaj to match Kellogg's bid to Dec. 24.[ID:nL6N0TT2ZS]
