SYDNEY, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Australia-listed construction giant Leighton Holdings Ltd <LEI.AX> said it had formed a joint venture with New York-listed Apollo Global Management LLC <APO.N> to run its services businesses, valuing the firms at A$1.08 billion ($880 million).

Sydney-based, Spanish-controlled Leighton said on Wednesday that it and Apollo agreed to form a 50:50 investment partnership covering a range of Leighton-owned services businesses spanning the communications, energy and other infrastructure sectors. The deal valued the Leighton businesses at A$1.075 billion and would give Leighton cash proceeds of A$700 million, reducing its debt gearing by about 10 percentage points. Leighton, controlled by Spain's ACS Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA <ACS.MC> through its German subsidiary Hochtief AG <HOTG.DE>, has been looking to sell or partly sell businesses to cut debt and exposure to the ailing mining industry.
