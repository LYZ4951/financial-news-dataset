Dec 17 (Reuters) - Turkish Islamic lender Turkiye Finans Katilim Bankasi has applied to issue 143 million lira ($60.5 million) via sukuk, or Islamic bonds, according to Turkey's Capital Markets Board.

The sukuk will be issued through TF Varlik Kiralama, a wholly-owned unit of Turkiye Finans, which has a focus on loans to corporate clients. No tenor or details of underlying assets were given for the deal. Turkiye Finans, majority owned by Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank <1180.SE>, is one of four Islamic banks in the country, known as participation banks. Separately, the bank has also received regulatory approval for a 71 million lira sukuk for trailer manufacturer Tirsan Treyler Sanayi ve Ticaret.
