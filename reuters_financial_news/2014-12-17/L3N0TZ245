TOKYO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock index is expected to gain around 13 percent next year, as a weaker yen raises hopes of higher earnings for exporters, while the Bank Of Japan's asset buying programme is seen underpinning risk appetite, a Reuters poll found.

The Nikkei <.N225> surged to 7-1/2-year highs earlier this month, helped by the dollar touching a seven-year peak against the yen and U.S. data pointing to a resilient economy.  Japan's benchmark is expected to rise to 19,000 by the end of 2015, according to the median forecast of 62 analysts polled by Reuters in the past week, up 13 percent from Wednesday's close of 16,755.32. In mid-2015, the Nikkei is seen trading at 18,350. Forecasts for the end of 2015 were in a wide range - from 8,000 to 24,000. For next June they went from 12,000 to 21,000. Market observers said investors would continue buying into Japanese exporters as a cheaper yen makes them more competitive abroad and lifts their profits when repatriated. "As the global economy continues to recover gradually, led by growth in the U.S. economy in 2015, the dollar is expected to stay above 120 yen reflecting divergent monetary policies between the U.S. Federal Reserve and the BOJ," said Takashi Maruyama, head of equity fund management department at Nikko Asset Management. Downside market risks include contagion from a spiralling currency crisis in Russia, the timing of interest rate hikes by the Fed and slowing global growth, analysts said. But another powerful catalyst set to support the Japanese market is the BOJ's buying of exchange traded funds as part of its massive easing programme to jump-start the economy and vanquish 15 years of grinding deflation, analysts said. The BOJ shocked global financial markets on Oct. 31 by expanding its massive stimulus spending and said it would triple its purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to about 3 trillion yen a year.

"Long-term investors who look at fundamentals are likely to start buying," said Shun Maruyama, chief Japan equity strategist at BNP Paribas.  Participants also said falling oil prices are positive for most advanced economies, such as the U.S. and Japan, as they import the commodity.
