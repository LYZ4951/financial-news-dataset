MUMBAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged lower on Wednesday as volatility in global markets raised fears of more foreign selling, although indexes cut earlier losses of more than 1 percent as state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India bought shares aggressively.

LIC, a powerful market player in India that has been known to support markets at times of vulnerability, was seen buying into banks, software services and defensive stocks, traders said. [ID:nL3N0U1284] An LIC spokesman said the insurer does not comment on market speculation. Buying by the state-run insurer helped pare earlier losses of as much as 1.3 percent for the broader NSE index <.NSEI> in a session marked by continued concerns that foreign investors would sell out of emerging markets due to the brewing financial crisis in Russia. [MKTS/GLOB] Overseas investors sold shares worth 12.47 billion rupees ($196.6 mln) on Tuesday, their biggest daily net sales since Oct. 17, and have been net sellers for six consecutive sessions, according to regulatory data. [ID:nL3N0U11JA] "There was good buying after a sharp fall. We see markets are bottoming out. It should be range-bound for the time being," said Suresh Parmar, head of institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets." The NSE index ended 0.47 percent down at 8,029.80 points. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> closed 0.27 percent lower at 26,710.13 points, after having fallen 1.2 percent earlier in the day. Both the indexes fell for a fifth consecutive session, matching a five-day losing streak in July. Recent outperformers fell, with ITC Ltd <ITC.NS> ending down 2.3 percent as investors booked profits. The stock had gained 8.1 percent so far this month as of Monday compared with a 4.3 percent fall in the NSE. Pharmaceutical companies slumped on concerns about the global economy, even as they stood to benefit from a weaker rupee. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries <SUN.NS> closed down 2.3 percent, while Cipla Ltd <CIPL.NS> ended 2.9 percent lower. However, strong buying emerged in banks, especially State Bank of India <SBI.NS>, which closed 2.1 percent higher at 301.75 rupees.  Other banking stocks also gained. ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> ended 0.5 percent higher, while Bank of India <BOI.NS> gained 1.8 percent. Shares in Tata Steel <TISC.NS> ended 1 percent higher after a government official said the company might be allowed to resume production from its biggest iron ore mine this month. [ID:nL3N0U02IT] Mining stocks also gained. Sesa Sterlite <SESA.NS>, which fell 16.32 percent so far this month till Tuesday, ended 3.8 percent higher.
