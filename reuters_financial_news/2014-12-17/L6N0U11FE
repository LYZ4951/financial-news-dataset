VIENNA, Dec 17 (Reuters) - BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] has taken legal action in Vienna to try to recover from the Austrian state 2.4 billion euros ($3 billion) in funding it made to its Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL] unit before it was nationalised in 2009, the German bank said on Wednesday.

The suit adds another layer to a complex web of litigation over Hypo, whose near-collapse after a decade of unbridled expansion has cost taxpayers in both countries billions of euros. [ID:nL6N0U028K]  BayernLB cited contractual provisions that Austria would guarantee the financing package should Hypo be broken up or wound down, a step Vienna implemented this year. "BayernLB sees itself forced to pursue its claim via the courts and has filed suit against the Republic of Austria for around 2.4 billion euros," a BayernLB spokesman in Munich said.  A court spokesman confirmed the suit had been filed. Austria contends the financing to Hypo has to be treated as an equity injection rather than a loan given the dire straits Hypo was in at the time. It is readying its own suit alleging  BayernLB misled Austria over Hypo's condition.
