CAIRO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Wednesday and was unchanged on the unofficial market after the government established a fourth weekly dollar auction.

The bank offered $40 million and said it had sold $38.4 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBOE> to the dollar, a rate unchanged from its last sale on Monday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.In the unofficial market, the pound was trading at about 7.70 to the dollar on Wednesday, also unchanged from the previous day, one trader said.
