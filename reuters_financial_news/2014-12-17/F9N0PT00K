FRANKFURT, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Senior European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure said he sees a broad consensus on the bank's Governing Council for more action and that the issue is how best to do this, with buying government bonds "the baseline option."

Having largely exhausted its policy toolkit with its main interest rate at a record-low 0.05 percent, broad-based buying of sovereign bonds - also known as quantitative easing (QE) - is seen as the ECB's last resort to prevent a slide into deflation. "I see a broad consensus around the table in the Governing Council that we need to do more" to raise inflation and boost the economy, Coeure told the Wall Street Journal in an interview conducted late on Tuesday and published on Wednesday.  "It's not that much of a question on whether we should do something, but more a discussion on the best way to do it," added Coeure, who sits on the six-member Executive Board that forms the core of the 24-member policymaking Governing Council. "If we want to do more we obviously have to reach out to market segments where there is more liquidity and that is why the government bond market is the baseline option, which doesn't necessarily mean we would only buy government bonds," he said.
