MOSCOW, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble fell back on Wednesday as market was unimpressed by the Finance Ministry's foreign currency sales.

The ministry said on Wednesday it was selling foreign currency from its leftover stocks, of which it has around $7 billion, in a move that has briefly supported the rouble. [ID:nL6N0U114I] But by 0914 GMT, the rouble was down 1.3 percent against the U.S. dollar <RUBUTSTN=MCX> and 0.2 percent down against the euro <EURRUBTN=MCX>.
