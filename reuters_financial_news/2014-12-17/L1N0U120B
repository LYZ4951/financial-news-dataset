NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Leon Cooperman, chief executive of hedge fund Omega Advisors, said Wednesday that Groupon Inc <GRPN.O> was worth up to 50 percent more than its current share price.

"The stock seems mispriced. ... We think it's worth 40-50 percent more than it's trading," Cooperman told cable television network CNBC. He said the internet coupon company's business was turning around. Groupon was up 3.4 percent at $7.07 in early afternoon trading. Cooperman's Omega hedge fund took an 8.8 million share stake in Groupon in the third quarter, a regulatory filing on Nov. 14 showed.
