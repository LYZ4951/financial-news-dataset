BEIJING, Dec 17 (Reuters) - China stocks climbed higher on Wednesday as bank shares continued to surge on mainland markets, but Hong Kong's benchmark index slipped again and the price gap for dual-listed shares widened.

Financials have driven the mainland rally in recent weeks, taking markets to their highest levels in more than three years.  Volume of financial-share trading rose on Wednesday, following four days of declines.  The CSI300 index <.CSI300> rose 1.3 percent, to 3,347.26 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> gained 1.0 percent, to 3,051.46 points. The CSI 300 banking index was up 5.81 percent at the end of the morning, led by a 9.99 percent increase in Minsheng Bank <600016.SS> and 8.75 percent increase for Bank of Ningbo <002142.SZ>. The Hang Seng index <.HSI> dropped 0.2 percent, to 22,617.62 points.   The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> gained 0.9 percent, to 11,237.92. The index measuring price differences between dual-listed companies in Shanghai and Hong Kong <.HSCAHPI> climbed even further to 121.90, its highest mark since October 2011.  A value above 100 indicates Shanghai shares are pricing at a premium to shares in the same company trading in Hong Kong. As the mainland market has climbed, ever more retail investors have piled into A-shares to feed the rally while sentiment remains muted in Hong Kong on global growth concerns. [ID:nL3N0TO3KM] China CSI300 stock index futures for December rose 1.6 percent, to 3,355.2, a spread of 7.9 points above the current value of the underlying index.  Total volume of A shares traded in Shanghai was 31.83 billion shares, while Shenzhen volume was 13.23 billion shares.
