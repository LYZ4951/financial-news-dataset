WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The following are highlights of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's remarks at a press conference following the conclusion of the U.S. central bank's two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.

ON FED BEING "UNLIKELY" TO BEGIN NORMALIZATION VERY SOON  As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2-percent inflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy accommodation. But based on its current outlook, the committee judges that it can be patient in doing so. In particular, the committee considers it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings. This assessment of course is completely data dependent.   ON INFLATION The committee expects inflation to move gradually back towards its objective. In making this forecast, the committee is mindful of the recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation. At this point the committee views these movements as likely to prove transitory, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. That said, developments in this area obviously bear close watching.   ON NEW RATE GUIDANCE "The committee also updated its forward guidance for the federal funds rate indicating that the committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. This new language does not represent a change in our policy intentions and is fully consistent with our previous guidance, which stated that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the end of our asset purchase program. But with that program having ended in October and the economy continuing to make progress toward our objectives, the committee judged that some modification to our guidance is appropriate at this time."  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Full text of Fed statement:   [FED/FOMC]  Story on Fed policy meeting:  [ID:nTLAHNEA0L]  Take a look on Fed policy outlook:[FED/AHEAD]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
