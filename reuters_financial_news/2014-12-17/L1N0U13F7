Dec 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Empire Resorts Inc <NYNY.O> closed down 10.5 percent on Wednesday after a very volatile trading day for the company, which won a license to build a casino in New York state.

Nearly 16 percent of Empire's publicly available stock has sold short, making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the U.S. market, according to Reuters data. Short interest, a measure of bearish sentiment on a stock, has more than doubled since June. Its shares closed at $7.13 on Wednesday after touching an eight-month high of $9 and a low of $6.25 during an unusually active trading session. Over 2.2 million Empire shares changed hands, making the stock 13 times more active than its 10-day moving average for volume. The New York State Gaming Facility Location Board announced that Empire subsidiary Montreign Operating Company LLC had won the license to operate the casino in Thompson in upstate New York at a meeting that was slated for 2 p.m. on Wednesday. The company's stock jumped higher between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. before it reversed and headed back down. Empire's options volume was eight times its normal level with puts - typically used to make bearish bets on a stock - outnumbering calls by a ratio of 2:1. Empire Resorts Executive Vice President Charles Degliomini said the company is planning a $452 million project, which will include an 18-story hotel funded by a mix of debt and equity.
