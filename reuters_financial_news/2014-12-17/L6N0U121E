LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Shares of Russia-exposed Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> hit a new all-time low of 10.475 euros ($13) on Wednesday, falling more than 7 percent amid Russia's spiralling currency crisis and a prolonged slide in oil prices.

Raiffeisen is among the most exposed European banks to Eastern Europe, with a combined exposure to Russia and Ukraine of around 20 billion euros, or over 200 percent of tangible equity, according to Citi estimates. At 1140 GMT, Raiffeisen shares were down 7.6 percent at 10.64 euros.
