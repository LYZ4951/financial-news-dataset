SYDNEY, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Australia's benchmark share index is set to end 2015 at their highest since May 2008, a Reuters poll found, as prevalent risks from weak commodity prices are seen eclipsed by an improving U.S. economy and hefty inflows from pension funds.

Analysts had previously forecast the S&P/ASX 200 <.AXJO> index would hit 5,700 points by the end of 2014 but a recent market rout led by a slump in iron ore and oil prices forced them to push that target to the end of 2015. "Hopefully, we will see some relief in global economies and easy monetary policy, particularly in China," said Ben Le Brun, markets analyst at OptionsXpress.  "An overall pick-up in economic data domestically would be a big help to some industrial stocks." The S&P/ASX 200 is expected to end 2015 at 5,775 points, a 12 percent gain on the Dec. 16 close of 5,152, according to a median forecast of 12 analysts polled in the past week. Estimates for the year-end ranged from a low of 5,000 to a peak of 6,100.Analysts forecast the index would hit 5,500 points by June 30, with a range of 5,100 to 6,000 points. The stock market is also seen spurred higher by Australia's $550 billion self-managed super funds (SMSFs), which already own 16 percent of the Australian equity market.  These funds are expected to put an average of $1 billion a month into equities, said Credit Suisse analyst Hasan Tevfik. Data from the Australian Tax Office shows 42 percent of the SMSF money is invested in equities.  SMSFs or do-it-yourself retirement funds give retirees the flexibility to invest in any asset in any currency across the world without having to involve a fund manager, pay fees or worry about having their money in risky or exotic products. The benchmark is down around 4 percent in the year to Dec. 16 as foreign investors have pulled out amid rising bond yields, plunging prices for key commodity exports and a fall in the Australian dollar. Concerns about a slowdown in China, Australia's No.1 trading partner, have also curbed investor appetite. The Australian dollar has tumbled more than 7 percent so far this year, touching a 4-1/2-year low of $0.8214 last week, while oil and iron ore <.IO62-CNI=SI> - Australia's top export earner - fell to a near 5-1/2 year low. "The biggest downside risk is if inflation makes a surprise comeback, bringing forward rate increases in the U.S., stopping rate cuts in Australia and raising the cost of debt around the world," Credit Suisse's Tevfik said.
