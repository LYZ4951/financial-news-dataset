ZURICH, Dec 17 (Reuters) - UBS <UBSG.VX> said on Wednesday it would  nominate Jes Staley, an executive at New York-based hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, to the board of the Swiss bank at its May shareholder meeting.

Staley is a former long-time executive of U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and one of a host of former bankers who have in recent years moved to roles in private equity, hedge funds and other more lightly regulated corners of high finance, broadly referred to as shadow banking.  "His professional expertise gained from three decades of working in several top leadership functions in global banking make him ideally suited to strengthen the board of UBS," Axel Weber, chairman of the Swiss bank, said in a statement.
