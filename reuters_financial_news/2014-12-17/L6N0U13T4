LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - European shares edged into positive territory on Wednesday, helped by a rebound in energy stocks and new signs that the European Central Bank will undertake measures to buoy the region's economy.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which had spent much of the day in negative territory, was up 0.2 percent at 1611 GMT, while the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> also rose 0.1 percent. Oil prices recovered some ground, with Brent higher at $60.60 per barrel and U.S. oil at $56.43. "If you're prepared to hold your nerve, oil assets look like a good buy at the moment," said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu.
