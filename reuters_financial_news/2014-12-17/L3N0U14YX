Dec 17 (Reuters) - The 500 million pounds (US$783.70 million) Barclays PLC <BARC.L> set aside to settle allegations of rigging the foreign exchange market would not be enough, the bank's Chief Executive Antony Jenkins said in an interview to Sky News.

"My expectation is it will be a bigger number than that," Jenkins replied when asked whether the amount would be enough. (http://bit.ly/1sG1hhi) The London-based bank pulled out of a settlement last month  because of complications with its New York-based regulator  Department of Financial Services, people familiar with the matter said.

He added that Barclays' bonus season would attract fewer headlines this season. "If a business performs, we'll pay; if it doesn't, we'll pay accordingly. It'll be much less controversial," Jenkins said in an interview to Sky News. Bank of England's regulatory arm said last month that it will scrutinise bonuses awarded to traders involved in attempts to manipulate the currency market. [ID:nL6N0T947X]
