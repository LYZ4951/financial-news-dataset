SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Australian shares rebounded from two-month lows on Wednesday, underpinned by a rally in energy and natural resources shares even as the market fretted over the currency crisis in Russia and tumbling oil prices.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> showed a rare gain of half a percent to 5,177.8 by 01:19 GMT, following six sessions of losses. Gains were broad-based with the energy sector the clear outperformer, showing a gain of 3 percent.  "It's a bit perplexing given the overnight action in oil prices," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. [O/R] He said the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting due later in the session was a possible reason for the move. "There may be some expectations of a short-circuiting of the pressure on commodity prices."  Whitehaven Coal <WHC.AX> leapt 5.2 percent to A$1.20, from 6-year lows touched recently, after the company said its first train with coal would leave the Maules Creek mine three months ahead of the original schedule. [ID:nWNAS00B10] Mining giants BHP Billiton <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> jumped more than 1 percent each. Also underpinning Australian shares was key chart support around 5,150, a level tested three times in as many sessions this week. McCarthy cited a series of major supports between 5,080 and 4,970. "We will need to see real pressure (to break these levels) and as we head into year-end, the risk is shifting to the upside," he said. New Zealand's benchmark NZX50 index <.NZ50> was fractionally firmer, up 2.9 points to 5,498.64, supported by solid demand for telecommunications retailer Spark <SPK.NZ>. Spark, the market's second biggest stock, was up 1.3 percent at NZ$3.10, with talk that the company will reaffirm on Thursday its investment in a new submarine cable between New Zealand and Australia. Other leading stocks were trading steadily, although the biggest company Fletcher Building <FBU.NZ> was at NZ$7.97, in sight of the 19-month low touched the previous session. Small-cap stocks <.NZSC> were positive, with payments technology company Smartpay <SPY.NZ> up 13.9 percent to NZ$0.20, albeit on slight volumes, after its Australian taxi payments company signed its first customer.
