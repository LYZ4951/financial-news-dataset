SAO PAULO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Brazilian billionaire Abilio Diniz has agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in Carrefour SA's <CARR.PA> Brazilian unit, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said on Wednesday.

Under terms of the deal, Diniz, whose Peninsula Participações holding company has been on an investment spree over the past 18 months, will pay between 500 million euros ($615 million) and 600 million euros ($738 million) for the stake, said the source, who requested anonymity because the talks are private.
