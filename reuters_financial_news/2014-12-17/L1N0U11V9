WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio criticized the Obama administration's decision on Wednesday to normalize relations with Cuba, saying the White House had gained little in a policy shift toward the communist-ruled nation.

"The White House has conceded everything, but gained little," Rubio, a Florida Republican who is Cuban-American, told reporters at a news conference.
