LISBON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Millennium bcp <BCP.LS>, Portugal's largest listed bank, said on Wednesday that new regulatory rules by the European Commission will cut its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 8 basis points due to its exposure to Angola.

The change happened as a consequence of the European Commission excluding Angola from a list of countries where regulatory rules are equivalent to the European Union's. The non-inclusion means "that the risk weights in accordance with the capital requirements regulation directive have to be applied instead, resulting in an increase of around 560 million euros in risk-weighted assets from Jan. 1, 2015," Millennium, which has a subsidiary in Angola, said in a statement. That increase resulted in a fall of 8 basis points in Millennium's common equity tier 1 fully-implemented capital ratio and a 15 basis point drop in its phased-in ratio. At the end of September, Millennium's common equity tier 1 capital ratio stood at 10.2 percent and its phased-in ratio was at 12.8 percent.  In October, Millennium failed in Europe-wide health checks that measured its end-2013 accounts, but said it has already taken measures in 2014 and does not need to raise capital or sell strategic assets.[ID:nL5N0SL0TQ] Millennium's smaller rival, Banco BPI <BBPI.LS>, said on Tuesday its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio would fall by a much steeper 90 basis points to 8.9 percent with the change to its Angolan exposure. Banco BPI controls Angola's largest bank BFA.
