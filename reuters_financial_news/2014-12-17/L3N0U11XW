BANGKOK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Thailand property developer Sansiri PCL <SIRI.BK> said on Wednesday it expected housing sales to rise about 8 to 10 percent in 2015 as the sector should recover in line with the country's improving economy.

The company is developing condominium projects worth a combined 30 billion baht ($908.82 million), which it aimed to book as revenue when the units are transferred to buyers over the next three years, Uthai Uthaisangsuk, Sansiri's senior executive vice-president for business development, told reporters.  Sales of the overall property sector are expected to rise 6-8 percent next year, he said, adding Sansiri's sales were below target as domestic political unrest prompted the company to delay launch of new condominium projects in 2014.
