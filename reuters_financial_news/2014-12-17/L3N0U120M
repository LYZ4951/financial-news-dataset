JAKARTA, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets traded mixed on Wednesday with Thai stocks rebounding from their lowest since June as the focus shifted to the central bank's policy rate meeting.

The SET Index <.SETI> rose 0.9 percent, after declining 8.5 percent in the past six sessions, giving investors attractive stocks valuations, analysts said. "The Thai market is on a technical rebound," said Teerada Charnyingyong, an analyst with Phillip Capital in Bangkok. "The focus has shifted to the rate meeting today. There are some hopes of an interest rate cut, which would be positive for the stock market," she added. Most economists surveyed by Reuters expect the interest rate to remain unchanged, but with inflation at a five-year low of 1.26 percent in November, some analysts said the Bank of Thailand had room to cut rates.
