MUMBAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - India's NSE index slumped more than 1 percent to below the psychologically key level of 8,000 points for the first time in 1-1/2 months on worries that financial contagion from Russia and slumping oil prices would lead foreign investors to shed risk assets.

Overseas investors sold shares worth 12.47 billion rupees ($196.56 mln) on Tuesday, their biggest daily net sales since Oct. 17, according to data from exchange NSE. [ID:nL3N0U11JA] ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> fell 2.8 percent, while Larsen and Toubro <LART.NS> lost 1.9 percent.
