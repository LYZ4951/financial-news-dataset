FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said on Wednesday that recent comments by the bank's president, Mario Draghi, had been interpreted in a "one-sided" manner.

ECB President Draghi said in a landmark speech at a central bank conference in Jackson Hole there was scope for governments use fiscal policies to help growth, which some observers saw as a departure from an earlier drive for austerity. "For me the main message was that structural reforms are the most important tool for a solution," Lautenschlaeger told a banking conference in Frankfurt.  She called the focus on more growth-friendly government spending "a very one-sided" interpretation of Draghi's speech. The euro zone economy ground to a hold in the second quarter and inflation hit 0.3 percent in August.  "In the current economic situation low interest rates are necessary," Lautenschlaeger said. "The economy is too weak to justify higher interest rates."
