MUMBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Indian shares extended a record-setting winning streak on Wednesday as software exporters such as Infosys Ltd <INFY.NS> rallied on strong U.S. economic data, while continued foreign buying and falling oil prices also helped the gains.

A fall in Brent crude <LCOc1> prices to 16-month lows and recent supportive economic data at home such as better-than-expected 5.7 percent GDP growth in April-June are also reinforcing investor optimism. The gains also tracked a rise in global stocks after Ukraine said it reached a ceasefire agreement with Russia, despite conflicting reports from the Kremlin. [MKTS/GLOB] Overseas investors continued to buy Indian stocks ahead of a crucial European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, which is widely expected to provide further stimulus for revival, thereby aiding liquidity in the financial markets. Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth 6.73 billion rupees ($111 million) on Tuesday, taking their total purchase to over $13 billion so far this year. "Political and economic changes have led to a positive trend in Indian equities which should continue. Also, India stands out in the world due to its strong domestic growth story," said Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance.
