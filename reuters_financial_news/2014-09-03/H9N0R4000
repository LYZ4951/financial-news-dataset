HONG KONG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Hang Kong's benchmark share index <.HSI> climbed more than 2 percent in afternoon trade on Wednesday, bolstered by stronger Chinese mainland markets after surveys showed activity in the country's service sector rebounded in August.

Afternoon gains pushed the Hang Seng Index to its highest since May 2008.
