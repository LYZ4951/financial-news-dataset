JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South African stocks followed major overseas markets higher on Wednesday, helping the main indices extend their winning streak to a third day.

Discovery <DSYJ.J> featured among the gainers after the country's largest health insurer posted a 24 percent rise in full-year profit. Shares in the company climbed 2.5 percent to 101.77 rand.  Overall, investors piled into equities on renewed risk appetite as optimism grew that a resolution would be reached between Ukraine and Russia. "The market has been driven by international events at the moment such as the talk of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, which takes a lot of pressure off the European economy," said Greg Katzenellenbogen, portfolio manager at Sanlam Private Wealth. The European Union is one of South Africa's main trading partners, and a drop in economic activity there tends to negatively affect local exporters. The JSE Top-40 index <.JTOPI> gained 0.67 percent to 46,387 and the broader All-share index <.JALSH> added 0.64 percent to 51,793. Mr Price <MPCJ.J> was up 1.7 percent at 208.88 after the retailer lifted four-month sales by 16 percent, bucking the slow trend in the sector as debt-laden consumers flocked to its no-frills outlets. On the downside, AngloGold Ashanti <ANGJ.J> and Gold Fields <GFIJ.J> fell between 1.4 percent and 2.2 percent as the price gold faltered.
