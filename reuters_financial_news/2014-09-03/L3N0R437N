THE GLOBE AND MAIL  * A new report is questioning the merits of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board's increasing use of "active" investments to boost returns.

Chan - the company's former chairman and chief executive - along with four other former Sino-Forest executives, face OSC allegations they committed fraud and misled investors in the company, which once had a market capitalization of C$6 billion and a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The publicly listed buyer will pay about C$12 million for the right to manage the funds. At C$12 million the purchase price - which will be paid mostly in cash but also in stock, works out to be about 3 percent of assets under management. (bit.ly/1sZ4FyS)
