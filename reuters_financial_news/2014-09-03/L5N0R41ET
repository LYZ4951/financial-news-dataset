LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Sterling recovered some ground against the dollar on Wednesday <GBP=D4> after a survey of purchasing managers (PMI) in the British economy's dominant service sector came in better than expected. [ID:nL9N0O502Q]

The pound, under renewed pressure this week after a survey showed Scotland's nationalists gaining ground in their bid to secure independence next month, had hit seven-month lows in Asian trading earlier on Wednesday.  Shortly after the PMI data, sterling was trading around 0.1 percent higher against the dollar at $1.6490. Against the euro it was roughly flat at 79.75 pence. <EURGBP=D4>
