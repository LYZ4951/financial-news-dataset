DUBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Waha Capital <WAHA.AD> has entered into a $575 million hedging deal on half of its stake in AerCap Holdings <AER.N>, the Emirati investment company said on Wednesday.

Waha will use the money to repay debt and fund new investments, according to a company statement to Abu Dhabi's bourse.  AerCap Holdings, in which Waha was its largest shareholder, bought American International Group's <AIG.N> aircraft leasing business in a $5.4 billion cash and share deal that was completed in May. This deal reduced Waha's stake in AerCap to 14.1 percent from 26.3 percent. [ID:nL6N0PX1QZ] The hedging agreement locks in the value of half the shares Waha owns in AerCap at a minimum $42.39 each, up to a maximum $61.23.
