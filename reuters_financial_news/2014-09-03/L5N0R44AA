LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A decision by Scotland to vote in favour of independence from the United Kingdom could have serious consequences for the Scottish and UK economies, Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Wednesday.

"Opinion polls suggest that the gap between the 'Yes' and the 'No' camps has narrowed but that a 'Yes' vote in favour of independence remains unlikely," Goldman Sachs' economist Kevin Daly wrote in the note. "In the event of a surprise 'Yes' vote, the near-term consequences for the Scottish economy, and for the UK more broadly, could be severely negative," he added. Daly also said that the threat of a break-up would investors with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets and withdraw deposits from Scottish based banks. He added that the Bank of England would be unable to credibly commit to a sterling <GBP=> currency union remaining unbroken in case of a "Yes" vote later this month.
