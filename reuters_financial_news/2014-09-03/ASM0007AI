LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - UK fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown <HRGV.L> posted a strong rise in full-year new business on Wednesday, thanks to buoyant equity market activity, and upped its total dividend by 8 percent.

The company said net new business rose 25 percent to 6.4 billion pounds ($10.54 billion) and it added 144,000 new clients in the year to end-June, helping boost total assets under administration by 29 percent to 46.9 billion. As a result, net revenue increased 8 percent to 291.9 million pounds and operating profit rose a similar amount to 208 million pounds. The margin on net revenue, however, dipped slightly to 71.3 percent from 71.5 percent in the previous year.
