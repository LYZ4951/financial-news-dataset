LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Investment banking and advisory firm Centerview Partners has recruited the former head of the body responsible for Britain's stakes in nationalised banks and a senior UBS <UBSN.VX> banker to boost its London presence.

Centerview said on Wednesday that Robin Budenberg, who advised the UK government on its bail-out of banks in 2008 and then served as CEO and chairman of UK Financial Investments (UKFI) - which held Britain's investments in RBS <RBS.L> and Lloyds <LLOY.L> - will join as chairman of Centerview London. Budenberg has spent most of his career at S.G. Warburg and UBS. Centerview said Nick Reid would also join as a partner from UBS, where he was co-head of the European business. He previously worked at Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Schroders.
