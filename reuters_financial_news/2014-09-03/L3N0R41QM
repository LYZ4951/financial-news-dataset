Sept 3 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

* The European Central Bank's negative rates strategy has not worked as planned, which is why it is under increasing pressure to try something else when it meets on Thursday. The central bank's so-called negative deposit rate has rippled through European markets, reinforced by fear that the eurozone economy is in decline and by nervousness about war, not only in Ukraine but also in the Middle East.

(http://nyti.ms/1q9xuKF)  * Dollar General Corp <DG.N> is willing to pay more to win the bidding war over Family Dollar Stores Inc <FDO.N>. And its takeover effort could go hostile if Family Dollar does not begin sale negotiations. Dollar General offered on Tuesday to raise its bid for Family Dollar to $9.1 billion after the rejection of an earlier offer that would have beaten a rival $8.5 billion deal with Dollar Tree, agreed to in late July.

The company said it was working with law enforcement authorities and banks on the matter. (http://nyti.ms/1vLmkyU)
