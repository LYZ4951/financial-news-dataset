Sept 3 (Reuters) - Automakers reported a 5.5 percent rise in U.S. sales in August from a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales rose to 17.53 million vehicles from 15.94 million a year earlier.

The annualized rate is followed by economists and is calculated using seasonal factors supplied by the U.S. Commerce Department that account for sales from vehicles produced in North America or overseas.INDUSTRY TOTALS   Aug-14Aug-13   PCT CHNG   Total industry   1,586,015 1,503,1515.5   Total car  767,190   751,5402.1   Total truck818,825   751,6118.9   Domestic car   558,159   525,0386.3   Domestic truck 705,635   644,3109.5   Import car 209,031   226,502   -7.7   Import truck   113,190   107,3015.5   YTD-14YTD-13PCT CHG   Total industry  11,185,29910,647,4865.1   Total car5,466,399 5,402,3471.2   Total truck  5,718,900 5,245,1399.0   Domestic car 3,916,004 3,858,0411.5   Domestic truck   4,995,361 4,522,347   10.5   Import car   1,550,395 1,544,3060.4   Import truck   723,539   722,7920.1  U.S. seasonally adjusted annualized sales (millions)
