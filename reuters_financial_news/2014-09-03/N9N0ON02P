BRASILIA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Activity in Brazil's services sector shrank in August for the first time since January and at the quickest pace in two years, a private survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting Latin America's biggest economy may remain stuck in a recession.

HSBC's Purchasing Managers Index for Brazilian services <BRPMIS=ECI> dropped on a seasonally adjusted basis to 49.2 in August from 50.2 in July. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction. The drop offset a small increase in manufacturing activity in the month. As a result, HSBC's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> for the country stayed at 49.6 in August, from 49.3 in July. Brazil's economy slipped into recession in the first half of the year as investment dropped sharply. Services companies had escaped the brunt of Brazil's economic downturn in recent years as low unemployment fueled consumption, but the PMI survey adds to recent signs of a broad weakness in Latin America's largest country.

"It suggests the continuation of a challenging scenario for activity in the second half of the year."
