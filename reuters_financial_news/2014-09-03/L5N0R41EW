LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russian dollar bonds rallied on Wednesday after Ukraine said an agrement had been reached with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a "permanent ceasefire" in its eastern, Donbass region.

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said the deal had been reached after the two leaders spoke by telephone. The 2030 dollar bond rose almost 2 cents on the dollar to 112.75 <US78307ACZ4=TE> while the 2043 issue also jumped by a similar amount <US78307ADH3=TE>.
