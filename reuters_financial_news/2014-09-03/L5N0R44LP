LISBON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Foreign investors, mainly from North America and Britain, bought  94 percent of Portugal's new 15-year bond on Wednesday, the country's debt agency IGCP said after pricing 3.5 billion euros (4.60 billion US dollar) in February 2030 bonds.

It said that with the issue - Portugal's first euro-denominated syndication since exiting an international bailout in May - the country has pre-funded some 2015 financing needs after meeting this year's financing gaols.  "The final order book was close to 9 billion euros via over 270 accounts... The transaction enjoyed particularly strong take-up from international real money investors, demonstrating widespread demand for Portugal in the capital markets," the IGCP said in a statement.
