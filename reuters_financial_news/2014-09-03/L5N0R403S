Sept 3 (Reuters) - Malaysia's Bank Muamalat [BUKHCM.UL] and Bank of London and The Middle East (BLME) <BLME.DI> will develop Islamic private banking services in the southeast Asian country to widen the banks' business lines.

BLME, Britain's largest Islamic bank, is aiming to diversify its revenue streams with a focus on its corporate banking and wealth management divisions, while Bank Muamalat's has limited private banking products. Under the agreement, BLME will help develop sharia-compliant banking products for the Malaysian market aimed at high net worth individuals, the bank said in a statement late on Tuesday. "With wealth management continuing to be a strategic priority for BLME, this partnership was the natural next step," said chief executive Humphrey Percy. Bank Muamalat, owned by sovereign fund Khazanah and auto-to-property conglomerate DRB-Hicom Bhd <DRBM.KL>, said the Islamic private banking platform could be ready within a year. The agreement marks the firs foray in Asia for BLME, although a bank spokeswoman said there were no plans to apply for a banking license in Malaysia.
