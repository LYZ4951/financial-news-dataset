HONG KONG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index made its largest daily gain in 9-1/2 months on Wednesday to close at its highest level since May 2008, while China's onshore markets took heart from upbeat results of two surveys on service sector activity.

The services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit jumped to 54.1 in August - the strongest in 17 months - from a nine-year low of 50.0 in July, while the official non-manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 from July's six-month low.
