BERLIN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Europe's biggest online fashion player Zalando announced plans on Wednesday to list a stake in the business on the Frankfurt stock exchange this year, hoping to raise hundreds of millions of euros to help fund further expansion.

Zalando, which unveiled a new advertising campaign, website, packaging and apps last week at its first-ever news conference, wants to list a stake of 10-11 percent that could value the company at about 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in one of Germany's biggest tech flotations for years. [ID:nL5N0QY0SR] The listing comes amid a flurry of e-commerce flotations this year, with Chinese giant Alibaba <IPO-ALIB.N> set to list this month as well as German venture capital firm Rocket Internet which helped launch Zalando and many other start-ups.
