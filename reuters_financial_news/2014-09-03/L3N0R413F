HONG KONG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China shares rose for a fourth straight day on Wednesday, spurred by two surveys showing activity in China's services sector rebounded in August after a drop in July, pushing the major indexes to multi-month highs.

The Hong Kong market followed suit, with its benchmark index scoring the best rise in six weeks.  The services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit jumped to 54.1 in August - the strongest in 17 months - from a nine-year low of 50.0 in July, while the official non-manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4 from July's six-month low. [ID:nL3N0R40EO] By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI>, which had ended the previous three sessions flat, was up 1.3 percent at 25,077.46 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 1.9 percent.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings added 0.7 percent to its highest since mid-December, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> climbed 0.6 percent to 2,279.29 points, a 15-month high. Liu Jingde, analyst at Cinda Securities in Beijing, said the rises of the past few days can be seen as the beginning of another rally after a consolidation. "With the economy being stable, though not obviously improved, the recent gains of the indexes are just a recovery after falling for so many years," Liu said.  Blue-chips were broadly stronger, including the recently beaten down coal and property companies.  Yanzhou Coal Mining <600188.SS> <1171.HK> jumped 6.4 percent in Shanghai and 3.3 percent in Hong Kong. China Vanke <000002.SZ>, Poly Real Estate <600048.SS> and China Merchant Property Development <000024.SZ> all added more than 1 percent, though the services surveys showed a cooling property sector remained a drag on the economy. "There are still fears in the market about a crash in China's growth and a property market collapse," said Laura Luo, head of Hong Kong and China equities at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Limited, at a briefing on Tuesday.  "In my view, China is a re-rating story and the country is undergoing unprecedented structural reforms which may cause short-term pains but will lead to long term gains."  Smaller banks also outperformed after mainland media reported on progress with an employee stock ownership plan in financial firms, quoting a senior official from the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Bank of Beijing <601169.SS> climbed 3.2 percent and China Merchants Bank <600036.SS> 0.8 percent.
