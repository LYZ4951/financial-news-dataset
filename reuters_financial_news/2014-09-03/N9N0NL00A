NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages rose last week as interest rates declined, an industry group said on Wednesday.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose 0.2 percent in the week ended Aug. 29. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose 1.4 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 1.5 percent.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. mortgage data:  http://link.reuters.com/guv37s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  Fixed 30-year mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since June 2013, averaging 4.25 percent in the week, down 3 basis points from 4.28 percent the week before.
