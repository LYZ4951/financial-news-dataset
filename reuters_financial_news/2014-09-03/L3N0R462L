SYDNEY, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to inch up on Thursday after Ukraine and Russia took steps toward a ceasefire, but miners are likely to cap gains as iron ore prices fell to a near five-year low.

Investors will watch for data on retail sales and trade balance later in the day.  * Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> were unchanged at 5,640.0 to sit at a 7-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>. The benchmark closed nearly steady on Wednesday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was barely changed at 5,224.97 points. * U.S. stocks ended mostly down on Wednesday, as a decline in Apple shares dragged the Nasdaq lower and investors held off on big bets before the European Central Bank's upcoming policy meeting. * Nickel prices jumped to a four-week high on Wednesday on news that a Philippine senator had urged a ban on unprocessed mineral ore exports and following an options expiry in London. * Iron ore prices <.IO62-CNI=SI> fell overnight to $85.70, a near five-year low. * Shares of Recall Holdings Ltd <REC.AX> will likely rise after it entered into an agreement to sell its secure destruction services business in Germany. [ID:nASB08SHD] * Fortescue Metals Group Ltd <FMG.AX> reported its August iron ore shipments rose to a record.
