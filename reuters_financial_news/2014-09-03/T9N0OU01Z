TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japan's newly appointed health minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki said on Wednesday that he wants to accelerate efforts to reform governance of the country's $1.26 trillion public fund, the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF).

Shiozaki, 63, a proponent of an overhaul of GPIF, said the public fund must diversify its assets away from government debt,  although the details of asset allocation should be left up to experts to decide. His ministry oversees GPIF.
