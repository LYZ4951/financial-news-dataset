May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Investitionsbank  Schleswig-Holstein (IB-SH) a Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AAA',  Short-term IDR of 'F1+', Support Rating (SR) of '1' and Support Rating Floor  (SRF) of 'AAA'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR is Stable. A full list of  rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, SR and SRF  IB-SH's Long-Term IDR is equalised with that of its guarantor, the State of  Schleswig-Holstein (State of SH; AAA/Stable). IB-SH is covered by a maintenance  obligation (Anstaltslast) and an explicit guarantee obligation and a statutory  guarantor's liability (Gewaehrtraegerhaftung). State of SH's creditworthiness is  underpinned by the strength of the German solidarity system, which links its  creditworthiness to that of the Federal Republic of Germany (see "Institutional  Framework for German Subnationals", dated April 2008 at www.fitchratings.com).  The bank's SR is based on this formalised support but also reflects the role  that the bank fulfils for the State of SH. IB-SH's mandate to provide  promotional and development funding is outlined in the Law Concerning IB-SH  (Investitionsbankgesetz) and its statutes. IB-SH provides funding for economic,  social, municipal, infrastructure, environmental and affordable and energy  efficient real estate lending in the State of SH. In addition, IB-SH takes on  special tasks if requested by the State of SH, for example the management and  distribution of European development funds.   Fitch does not assign a Viability Rating to IB-SH as its business models are  strongly linked to and dependent upon support from its state guarantor.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, SR and SRF The bank's IDRs are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions around owner's  support, specifically a downgrade of Germany or the State of SH, or a change in  the terms of the state guarantees. Fitch does not consider any of these  scenarios likely in the foreseeable future.  The Stable Outlook on the bank's ratings reflects Fitch view that the nature of  the state support is unlikely to change significantly in the medium term due to  the strategic importance of IB-SH to the SH economy and their entrenchment in  the regional financial system. The support structure was approved by the  European Union in 2002 and under competition law the bank may only engage in  non-competitive activity. This also makes significant changes to the bank's  business model unlikely in the medium term.As part of its 26 March review of state support for banks globally, Fitch  maintained Stable Outlooks on Long-term IDRs of banks that fulfil a specific  policy function with state guarantees for all liabilities and/or solvency  guarantees, like IB-SH (for further information, see bank-specific Rating Action  Commentaries and Rating Action Reports at www.fitchratings.com).  For German development banks that benefit from guarantees from their Bundesland,  including IB-SH, Fitch plans to switch the source of support it considers from  systemic to institutional, most likely later in 2014 or in 1H15. This means that  they will no longer have a SRF. This technical change means that Fitch will be  looking directly to the federal state for its assessment of support rather than  to Germany. It has no effect on IB-SH's IDR given that Fitch assesses all 16  German Bundeslaender (federal states) to have 'AAA' creditworthiness.   The rating actions are as follows:  Investitionsbank Schleswig-Holstein  Long-term IDR assigned at 'AAA', Stable Outlook Short-term IDR assigned at 'F1+' Support Rating assigned at '1'
