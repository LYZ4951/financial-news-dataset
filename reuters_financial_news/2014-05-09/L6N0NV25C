MUNICH, May 9 (Reuters) - German premium auto maker Audi <VOWG_p.DE> wants to expand its product range of large vehicles and may develop an extra large sports utility vehicle to be positioned above its Q7 model, Chief Executive Rupert Stadler said.

"We want to expand the upper segment," Stadler told journalists at an event late on Thursday. "We are discussing a Q8." Stadler's remarks come shortly after rival BMW <BMWG.DE> unveiled plans to build a new X7 sports utility vehicle in response to customer demand for an offroader with three rows of seats.
