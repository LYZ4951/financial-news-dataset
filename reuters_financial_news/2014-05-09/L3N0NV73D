May 9 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service raised its credit rating on Portugal's government bond on Friday to "Ba2" from "Ba3", citing the country's rapidly improving fiscal situation.

"Moody's expects the public debt ratio to decline this year for the first time in many years, albeit from a very high level of close to 130% of GDP," Moody's said in a statement. (http://r.reuters.com/kuw29v)
