ZURICH, May 9 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse won a narrow vote to issue new shares for staff bonuses at the Swiss bank's annual general meeting on Friday, with nearly 30 percent of investors opposing the move.

More than 67 percent of the Swiss bank's shareholders backed the proposal, which required a two-thirds majority to pass.
