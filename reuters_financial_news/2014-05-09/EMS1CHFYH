NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended May 7 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $10.8 billion to $1.042 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $26.4 billion to $1.093 trillion.
