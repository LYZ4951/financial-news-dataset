May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Italian toll road  operator Sias S.p.A. <SIS.MI> (Sias) a Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB+'  with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also assigned the following ratings to SIAS's  euro medium-term notes (EMTN) programme and notes:   EMTN programme of EUR2bn (senior secured notes): 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable EMTN programme of EUR2bn (senior unsecured notes): 'BBB'; Outlook Stable EUR500m senior secured notes due October 2020: 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable EUR500m senior secured notes due February 2024: 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable The rating reflects a combination of a Midrange asset (resistant and large toll  road network benefitting from a generally protective concession framework),  robust although complex debt structure and moderate leverage (maximum 4x, Fitch  calculation).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Sias is the second-largest Italian toll road operator managing a network of  1,175 km (20% nationally), which is critical for the mobility of the wealthy  north-west region of Italy (GDP per capita around 18% above the national/EU  average). Traffic was resistant through the 2008-2011 crisis (maximum 1.2%  decline) but experienced a shock in 2012 (-7.7%) due to the decrease of domestic  consumption as a response to austerity measures. Traffic moderately contracted  again in 2013 (-2.2% like for like) but 1Q14 figures shows sign of  stabilisation.  Under Fitch's rating case, traffic will drop by 1.6% in 2014 and remain subdued  thereafter. Downside risk mainly stems from the still evolving Italian economy  and its impact on traffic dynamics. The reduction in overall traffic as a result  of the expiry of three concessions by 2021 is not expected to result in greater  volatility of its traffic performance for the residual network compared to the  status quo. Volume Risk is assessed as Midrange. Tariff hikes of 4.6% (like for like) in 2014 are expected to largely outpace the  assumed traffic decline. The concession framework is robust as it links tariff  hikes to capex execution thus partially de-linking group cash flow generation  from negative traffic performances. However, some uncertainty remains around the  possible political response to the sharp toll increases that the capex plan, if  realised, would trigger (especially for those concessions with a short  maturity). The balance gives a midrange assessment for Price Risk.  Sias will face an ambitious capex programme (of EUR1.6bn in 2014-2017) as  required by the updated concessionaries business plans, once approved. The  execution of these plans remains a major driver for achieving yield on  investments that will significantly increase tariffs. Sias has long-standing  experience and in-house expertise in delivering investment on its network and  this supports a Stronger assessment for the infrastructure development and  renewal risk factor. Sias is involved jointly with Banca Intesa (BBB+/Negative) in the development of  Tangenziale Esterna (TE) and Brebemi, two large greenfields toll road projects  in the Milan area. Both are financed with non-recourse debt under project  finance schemes. Brebemi is at an advanced stage of execution while TE will be  delivered in two different stages (mid-2014 and 2015). This results in some  execution risk that may imply higher than expected financial support from  shareholders. Under the rating case, EUR100m was added to the  equity/subordinated loans Sias has already committed to inject in Tangenziale  Est Esterna di Milano and in TE (EUR125m already included in 2013 Fitch adjusted  leverage).  Sias should be able to substantially self-finance its direct and indirect  2014-2017 investment plan. Under Fitch's rating case, which uses lower  assumptions on traffic, opex, cost of debt and dividends compared with the  sponsor's case, leverage of 3.9x is forecast to progressively reduce to 3.5x by  2016 and further decrease thereafter. Since three key group concessions  (accounting for 50% of EBITDA) mature by 2021, Fitch also ran a longer forecast  exercise up to 2022. Under this extended rating case, which also assumes that  the terminal value of expiring concessions will be distributed to shareholders,  leverage calculated on the residual EBITDA is expected to remain below 4x in  2022. Under this scenario, weaker traffic performance or higher than expected  operating costs could be absorbed by the reduction of dividend distribution,  which Fitch assumed at a level that is on average 2.3x above the historical  ordinary group dividend distribution (EUR70m). In addition, if tariffs do not  increase as expected, the capex plan could be adjusted downwards. Sias's debt consists of a balanced mix of amortising (46%) and bullet (54%)  instruments mostly at fixed rates (82%). Sias is not a frequent issuer in the  capital market (three bonds are outstanding, one of which is convertible) but  has well-established relationships with a diversified network of national and  international banks (including EIB). Refinancing risk is mitigated by a sound  liquidity position, which under Fitch's rating case covers debt maturities until  2017. Debt structure is assessed as Midrange. Debt is split between Holdco (Sias 60%) and Opcos (40%) although the  centralisation and diversification of group funding structure is ongoing. To  this end, in 2010, Sias established a EUR2bn EMTN programme. The programme  documentation contains a negative pledge at Sias and subsidiaries levels (with  carve outs) and put event (with carve outs) in case of concession events or  reduced stake in a material subsidiary. The EMTN programme does not include  financial covenants, although bondholders indirectly benefit from default  covenants included in a diversified pool of bank loans contracted by Sias and  Opcos. Fitch gives limited credit to the bank covenants since the bank loans may  be prepaid. Bonds under the EMTN programme can be unsecured or secured. The unsecured notes  constitute direct, general and unconditional obligation of the issuer, which at  all times rank pari passu among themselves and at least pari passu with all  other present and future unsecured obligation of the issuer. Senior secured  notes benefit from first ranking security over the Holdco-Opco intercompany  loans. In a pre-enforcement scenario, payments under these intercompany loans  may be used to services Sias's secured and unsecured debt. The programme also  contains a provision that gives Sias the option to convert secured bonds into  unsecured when 85% of group consolidated debt is at the Holdco level. Secured  and unsecured notes both have the benefit of cross-default/cross acceleration  clauses (with EUR50m threshold) with other Sias debt and debt raised at Opcos  level. Under this structure, in case of acceleration/default at parent/material  subsidiary levels, Sias's secured creditors would be entitled to enforce their  security and directly collect receivable arising from the pledged intercompany  loans. An inter-creditor agreement ensures that enforcement proceeds are shared  pro-quota and pari-passu among all Sias's secured creditors (bondholders and  other secured creditors).   As intercompany loans are reasonably well spread among all group subsidiaries,  the above mechanism gives Sias's secured creditors access to asset and cash  flows of all the group's operating subsidiaries. This structure results in  Sias's secured creditors ranking pari-passu with the senior unsecured creditors  of Opcos and supports a rating of the senior secured notes in line with our  assessment of the group's consolidated financial profile. Conversely, senior  unsecured notes, which could be issued under the EUR2bn EMTN programme, will be  rated one notch below the group's consolidated financial profile because the  lack of pledge over the intercompany loans makes the unsecured notes  contractually subordinated to Sias's senior secured creditors and structurally  subordinated to creditors of Opcos.  The most comparable peers to Sias in Fitch's EMEA rating portfolio are Atlantia <ATL.MI> (A-/Negative), Abertis (BBB+/Negative), Milano Serravalle (BBB-/Negative) and  Brisa (BBB/Negative). Sias has performed in line with its Italian peers and  better than its international peers in terms of traffic performances. However,  Sias suffers from relatively shorter remaining average concession maturity  (similar to Abertis) and more complex group and debt structures According to our rating criteria, an average DSCR of 1.5x under Fitch's rating  case would be compatible with a 'A' category rating for assets with established  operating history (i.e. demonstrated resilience) and high tariff flexibility.  Sias's 'BBB+' senior secured rating reflects mostly Midrange key rating drivers  assessments, average and minimum rating case DSCR of 1.5x and 1.3x,  respectively, as calculated up to 2022, and moderate Fitch-adjusted leverage of  3.5x. The credit profile is weighed down by the short concessions maturity and  complex group and financial structures.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating could be downgraded if financial performance deteriorates, with  Fitch-adjusted leverage expected to consistently exceed 4.5x over a three-year  horizon. An austerity related decision made by the Italian government, such as change in  taxation, prolonged freeze in toll rate increase or any other measure materially  affecting group free cash flow generation, if not compensated, could adversely  impact Sias's credit profile.  The short-term horizon of the rating case envisages a 1.6% traffic decline for  2014 and flat (0%) volumes for 2015. A sharper or sustained decline of the  Italian economy impacting traffic forecasts could prompt a negative rating  action. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity to cover group investments and debt  service requirement needs would prompt a negative rating action as would any  extraordinary dividend distribution materially affecting the group's liquidity  position or projected debt leverage metrics (net debt/EBITDA).  The current debt at TE/BREBEMI is without recourse to Sias. Any change to this  implying Sias's direct or indirect responsibility for this debt could be rating  negative.  Sias's ratings are not capped by the sovereign rating of Italy (BBB+/Stable) and  would not be automatically affected by a sovereign rating action. However, a  material deterioration in the sovereign's credit quality or a sovereign rating  action caused by a deterioration of the domestic economic environment could  prompt a rating review.
