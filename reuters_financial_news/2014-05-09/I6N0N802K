MILAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Banca Popolare di Milano (BPM) <PMII.MI> posted on Friday a 12 percent rise in first-quarter net profit helped by higher interest income.

The bank, which is carrying out a 500 million euro rights issue to strengthen its capital base, said that its best-quality Common Equity Tier 1 ratio stood at 7.3 percent at the end of March. That compares with an 8 percent threshold set by the European Central Bank in a review of banks across the euro zone. The bank expects the rights issue to help boost its Common Equity capital to around 11 percent.
