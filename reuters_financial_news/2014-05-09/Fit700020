May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that Barclays plc's [BARC.L] (A/Stable/a)  announcement that it plans to substantially reduce the size of its investment  bank and concentrate on its core franchises should result in a more stable  company profile. The bank announced that it plans to allocate no more than 30%  of risk-weighted assets (RWA) to the investment bank. The strategy update  follows the investment bank's weak performance in 1Q14, when the bank's fixed  income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business underperformed many peers.  Fitch views execution of the strategy without damaging the 'core' parts of the  investment bank that are being retained as being key. The announcement in itself  has no impact on the bank's ratings. However, the bank's modestly higher  fully-applied Basel III common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio target (at least 11%),  the reduction in leverage that will ensue (revised target of at least 4%  leverage ratio) and the more stable and higher earnings profile that should  follow are positive  developments. For this improvement to be realised, the bank  will have to materially reduce the legacy and non-core assets transferred into a  non-core unit to reduce earnings drag from these assets and reduce operating  costs as planned.  Barclays announced on 8 May that it intends to concentrate on four core  businesses, personal and corporate banking, credit cards, African banking and  investment banking. As part of its strategy update, Barclays announced the  creation of a non-core unit, which will hold about GBP115bn RWA (GBP400bn  leverage exposure). These include GBP59bn RWA already defined as 'exit quadrant  assets' under the bank's previous strategic plan. A large proportion (GBP90bn)  will be transferred from the investment bank and will include non-standard fixed  income derivatives, the bulk of the group's commodities business and emerging  markets products. The non-core unit will also comprise the group's entire  European retail business, which it plans to exit completely. The bank's core investment bank will concentrate on its core franchises in the  UK and US in equities and credit in both origination and trading. Macro trading  businesses will be focused on shorter-term centrally-cleared and collateralised  transactions and foreign exchange. As a result, the remaining investment bank  will operate with about GBP120bn RWA by 2016, down from GBP222bn at end-2013.  The material reduction in balance-sheet intensive rates businesses will also  reduce leverage exposure by about 53% by 2016.  We believe that the bank's greater focus on shorter-term transactions in fixed  income should reduce earnings volatility and lead to cost savings if  transactions are processed on a small number of platforms. In 1Q14, the  investment bank posted a 49% yoy drop in pre-tax profit to GBP668m, mainly as a  result of a 41% decline in FICC trading revenue. This decline was sharper than  at most peers, partly because the bank initiated its repositioning in macro  businesses during the quarter. The drop also highlights the relative importance  of macro businesses, which performed weakly in the quarter for all peers,  including Barclays. As part of its strategy update, Barclays announced that its UK retail and  corporate banking business and its wealth management will be combined under one  division. Putting the two divisions together should help the bank prepare for  establishing a ring-fenced entity in the UK as required under domestic  legislation, but details on the final regulations have not yet been announced.  Personal and corporate banking will operate with about GBP120bn RWA and should  continue to benefit from its strong retail mortgage and corporate franchise in  the UK. In 1Q14, the bank's retail and domestic corporate business performed  well as the UK retail business reported GBP360m pre-tax profit, up 20% yoy,  mainly on the back of lending growth and lower loan impairment charges. We  expect Barclays' UK business to continue its healthy performance in an improved  operating environment, and cost savings from the simplification of product  offerings and increased direct channels should further help underpin  performance. Barclaycard continued to perform well in 1Q14 and reported a 17% increase in  pre-tax profit to GBP423m helped by cost control, lending growth and modest loan  impairment charges and the bank plans further growth in this business, where  Barclays has strong franchises in several countries and sees scope for expanding  activities further. Barclays' Africa banking business, which operates with about GBP40bn RWA at  end-2013, is expected to see further growth as the bank plans to concentrate in  its main franchises in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Botswana and Zambia. In 1Q14,  Africa retail and business banking generated GBP101m pre-tax profit, up 25% yoy.  The increase would have been higher at 75% excluding the effect of the sharp  depreciation of the ZAR as lower loan impairment charges and a 13% decline in  operating costs compensated for a 15% decline in reported net revenue caused by  currency movements.  Assets in the new non-core unit will include a high proportion of former  investment banking assets, which the bank intends to materially reduce together  with the non-core assets from other divisions. During 2014, the bank plans to  reduce RWA in the unit by about 30% to GBP80bn, with a further reduction to  GBP50bn by 2016. The group's earnings will be affected by low income and  operating expenses related to managing these assets, and the bank will have to  demonstrate that it can hedge positions adequately to avoid material earnings  volatility or losses in the unit, which the bank currently does not expect. A  material asset reduction in the unit will help the bank achieve its  capitalisation targets and should enable it to reduce operating expenses  further.
