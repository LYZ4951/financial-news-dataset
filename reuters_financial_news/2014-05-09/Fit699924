May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' new business plan will help  tackle the key challenges the group faces but execution risks are high and the  financial targets are ambitious, Fitch Ratings says. The plan to reposition key brands and increase global market shares through a  strong product offensive, notably at Jeep and Alfa Romeo, would help counter the  weakness of the European car market and continuing competitive pressures. It  would also increase production to lower overcapacity. However, this is not the first attempt to rejuvenate Alfa Romeo and the track  record has been poor, with several failed attempts. Given the challenges FCA  will face, such as weak demand and a poor macroeconomic environment in some  markets, strong product pipelines from various competitors, and the time it  takes to change customers' view of a brand, we believe the 2018 market-share  targets are ambitious. These include growing its US market share to 15.8% from  11.4% in 2013 and significantly increasing its Chinese market share to 2.8% from  0.6%. Targets to significantly boost cash generation and cut reported consolidated net  debt to less than EUR1bn in 2018 from nearly EUR10bn in 2013 (pro-forma after  the acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in Chrysler and  retrospective application of IFRS 11) will be equally tough. They are also  largely reliant on substantial working capital (WC) inflows for which details  have not been provided. In particular, we believe that WC inflows will be highly  dependent on revenue growing in line with targets. FCA's announcement does not affect our 'BB-'/Negative Fiat rating because there  is no near-term structural change in the business profile and achieving the  group's 2018 targets will depend on execution. Poor operating margins, notably  in North America and Latin America, and negative free cash flow in the group's  weak first-quarter results highlight the low starting point for the business  plan. The group announced that its plan did not include any capital increase, although  it was not completely ruled out, and no asset disposal. A mandatory convertible  is currently not on the agenda either.
