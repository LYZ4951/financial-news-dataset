May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the guaranteed  public sector Pfandbriefe issued by Bayerische Landesbank <BLGGgi.F> (A+/Negative/F1+), the  guaranteed mortgage and public sector Pfandbriefe issued by HSH Nordbank AG [HSH.UL] (A-/Negative/F1) , Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg (A+/Negative/F1+) and  Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen Girozentrale <LHTGg.F> (A+/Stable/F1+), and the public sector  Pfandbriefe issued by NRW.BANK [LANNWB.UL] (AAA/Stable/F1+) at 'AAA' with Stable Outlooks.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of the Landesbanks' guaranteed Pfandbriefe are based on the scope of  the guarantee (Gewaehrtraegerhaftung) provided by the respective German regional  states (Laender) of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hamburg, Hesse,  Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia. They are also driven by the credit quality of  the states, which in Fitch's view, is underpinned by the stability of the German  solidarity system linking their creditworthiness to that of the Federal Republic  of Germany (AAA/Stable/F1+). The guarantee applies to bonds issued before 18  July 2001 and to bonds issued between 19 July 2001 and 18 July 2005, but  maturing no later than 31 December 2015.  The rating of NRW.BANK's public sector Pfandbriefe is driven by its Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'AAA'.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' ratings of HSH Nordbank's guaranteed public sector and mortgage  Pfandbriefe and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg's guaranteed mortgage Pfandbriefe  would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the German sovereign's IDR was downgraded  to 'AA+' or below.  The 'AAA' ratings of Bayerische Landesbank's guaranteed public sector  Pfandbriefe, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg's guaranteed public sector  Pfandbriefe and Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen Girozentrale's guaranteed public  sector and mortgage Pfandbriefe would be vulnerable to a downgrade, if both of  the following occurred: the German sovereign's IDR was downgraded to 'AA+' or  below, and the ratings of the unguaranteed Pfandbriefe cross-collateralised with  the guaranteed Pfandbriefe were downgraded to 'AA+' or below.
