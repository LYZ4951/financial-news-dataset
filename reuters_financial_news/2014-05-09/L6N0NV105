NAIROBI, May 9 (Reuters) - Barclays Bank Kenya <BBK.NR> said on Friday its pretax profit for first quarter 2014 rose 16 percent to 2.84 billion shillings ($32.6 million), helped by growth in its interest income.

The bank, a unit of Barclays Plc <BARC.L>, said in a statement its net interest income - total interest minus interest expenses - rose to 4.76 billion shillings from 4.52 billion shillings, driven by higher lending to customers.
