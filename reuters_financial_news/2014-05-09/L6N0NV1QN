STOCKHOLM, May 9 (Reuters) - Swedish builder Skanska's <SKAb.ST> U.S. Civil unit, which builds large infrastructure projects like roads and tunnels, is expected to receive big orders during 2014, Skanska's Chief Executive Johan Karlstrom said on Friday.

The company's overall construction orders grew by 33 percent in the first quarter to 32.5 billion Swedish crowns ($5.00 billion), compared with a mean forecast for 28.9 billion crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts.  Skanska's order intake was particularly strong in the U.S. Building unit, helped by increased demand for commercial buildings, healthcare, airports and IT facilities, whereas orders for U.S. Civil decreased. However, a strong demand for new infrastructure in the United States will help U.S. Civil going forward, the company said. "I feel very confident that we will fill up orders in U.S. Civil during the year. There are many large incoming projects," Karlstrom told Reuters. One of these is the newly announced Interstate 4 Ultimate in Florida, but according to Karlstrom there are other projects as well. Skanska estimates that U.S. Civil's contract for Interstate 4 will amount to around 6 billion Swedish crowns when a final deal is signed, which is expected to happen during the second half of 2014, the company said in its earnings report.  In Europe the builder sees positive signals from several markets, among them Poland, Great Britain and Norway where government spending on infrastructure is seen underpinning demand. "We see that the European markets continue their positive development going forward," Karlstrom said. Skanska's order intake was 21 percent higher than revenues in the first quarter. On a rolling twelve month basis order intake was on par with revenues after previously having been lower than revenues. [ID:nL6N0NV1BJ] "We are clearly in an uptrend", Karlstrom said.
