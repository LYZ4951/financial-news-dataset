BANGKOK, May 9 (Reuters) - Philippine shares rose to their highest in 11 months on Friday as market cheered the surprise Standard & Poor's credit rating upgrade, while Thai stocks suffered their worst weekly drop in 19 weeks as the political stalemate hurt investor sentiment.

The Philippine main index <.PSI> was up 1.2 percent, ending the week up 1.6 percent, a seventh consecutive week. The market rally took its year to date gain to 14.8 percent in terms of local currency, Asia's best performing market. S&P raised the Philippines' credit rating to two notches above investment grade, the first debt watcher to do so, saying reforms are likely to continue beyond the administration of President Benigno Aquino. The report came late on Thursday.[ID:nL3N0NU4R1] Philippine bourse recorded a net foreign inflow of 758 million peso ($17.2 million) on the day, the biggest in more than one week, according to Thomson Reuters and stock exchange data.
