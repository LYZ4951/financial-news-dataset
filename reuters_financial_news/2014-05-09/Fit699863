May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based Bharti  Airtel Limited's <BRTI.NS> (Bharti) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB-'. Also, Fitch has assigned Bharti Airtel  International (Netherlands) B.V's 3% CHF350m senior unsecured guaranteed notes  due 2020 a final rating of 'BBB-'.  The final rating on the notes follows the receipt of documents conforming to  information already received, and is in line with the expected rating assigned  on 13 March 2014. Bharti will use all the proceeds from the notes issue to  refinance its existing debt. The agency has also affirmed the ratings on Bharti  Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V's following instruments:   - 5.125% USD1.5bn guaranteed senior unsecured notes due 2023 at 'BBB-' - 4% EUR1bn guaranteed senior unsecured notes due 2018 at 'BBB-'  KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Ratings Headroom: Bharti's 'BBB-' ratings would not be able to withstand  significant debt-funded acquisitions or higher-than-expected regulatory costs as  its funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage will be around  2.3x-2.5x for the financial year ending March 2015 (FY14: 2.5x, excluding unpaid  spectrum costs) - close to 2.5x, the level above which Fitch may consider  negative rating action. Nevertheless, Fitch expects Bharti to generate at least  INR35bn-40bn (USD580m-670m) in FCF - despite higher capex/revenue of 18%-19% -  as competition eases in its Indian operations and margins stabilise in its  African operations.  Resilient Indian Profitability: We expect FY15 EBITDA margin to be stable at  31%-32% (FY14: 32.3%) as the top four Indian telcos increase voice realisation  per minute by reducing discounts and free minutes. The February 2014 spectrum  auctions should hasten industry consolidation, strengthen tariffs and reduce  regulatory risks. In the medium term, we expect the bottom six telcos to exit  the industry as they lack sufficient spectrum and financial resources to remain  viable. During FY14, Bharti's leverage improved mainly due to higher EBITDA  margin at its Indian operations, which increased to 35.7% from 32.5%. African Operations Continue to Struggle: We expect Bharti to continue to  struggle to improve its African EBITDA margin (FY13-14: 26%) as a low usage  elasticity, high cost structure and largely on-net voice traffic favour larger  incumbent operators. Bharti, however, has gained ground and is now the  second-largest operator by subscribers in Nigeria, which accounts for about a  third of its African revenue and EBITDA. Profitability will rise only gradually  as usage grows and the tariff differential between off-net and on-net calls  narrows following a cut in mobile termination rates in some African markets.  Capex Could Surprise: FY15-FY16 capex could be more than Bharti's guidance of  USD2bn-2.2bn (15%-16% of revenue) because fast-growing data services may need  additional investment and African capex could rise as its peers invest more.  During FY14, Bharti invested 20.9% of its revenue, including INR110bn in capex  and INR55bn in spectrum acquisitions. Acquisitive Nature: Bharti's credit profile is exposed to the risk of further  spectrum-led and expansionary acquisitions in India and Africa. The equity  injection of USD1.3bn from Qatar Foundation Endowment in FY14 could only offset  the increased debt on consolidation of Qualcomm's subsidiaries holding 2300MHz  spectrum in four Indian zones and be used for two acquisitions  in Africa.  However, we expect Bharti to follow its stated strategy to repay debt and keep  its leverage below 2.5x. Solid Access to Capital: Bharti will need to refinance a part of its short-term  debt as its cash and equivalents of INR149bn (USD2.5bn) at end-March 2014, fell  short of the INR209bn (USD3.5bn) of debt maturing in the subsequent 12 months.  Its access to capital is adequate as demonstrated in FY14 when it tapped capital  markets four times and raised an aggregate of USD2.3bn. Liquidity could also  benefit from Bharti's plan to monetise its stake in its Indian tower arm, Bharti  Infratel and in its African tower portfolio. Bharti remains exposed to  depreciation in the Indian rupee as it holds over 80% of its debt in non-rupee  currencies. During FY14, its leverage was negatively affected because the rupee  depreciated by more than 10%.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could individually or collectively lead to  negative rating actions include - A higher-than-expected regulatory charge or M&A activity resulting in  FFO-adjusted net leverage remaining above 2.5x on a sustained basis. - A downgrade of India's 'BBB-' Country Ceiling - Negative free cash flows on a sustained basis.
