SEOUL, May 9 (Reuters) - South Korea's finance ministry said on Friday it will take decisive measures against speculative moves that cause one-sidedness in the won <KRW=> market, following recent gains by the won against the dollar.

The Ministry of Finance and Strategy also said it would step up its monitoring of speculative moves in foreign inflows, as well as offshore non-deliverable forwards won trade.
