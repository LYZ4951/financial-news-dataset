ISTANBUL, May 9 (Reuters) - Turkey's Ziraat Bank said on Friday board member Suleyman Aslan, a former chief executive of fellow state-owned lender Halkbank <HALKB.IS> who was detained earlier this year in a corruption probe, has resigned after a month in the role.

Ziraat announced Aslan's April 30 resignation in a filing with the Istanbul stock exchange, but gave no further details.
