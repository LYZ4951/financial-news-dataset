BEIJING, May 9 (Reuters) - The yuan is moving closer to its equilibrium level, China's foreign exchange regulator said on Friday as it forecast more volatility in the country's capital flows.

In its annual report, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange also promised to relax currency controls over the yuan by increasing the yuan's convertibility in the country's capital account.
