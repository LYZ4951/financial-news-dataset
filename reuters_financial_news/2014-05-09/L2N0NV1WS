WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Swiss asset management firm, Swisspartners Group, agreed to pay $4.4 million to the United States to settle a probe over whether it helped U.S. taxpayers evade their federal income taxes, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Friday.

From about 2001 to about 2011, according to a Justice Department statement, Swisspartners helped its U.S. clients open and maintain undeclared foreign bank accounts, which allowed them to avoid paying taxes in full.
