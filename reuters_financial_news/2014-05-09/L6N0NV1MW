OSLO, May 9 (Reuters) - The European Commision is now proposing that Danish mortgage bonds should be classified as extremely liquid assets, meeting a key demand from the country's financial industry, the Danish government said on Friday.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) late last year said Danish covered bonds, a common way to finance houses, should not be classified among the most liquid instruments, posing a threat to Europe's second largest mortgage bond market.
