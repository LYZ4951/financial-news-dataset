WARSAW, May 9 (Reuters) - Poland's largest bank PKO BP <PKO.WA> is expected to show a 2.5-percent rise in first-quarter net profit as the negative impact of record-low rates was offset by higher lending on the back of an economic upturn, a Reuters survey showed.

The state-controlled lender is seen reporting a bottom line of 806 million zlotys ($265.18 million), a poll conducted among nine analysts showed on Friday. "I expect a rather stable result in the first quarter year on year and I wouldn't expect any surprises. We should see increase in credit for companies and households," Michal Sobolewski, an analyst with IDM SA brokerage said. "Better lending will be the result of the already visible revival in the economy. This should positively influence the net income result," he said.
