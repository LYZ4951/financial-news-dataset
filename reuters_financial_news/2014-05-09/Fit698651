May 9 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned CVC Cordatus Loan Fund III  Ltd's notes final ratings, as follows: Class A-1 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class A-2 notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class B-1 notes: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable Class B-2 notes: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable Class C-1 notes: 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable Class C-2 notes: 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable Class D notes: 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable Class E notes: 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable Class F notes: 'B-sf; Outlook Stable Subordinated notes: not rated CVC Cordatus Loan Fund is an arbitrage cash flow CLO. Net proceeds from the  issuance of the notes were used to purchase a EUR436.5m portfolio of mainly  European leveraged loans and bonds.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Average Portfolio Credit Quality Fitch assesses the average credit quality of obligors as being in the 'B'  category; it has credit opinions on all obligors in the indicative portfolio.  The weighted average Fitch rating factor of the indicative portfolio is 33.1.  High Recovery Expectation At least 90% of the portfolio will comprise senior secured obligations. Fitch  views the recovery prospects for these assets as more favourable than for  second-lien, unsecured and mezzanine assets. Fitch has assigned Recovery Ratings  (RR) to all assets in the indicative portfolio. The weighted average recovery  rating of the indicative portfolio is 68.7%.  Exposure to Unhedged Non-Euro-Denominated Assets The transaction is allowed to invest up to 5% of the portfolio in  non-euro-denominated assets. Unhedged non-euro-denominated assets are limited to  a maximum exposure of 2.5% of the portfolio subject to principal haircuts, and  any other non-euro-denominated assets will be hedged with FX forward agreements  from settlement date up to 90 days. The manager can only invest in unhedged or  forward-hedged assets if after the applicable haircuts, the aggregate balance of  the assets is above the reinvestment target par balance. Investment in  non-euro-denominated assets hedged with perfect asset swaps as of the settlement  date is allowed up to 20% of the portfolio.  Partial Interest Rate Hedge Between 5% and 15% of the portfolio can be invested in fixed-rate assets, while  fixed-rate liabilities account for 10% of the target par amount. Therefore, the  transaction is partially hedged against rising interest rates.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A 25% increase in the expected obligor default probability would lead to a  downgrade of one to two notches for the rated notes. A 25% reduction in expected recovery rates would lead to a downgrade of one to  five notches for the rated notes.   TRANSACTION SUMMARY The portfolio is managed by CVC Credit Partners Group Ltd and the sub-manager  CVC Credit Partners Investment Management Ltd. The reinvestment period is  scheduled to end in 2018. The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or note holder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a comment if the  change would not have a negative impact on the then current ratings. Such  amendments may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis  confirms the expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity. If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from the perspective of  the rating Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that the  structure considers the confirmation to be given in the case where Fitch  declines to comment.
