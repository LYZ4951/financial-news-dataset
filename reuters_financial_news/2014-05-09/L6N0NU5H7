STOCKHOLM, May 9 (Reuters) - Moist snuff and cigar maker Swedish Match <SWMA.ST> posted first-quarter operating profit in line with expectations on Friday and said it expected conditions to remain tough this year.

Operating profit fell to 858 million Swedish crowns ($132 million) against 872 million a year ago - excluding major one off items - and compared to a mean forecast of 857 million in a Reuters poll of analysts. The snus and snuff margin was 43.8 percent, lower than the expected 44.3 percent.  DAVID HALLDEN, UBS LIMITED "The report as such was totally in line with expectations... If anything, the margin for Other Tobacco Products was quite strong. The snuff margin was a bit weak and Lights a little soft." "If you look at the outlook, they want to invest for market shares in the U.S., but there is nothing unexpected there. If one was nervous about this report, it is now possible to breath a sigh of relief."  "There is no fundamental reason to trade the share down on this report, I think we will see a rather neutral reaction today."
