LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - European stocks edged lower on Friday as disappointing updates from blue chips such as Spanish telecoms operator Telefonica <TEF.MC> sobered the mood after a market rally on the previous day.

At 0704 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index was down 0.2 percent at 1,356.85 points, with Spain's Ibex <.IBEX> also down 0.2 percent.   Shares in heavyweight Telefonica <TEF.MC> fell 1 percent as the company missed market expectations with a 23 percent fall in net profit. [ID:nS8N0MV00P]  "It looks like Telefonica came in a bit weaker and we had some people going short of the Ibex as a results," Rupert Osborne, futures dealer at IG, said.
