BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - Export-Import Bank of China (EximBank) will lend $1.2 billion to German shipping firms Peter Dohle Shiffahrts-KG and Bernhard Schulte for the purchase of Chinese ships, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The deal will increase chances that German shipping firms will purchase more China-made ships, Xinhua reported the EximBank as saying late on Friday. A prolonged slump in shipping and pressure to shrink bloated loan books have forced many European banks to abandon or scale down lending to the sector.
