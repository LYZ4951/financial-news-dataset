FRANKFURT, March 29 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> plans to cut 2,000 to 2,500 jobs outside Germany at its IT services business T-Systems, in addition to 4,900 cuts planned in Germany, German magazine Focus reported on Saturday, citing supervisory board sources.

T-Systems, which employs almost 53,000 workers around the world, caters for global enterprises such as Siemens <SIEGn.DE>, ThyssenKrupp <TKAG.DE> and Deutsche Post DHL <DPWGn.DE>, and is restructuring to focus resources on meeting surging demand for cloud computing. It said earlier this month that the figure of 4,900 German job cuts, 900 of which have already been completed, was not set in stone but rather the starting point for talks with workers' representatives. More than 29,000 of T-Systems employees are based in Germany. Weekly Focus also said on Saturday that T-Systems planned to sell its unit Individual Desktop Solutions (IDS) to German private equity firm Aurelius <AR4G.DE> as part of its restructuring, adding the sale would affect 620 employees.
