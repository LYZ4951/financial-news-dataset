LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - European stocks consolidated near a 5-1/2 year high on Thursday as indications that the U.S. economy is strengthening and a bullish production update from Rio Tinto <RIO.L> offset some weak trading in the consumer sector.

Basic resources shares <.SXPP> rose 1 percent as Rio Tinto, the world's no. 2 iron ore miner, recorded big increases in production, betting China's economic growth will provide a ready market for decades to come. [ID:nL3N0KP50U] Also supporting sentiment, the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book published late on Wednesday the U.S. economy continued to grow at a moderate pace from late November through the end of 2013, with some regions of the country expecting a pick-up in growth. [ID:nW1N0IP02M] Corporate figures in the European consumer sector, however, were less upbeat after both Dutch grocer Ahold <AHLN.AS> and luxury group Richemont <CFR.VX> reported lower than expected quarterly sales, sending the shares down 2.6 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. [ID:nL6N0KN2C5] [ID:nWEB00GQV] The broader FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of pan-European shares was flat 1,339.84 at 0808 GMT, after hitting a 5-1/2 year high in the previous session.
