Jan 16 (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC <APO.N> will buy CEC Entertainment Inc <CEC.N>, the parent of Chuck E Cheese restaurant chain,   for about $1 billion, the Financial Times reported.

The fund controlled by billionaire Leon Black will pay $54 per share for CEC, the newspaper reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. (http://link.reuters.com/vuw95v) The deal, which will be announced on Thursday morning, is an 11.5 percent premium to CEC's Wednesday close of $48.43. Last week, Reuters exclusively reported that CEC was working with Goldman Sachs Inc <GS.N> and was speaking with interested buyers over the last several months. [ID:nL2N0KH239] Apollo is among a number of private equity firms to have expressed interest in the group, the Financial Times said, and is using Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> to lead the financing for its bid. CEC and its franchises operate 567 entertainment-focused Chuck E Cheese stores in 47 states, the majority of which are owned and operated by the company. The company's Chuck E Cheese stores have musical and robotic entertainment, games, rides, play areas and food like pizza and sandwiches.
