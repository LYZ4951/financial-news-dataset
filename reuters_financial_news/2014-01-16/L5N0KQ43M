JERUSALEM, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Israeli central bank governor Karnit Flug on Thursday nominated Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg for the post of deputy governor, subject to government approval, the Bank of Israel said in a statement.

As deputy governor, Baudot-Trajtenberg would serve as a member of the bank's six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) - which sets interest rates - and its Supervisory Council. If the appointment is confirmed by a vetting committee and cabinet, the Bank of Israel's two top officials will be women. Since 2010 Baudot-Trajtenberg has been deputy dean at the IDC Herzliya's School of Economics. Most of her professional experience was at Bank Hapoalim <POLI.TA>, which she joined in 1987. Flug succeeded the popular Stanley Fischer, who stepped down at the end of June 2013, two years before the scheduled end of his second five-year term. She had been Fischer's deputy for two years before assuming the role of acting governor until she was approved as governor in October. Fischer has been nominated vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Since July, Israel's MPC has been operating with five members.
