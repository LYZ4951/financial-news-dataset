SINGAPORE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Singapore property and hotel developer City Developments Ltd <CTDM.SI> on Thursday named an investment industry veteran as its first chief executive, as part of a strategy to diversify its business over concerns of a sluggish home market.

Grant Kelly, 49, oversaw real estate funds in the Asia- Pacific for private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC <APO.N> before his move to CityDev. He has worked for real investment firms including Holdfast Capital Limited and Colony Capital Asia since early 2002.  CityDev said it hoped to take advantage of Kelly's experience in finance and international real estate investment to explore new territories. It also appointed managing director Kwek Leng Joo as deputy chairman, the company said in a statement. The position of managing director will be abolished, CityDev said. The new appointments take effect on Feb. 17. "We need to be less Singapore-centric in light of limited opportunities domestically," said Executive Chairman Kwek Leng Beng. "These appointments will help strengthen and deepen the expertise of our management team as we shift gears and look outwards to capitalise on growth markets."
