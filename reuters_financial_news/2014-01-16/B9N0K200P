BEIJING, Jan 16 (Reuters) - China central bank said on Thursday that it would tell banks to cut lending to poorly managed local government financing firms while supporting those that have sound management and risk controls.

"We will work together with related departments and local governments to thoroughly clear up local government financing vehicles with poor credibility, unclear functions and an unsustainable financial situation," the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website, www.pbc.gov.cn.
