LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Thursday that it would hold the first of a new type of repo operation to provide liquidity to Britain's banking system on Feb. 11.

The new Indexed Long-Term Repo will offer more liquidity at cheaper rates, longer maturities and against a wider range of collateral than previously available, the BoE said.
