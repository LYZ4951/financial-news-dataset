LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - British credit information provider Experian <EXPN.L> said on Thursday that Chief Executive Don Robert would replace John Peace as chairman and Finance Director Brian Cassin would replace him as chief executive.

Peace, who is also chairman of Standard Chartered <STAN.L>, said last May that he would step down as chairman by the time of the company's annual meeting in July 16. The board changes will take effect at the end of that meeting.
