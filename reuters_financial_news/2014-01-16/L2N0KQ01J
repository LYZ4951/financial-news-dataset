Jan 15 (Reuters) - Marvell Technology Group Ltd <MRVL.O> on Wednesday said it is not in talks with KKR & Co <KKR.N> on a major transaction such as a buyout, a little over two weeks after the private equity firm reported a 6.8 percent stake.

The chipmaker made the disclosure in a filing with the U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, where it is defending against a lawsuit by Carnegie Mellon University alleging patent infringement in connection with computer disk drives. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer rejected Marvell's bid to cut $620 million from a $1.17 billion jury verdict against the company. [ID:nL2N0KP0UW] Marvell, in its filing, rejected what it called Carnegie Mellon's concern that the KKR investment might herald "extraordinary corporate transactions" that could threaten the university's ability to collect a final judgment. "In fact, Marvell has no present plans for an extraordinary corporate transaction (e.g., buyout, merger, reorganization or liquidation) and has not been in negotiations with KKR concerning such a transaction," it said. "If anything," it added, "KKR's recent vote of confidence, expressed by increasing its investment in Marvell, only provides further testament to Marvell's financial strength." Marvell said it is in talks to obtain a bond it will need to post while it appeals a final judgment once it is entered. When KKR disclosed its increased stake in Marvell on Dec. 30, it said it "may engage" in talks with the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company on big transactions. {ID:nL3N0K92IJ] Marvell shares rose 4.5 percent the next day to $14.38. They have since risen another 7.9 percent, despite closing down 29 cents at $15.52 on Wednesday.
