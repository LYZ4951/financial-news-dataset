BANGKOK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thai stocks rose on Thursday as bargain hunting emerged in shares of large cap firms and domestic political tension boosted expectations of an interest rate cut while Indonesian shares pulled lower after two sessions of gains.

The key SET index <.SETI> was up 1.4 percent at 1,294.45 at midday as index heavyweights such as PTT <PTT.BK>, PTT Exploration and Production <PTTE.BK> and Advanced Info Service <ADVA.BK> recovered from the previous session's losses. Low valuations in shares of blue chip firms attracted domestic funds, including so-called trigger funds which will redeem when the index hits a target level, brokers said. "Any market weakness may be tempered by buying orders from more trigger funds. Market now looks at a possible rate cut by the central bank next week which could help on stock inflows," said Phillip Securities strategist Teerada Charnyingyong. Domestic institutions were net buyers of Thai shares over the past two sessions when foreign investors were net sellers.
