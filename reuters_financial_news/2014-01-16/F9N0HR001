FRANKFURT, Jan 16 (Reuters) - It would be difficult for the European Central Bank to conduct lending operations so that the money is available for specific purposes, ECB Governing Council member Ardo Hansson was quoted as saying on Thursday.

ECB President Mario Draghi said earlier this month that the central bank wanted to ensure that if it were to conduct more long-term liquidity operations, the proceeds would not be used  just for purchasing government bonds. Asked about the possibility of targeting lending for certain purposes, Hansson said he was "sceptical" of such a move. "Especially in the euro zone where things are being implemented on a decentralised level, I see this as complicated," he said, adding it would mean "too much micro management."
