WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Florida and other U.S. states are reviewing food distributor Sysco Corp's <SYY.N> proposed deal to buy rival US Foods Inc [USFOO.UL], the state attorney general's office said on Thursday.

Sysco said in December that it would buy US Foods Inc for about $3.5 billion from its private equity owners in a deal that would combine the two largest U.S. food distributors and create a company commanding at least a quarter of the $235 billion North American market.
