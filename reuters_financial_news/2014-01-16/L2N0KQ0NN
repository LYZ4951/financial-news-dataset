BRASILIA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Mexico's ambitious reform agenda will start to pay off after a very disappointing 2013, but the recovery will not likely be as strong as previously hoped as Latin America braces for another bumpy year for local markets, a Reuters poll found.

Economists in a Reuters poll of over 80 banks and research firms have trimmed their 2014 growth forecasts for most of the region's major economies since October.  There were several reasons offered, such as smaller capital flows, lackluster commodity prices and rising inflation in some countries unlike in many other parts of the world. Mexico's recovery prospects still stand out, despite a small cut in market forecasts, as it pushed through a string of market-friendly reforms and looks set to benefit the most in the region from a stronger U.S. economy. But down south, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela will probably struggle to keep up their already modest growth rates as rising prices hurt consumer confidence, spook investors and leave scant room for any economic stimulus.  "Brazil will struggle a bit and Argentina will suffer quite a lot, but Mexico has a bright outlook for a number of reasons: the U.S. recovery, a more supportive fiscal policy and a balanced credit sheet," said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, in London. Mexico's economy is expected to grow 3.4 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 1.3 percent last year. Mexico changed its constitution in December to end a 75-year oil and gas monopoly, in what Santander economists said promises a "tectonic" change in competitiveness for years ahead. "The benefits of the reform are mostly long term in nature," David Franco and Rafael Camarena wrote in a note. "Financial markets will likely remain volatile due to external conditions, (but) the advance in the implementation of the structural reform agenda, in particular the energy reform, will maintain the interest of investors." Colombia is another exception to the challenging regional outlook, with expected growth of 4.5 percent in 2014 - up from an estimated 4.1 percent in 2013. Fears of a rapid removal of monetary stimulus in the United States have subsided since December, when the Federal Reserve announced a very gradual tapering of its monthly asset purchases. However, economists still see a trend of diminishing flows to emerging countries, which makes the investments headed to Mexico's energy sector even more important. Capital Economics' Shearing also mentioned Mexico's recent rate cuts as another factor boosting economic growth.  Mexico managed to lower its benchmark lending rate <MXCBIR=ECI> to a record low of 3.5 percent only because inflation remains relatively tame at around 4 percent <MXCPIA=ECI>, which is not the case in some of its southern neighbours. "As far as inflation is concerned, the Latin American economies can be split into three groups: the good, the bad and the ugly," said Marcelo Carvalho, head of Latin America economic research at BNP Paribas.  Carvalho singled out Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru for keeping inflation in line with their relatively "ambitious" targets. Argentina and Venezuela, he says, have the ugliest outlook for inflation.
