MUMBAI, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Thursday after earlier marking their highest levels in five weeks as mobile carriers such as Idea Cellular slumped on possible high bidding prices at a spectrum auction next month after eight companies applied to bid.

Idea Cellular Ltd <IDEA.NS> slumped 7.5 percent, marking its biggest single-day percentage fall since May 2010, while Bharti Airtel Ltd <BRTI.NS> provisionally fell 5 percent, the most since September 2013.
