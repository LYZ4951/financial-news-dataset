SYDNEY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Malaysia-based International Islamic Liquidity Management Corp (IILM) will expand its Islamic bond programme by $370 million to $860 million next week, increasing its issuance of short-term sukuk for the first time since its launch last year.

The IILM, a consortium of central banks from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, will conduct the auction of three-month sukuk on Jan. 20, according to a filing with Malaysia's central bank. IILM sukuk are designed to meet a shortage of highly liquid, investment-grade financial instruments which Islamic banks can trade to manage their short-term funding needs. The IILM sold $490 million worth of three-month paper in separate auctions in August and November, while its plans call for increasing issuance of sukuk to as much as $2 billion. In November, the IILM also expanded the number of primary dealers handling its Islamic bond programme to nine from seven, adding Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD> and CIMB Bank Bhd <CIMB.KL>.
