MEXICO CITY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Mexican low-cost airline VivaAerobus filed a prospectus on Thursday to list shares on Mexico's stock exchange for the first time.

The Monterrey-based group launched in 2006 and is a venture of Mexican transport company Grupo IAMSA and the family behind the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair <RYA.I>. Vivaaerobus gave no details on when it hoped to offer the shares nor how many it would sell. The airline in October said it had ordered 52 Airbus A320-family jets worth $5.1 billion. [ID:nL1N0IB0VH]
