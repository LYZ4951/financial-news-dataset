OSLO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Norway's banks saw lower than expected credit demand from households in the fourth quarter of 2013, and expect further easing of demand in the first quarter of 2014, the central bank said in a quarterly lending survey on Thursday.

Corporate credit demand was expected to stay unchanged for the first quarter. [ID:nO9N0BW01B]  Analysts gave the following comments:  KARI-DUE ANDRESEN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, HANDELSBANKEN "The survey is about as expected but banks say they have eased their fourth quarter credit practise for households a little bit." "We had thought the weaker development in the housing market would make banks more cautious." "Banks say they may also maintain their less restrictive policies in the first quarter." "It's clear that the weaker (property market) development influences demand for loans." "From the banks' side it looks like their intention is to ease their practise to maintain market shares."
