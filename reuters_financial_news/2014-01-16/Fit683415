Jan 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings is maintaining Northern Ireland Electricity Limited's [VRDNI.UL] (NIE) 'A-' senior unsecured rating on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). NIE Finance plc's GBP400m notes due 2026 - also rated 'A-' - also remain on RWN. The agency has affirmed NIE's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR is Stable.  The affirmation of the Long-term IDR and the Stable Outlook reflect NIE's ties  to its ultimate parent Electricity Supply Board [ELECS.UL] (ESB; BBB+/Stable; senior  unsecured BBB+), including full ownership, liquidity support by ESB and a  back-to-back interest rate swap arrangements entered into by the two companies  in April 2011.  The RWN continues to reflect the pending 'Transmission and Distribution Price  Controls 2013-2017' (RP5) for NIE which could lead to a weaker standalone credit  profile for the company (currently assessed at 'BBB+') and hence a downgrade of  its senior unsecured rating, which is notched up by one level from the  standalone credit profile. A weaker standalone credit profile would therefore  result in the senior unsecured rating of NIE being equal to that of ESB, even  though NIE's IDR may remain unchanged at 'BBB+' due to the parent's support. Fitch initially placed NIE on RWN on 17 May 2012 and has subsequently maintained  the RWN on 16 November 2012, 31 January 2013, 30 April 2013, 16 July 2013 and 16  October 2013. This rating review is to comply with Fitch's internal guideline to  review ratings on Rating Watch every three months following the initial  six-month review.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland (UReg) on 30 April 2013 referred NIE's  final determination (FD) to the Competition Commission (CC). The CC published  NIE's provisional determination on 12 November 2013. We would likely downgrade  NIE's senior unsecured rating to 'BBB+' from 'A-' if the proposal included in  the provisional determination materialises in the CC's final determination as  indicated in our comment published on 27 November 2013 'Competition Commission's  Provisional Determination Negative for Northern Ireland Electricity' which is  available on www.fitchratings.com. The CC proposes significant changes to NIE's price control, including separate  price controls for the company's transmission and distribution networks, a 50:50  cost risk-sharing mechanism for capital and operational expenditure (capex and  opex), allowances for direct capital expenditure costs based on a review of  NIE's proposal and a benchmarking of indirect costs using GB distribution  network operators as comparators. The CC also proposes a price control period of  5.5 years from 1 April 2012 to 30 September 2017 for which revenue allowances  would be set. CC also proposes arrangements to return to either consumers or NIE  any differences in the CC's proposed revenue allowances for the period from 1  April 2012 to October 2014 and the tariffs that have already been set for that  period.  Although the CC is proposing additional capex allowances, the proposed  significantly lower cost of capital of 4.1% compared with the 4.6% proposed by  UReg in the FD, together with the lack of any incentive revenue available to  NIE, is expected to have a negative impact on the company's allowed revenues and  consequently on its cash flow generation ability. We expect the reduction in  cash flow generation, mainly driven by the lower regulatory allowed revenues, to  negatively affect NIE's post-maintenance and post-tax interest cover ratio as  calculated by Fitch and limit the company's financial flexibility. The CC is expected to send the final determination to UReg by February 2014,  although the maximum statutory deadline has been extended until April 2014. We  will review the ratings once the CC's final determination is published.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - A downgrade of ESB - A negative rating action on NIE's senior unsecured rating would be considered  if post maintenance interest cover ratio (PMICR) falls below 1.4x and/or  leverage (net adjusted debt/regulatory asset base) rises above 57.5%, both on a  sustained basis.   Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: - A positive rating action on ESB - An affirmation on NIE's senior unsecured rating would be considered if the  decision by the CC on the FD, together with NIE's new business plan for RP5,  leads to comfortably stronger credit metrics than those indicated in the  negative rating triggers.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE As at 30 September 2013, NIE had GBP49.1m in cash and cash equivalents and  undrawn committed revolving credit facilities of GBP60m maturing in 2015, which  are provided by ESB. This is sufficient to cover short-term funding needs.
