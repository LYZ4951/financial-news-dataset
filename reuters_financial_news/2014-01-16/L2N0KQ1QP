MEXICO CITY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Mexico's national oil company Pemex is looking at issuing bonds in euros following Wednesday's placement of $4 billion in debt in international markets, the company's treasurer said in an interview.

"We are also looking very closely at the evolution of the euro bond market," said Pemex Treasurer Rodolfo Campos, noting the company's 1.3 billion euro ($1.8 billion) issue in November. A Pemex deal in euros would follow a $5 billion-equivalent euro and sterling offering from Brazil's Petrobras [PETRDP.UL] early this year that marked the largest such trade ever from an emerging market issuer, underscoring demand for higher yielding debt in euros. [ID:nL6N0KK2QF] Pemex [PEMX.UL] plans to borrow $14.7 billion this year, with up to $6 billion destined for international debt markets. Campos said it is "very unlikely" that Pemex will seek to place further dollar debt this year, which leaves open the possibility that its remaining debt will be issued in euros. The company's borrowing is used to refinance debt and fund capital expenditures, he said. Campos said Wednesday's record demand for its sale of $4 billion in bonds, including $3 billion in a 30-year bond, is in large part attributable to last month's sweeping energy reform which has boosted investor demand for Pemex debt. The reform ended Pemex's 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly and is expected to attract significant new streams of foreign investment to help develop Mexico's untapped reserves. "It reflects the fact that the appetite for (debt) from Mexico, from Pemex has returned as result of the structural reforms," said Campos. He said the demand for the $4 billion bond sale was the most ever for a Mexican issuance. Campos also said it is "highly probable" that Mexico's government will achieve a pension reform this year that will migrate the company's retirees from a defined benefit plan to individualized defined contribution plans. Pemex employs about 150,000 workers and funds the retirement of 70,000 former employees.
