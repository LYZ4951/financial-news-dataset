Jan 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Qatar's imminent sukuk issuance of roughly USD3bn will kick-start what may be a record year for the sharia-compliant debt market, Fitch Ratings says. Regional growth and robust government spending are likely to be partially funded through sukuk programmes in established Gulf  Cooperation Council sukuk markets. At the same time, strong investor demand is  likely to attract debut issues from Islamic and non-Islamic states in 2014. The push by sovereigns in the region to be become an Islamic finance hub is also  likely to spur sukuk issuance. We estimate that issuance dropped around 12% to USD120bn in 2013 due in part to  market jitters over US bond purchase tapering. However, demand remains strong  and we expect this decline to be a blip in the longer-term trend of steady  growth, with 2014 issuance likely to be at least in line with 2012's record of  USD137bn. Several first-time issuers are likely to enter the market in 2014 including the  UK, which plans to debut a GBP200m sukuk this year. Luxembourg and Hong Kong  have also recently taken steps to introduce new legislation that would allow the  issuance of sukuk. Sovereign and sovereign-linked issuers will remain the  dominant source of supply, but 2014 could also see more issues from corporates  and non-sovereign entities, such as ATLANTICLUX Lebensversicherung's USD100m  insurance-linked sukuk that Fitch rated 'BBB-' in October. Although all these issues would be relatively small, they will be a significant  step in broadening the range of debt available to investors. Sub-Saharan African  sovereigns have also been considering issuance for some time. As well as the strong demand from investors who will only buy sharia-compliant  securities, issuers are likely to be attracted by evidence of increasing market  efficiency. Structuring costs have fallen significantly and the time taken to  put together a deal has fallen from as much as six months to a few weeks. Supply  and demand imbalances have sometimes led to pricing for sukuk being lower than  for bonds, but we believe any difference is likely to disappear in the medium  term as these imbalances lessen. There are still challenges that will limit the attraction of sukuk to many  investors and the development of a liquid secondary market. In particular these  include the lack of a standardised deal structure and the lack of legal  precedent over investors' ability to enforce their rights in many jurisdictions. Despite demand for the product, growth of sukuk is still directly linked to  global issuance sentiment and issuance growth in general.
