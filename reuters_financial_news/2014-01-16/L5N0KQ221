Tunis, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Morocco's trade deficit narrowed by 2.8 percent last year compared with 2012 as the economic slowdown reduced demand for imports, the foreign exchange regulator said on Thursday.

The 2013 deficit came to 196.38 billion Moroccan dirhams ($23.80 billion). Imports fell 2 percent from a year earlier, with energy imports down 4 percent and wheat imports dropping by 31.7 percent as the national harvest hit record levels. Tourism receipts slipped slightly to 57.55 billion dirhams from 57.83 billion dirhams, while remittances from the 4.5 million Moroccans living abroad decreased by 0.7 percent to 58.36 billion dirhams.
