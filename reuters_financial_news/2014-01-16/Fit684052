Jan 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based PT Mitra Pinasthika Mustika Finance's (MPM Finance) National Long-Term Rating at 'A-(idn)'. The Outlook is Stable. The rating reflects Fitch's expectation that MPM Finance will receive support  from its parent, PT Mitra Pinasthika Mustika Tbk <MPMX.JK> (MPM; A(idn)/Stable), in times  of need.  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that MPM will continue to  support MPM Finance in case of need.  'A' National Ratings denote expectations of low default risk relative to other  issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in circumstances or  economic conditions may affect the capacity for timely repayment to a greater  degree than is the case for financial commitments denoted by a higher rated  category.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's view of a high propensity of timely support from MPM is underpinned by  MPM Finance's strategic importance to the former's automotive business. This is  underlined in MPM's 100% ownership of MPM Finance. MPM Finance has an important  role in MPM's automotive business as it provides car financing services.  MPM Finance's asset quality weakened with non-performing loans (NPLs) increasing  to 2.6% of total net manage receivables at end-September 2013 (end-2012: 1.7%).  This is mainly due to the weaker finances of borrowers from the commodity  sector. MPM Finance's management has implemented measures to improve its asset  quality, including setting up a special team to focus on recovering existing  NPLs and strengthening its collection processes. In the near to medium term, Fitch expects profitability to be under pressure as  credit impairment is likely to increase in the near to medium term due to the  prolonged slowdown in the commodity sector. .
