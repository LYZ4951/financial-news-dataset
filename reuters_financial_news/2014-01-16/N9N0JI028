NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder confidence faded a bit at the start of 2014, although most developers expected the housing recovery to continue, data from the National Association of Home Builders released on Thursday showed.

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dipped to 56  points in January from a downwardly revised 57 in December. The December reading originally reported at 58 was the highest level since August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a January reading of 58, with a reading of 50 or higher indicating more builders view conditions as good than poor. "Following an unexpected jump last month, builder confidence has essentially leveled out and is holding at a solid level," NAHB Chairman Rick Judson said in a statement. "Many markets continue to improve and this bodes well for future home sales." The home builder confidence index, which is seen as a proxy on housing construction, has been above 50 for eight straight months. The Commerce Department will release its December housing starts data at 8:30 a.m. (1530 GMT) on Friday.  Economists polled by Reuters forecast developers broke ground for single-family homes and apartment buildings at an annualized rate of 990,000 units last month. This followed a November pace of 1.091 million units which was the strongest level since February 2008. [ID:nLLAQME9GY] All three NAHB survey components fell in January from their December levels.  The measure on home builders' view on current sales conditions fell to 62 from a downwardly revised 63. The initially reported December reading of 64 was the highest level since December 2005. The index on expectations on future sales fell 2 points to 60, while the gauge on traffic of prospective buyers declined to 40 from downwardly revised 43.
