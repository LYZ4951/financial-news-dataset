Jan 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is unlikely ever to conduct outright quantitative easing like its rich-world counterparts, even with low inflation and a rickety economic recovery, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.

But with a depleted ammunition box, after having slashed its main interest rate to near zero and given more than 1 trillion euros of cheap cash to banks for a three-year period, its options to shore up the economy are limited. Economists in the poll conducted Jan. 10-15 placed a one-in-five chance of such an event especially with Germany, the strongest member of the club, opposing a change in the ECB's charter empowering it to make such purchases. "Quantitative easing will prove to be too controversial a policy within the Governing Council to get adopted," said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan all have conducted quantitative easing (QE), purchasing government bonds which in turn floods the banking system with cash. "The ECB will eventually take further stimulative action - most likely in the form of a LTRO (long-term refinancing operation) which may very well be tailored specifically towards bank lending to businesses." How effective another LTRO would be, however, is unclear. Banks have already paid back around half of that ECB cash, pushing money market rates higher and hurting credit growth. Even when banks held cash, they preferred to park most of it with the central bank instead of lending to businesses and consumers - contrary to what the ECB had hoped for. "During last year when the Federal Reserve and Bank of England expanded their balance sheets, it actually shrunk for the ECB," said Altaz Dagha, economist at Westpac, referring to banks paying back the emergency loans. Still, the euro zone has pulled back from the edge of the cliff in the last two years when the chances of Greece defaulting on its debt and exiting the monetary union were high. Ireland has also paid back the entire bailout loan it took from the International Monetary Fund and even managed to sell its bonds in the market. The Reuters survey showed economists predict the euro zone economy to grow 1.0 percent in 2014, unchanged from last month's predictions and lower than growth expectations in the United States and UK, followed by 1.4 percent next year. The poll also showed Germany is seen leading economic growth in 2014 on the back of higher household spending and investment, while France and Italy will likely lag.

[ID:nF9N0D3008] The slight improvement in economic activity though has not helped many people find jobs. In Spain, the euro zone's fourth  largest economy, one in every four citizens is out of work. Economists forecast the unemployment rate to stay at current levels through this year and dip only a little to 11.8 percent in 2015. Compounding the ECB's woes is the persistently low inflation rate in the euro zone. At a 0.8 percent annual rate in December it is next only to Japan among the group of four industrialised nations. ECB President Mario Draghi said the bloc may experience a "prolonged period of low inflation" - steering clear of highlighting any risk of a deflation. A majority of economists, thirty-seven of 44, agreed with that assessment. "The risk of persistent deflation depends on the behaviour of households," said Azad Zangana, economist at Schroders. "If we start to see households lowering their inflation expectations to reflect falling prices, and then begin to postpone their purchases, then there is a risk that the fall in demand will push prices lower". Inflation is seen averaging just 1.1 percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2015, well below the ECB's 2 percent ceiling.
