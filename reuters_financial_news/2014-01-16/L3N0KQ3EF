COLOMBO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks rose for a sixth straight session to a near five-month high on Thursday, led by market heavyweight John Keells Holdings PLC <JKH.CM>, as falling interest rates helped retail investor sentiment and foreign investors bought risky assets on a net basis.

The main stock index <.CSE> gained 0.83 percent, or 50.59 points, to end at 6,166.98, its highest close since Aug. 19. It has gained 3.73 percent in the last six sessions and is in an overbought market. Shares in conglomerate John Keells Holdings rose 3.98 percent to 240.20 rupees. Analysts said the central bank's interest rate cut on Jan. 2 and the recent fall in T-bill yields had boosted sentiment and helped sustain gains.
