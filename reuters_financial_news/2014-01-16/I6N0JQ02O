MILAN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Unipol <UNPI.MI> rose up to 2.68 percent in early trade on Thursday after Europe's biggest insurer Allianz <ALVG.DE> offered to buy some assets the Italian group must sell to comply with antitrust regulations.

The Italian antitrust authority has imposed the sale of a portfolio of assets with premiums worth around 1.7 billion euros ($2.31 billion) on the Italian insuer after it agreed to buy rival Fondiaria-SAI in 2012.
