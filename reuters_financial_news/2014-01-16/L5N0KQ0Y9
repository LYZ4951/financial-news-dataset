JERUSALEM, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Israel said it plans a euro-denominated bond offering on international markets with the size and timing dependent on market conditions, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday.

Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have been hired as underwriters. In the coming days, ministry officials will begin meetings with foreign investors in Europe to get a sense of demand, which has been very high in recent offerings.
