SEOUL, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Seoul shares inched up to a one-week closing high on Thursday after fresh U.S. data suggested a firm growth outlook there, while big bets were put off until a Korean corporate-results season kicks off next week.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.2 percent at 1,957.32 points, its highest close since Jan. 8. Institutional investors reversed their initial position to become net buyers of 45.6 billion won ($42.9 million) of KOSPI shares, while offshore investors bought a net 5.2 billion won to snap a four session net-selling streak.
