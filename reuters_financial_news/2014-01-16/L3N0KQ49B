LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A new app that its creators say allows players to simulate a major merger or acquisition deal, complete with all the drama and backstabbing but with none of the actual financial downside, became available on Thursday for iPhones and iPads.

"M&A Game" is said by its developer, the international data firm ansarada, to be the world's first mergers-and-acquisitions (M&A) game app. It aims to create all the thrills and cutthroat competition of a real takeover bid. "M&A is usually a long and intensive process involving months of detailed work by everyone working on deals," Sam Riley, CEO of ansarada, said in a news release. "We decided to design and build a game to provide some escapist fun for the whole M&A community, anywhere in the world."  Players can buy, sell and merge corporations across nine major industrial sectors with a team of investment bankers, accountants and lawyers. Deal-making tactics range all the way from flattery to haggling and bullying. "We created it to be a fun escape, but also very competitive because people involved in M&A are pretty competitive by their nature," a spokesperson for ansarada said. Players are asked to select from a range of qualities and attributes they think make a good M&A deal maker, including drive, charisma, strength, and even deception. The catch? You can't have all the qualities, so a savvy CEO will know which to prioritise. Does the app herald a rebound for the largely dormant M&A sector? European M&A was down nearly a quarter on last year to $511 billion but, with firms sitting on piles of excess cash, investors are now pushing them to snap up rivals. [ID:nL6N0JZ3RA]
