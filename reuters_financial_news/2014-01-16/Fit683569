Jan 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Old Mutual Life Assurance  Company (South Africa) Limited's [OMLAR.UL] (OMLACSA) National Long-term rating to  'AAA(zaf)' and its subordinated debt to 'AA(zaf)' and affirmed its National  Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'AAA(zaf)'. The agency has also  affirmed Skandia Life Assurance Company Ltd's (Skandia) IFS rating at 'A-' and  Old Mutual PLC's <OML.L> (Old Mutual) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'.  The Outlooks on the group's IDRs and IFS ratings are Stable. A full list of  rating actions is at the end of this comment.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of OMLACSA's National Long-term National Ratings solely reflects a  recalibration of the higher end of the South African national scale rather than  any change in Fitch's assessment of fundamental issuer-specific credit  considerations.  Old Mutual's main South African operation, OMLACSA, and its main non-South  African operation, Skandia, are "Core" to the group under Fitch's insurance  group rating methodology and are therefore rated based on the credit quality of  the group as a whole. Old Mutual's ratings are constrained by South Africa's Long-term local currency  IDR (BBB+/Stable) and Long-term foreign currency IDR (BBB/Stable), reflecting  the importance of the group's South African business for its balance sheet and  earnings. Old Mutual derives about 75% of its operating earnings from South  Africa.  However, the group's IFS rating is one notch higher than the South African local  currency IDR in recognition of Old Mutual's geographical diversification, with  about one-quarter of earnings generated in the UK and Europe. The additional  notch also reflects the group's ability to share with policyholders potential  investment losses on its investments in the South African financial markets, and  the financial flexibility from being listed on the London Stock Exchange.  RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade or downgrade of South Africa's Long-term foreign or local currency  IDR could trigger a corresponding rating action on Old Mutual. Old Mutual could be downgraded if there is greater-than-expected earnings  pressure on its South African operations from volatile investment markets, weak  consumer confidence and recessionary fears. A reduction in the geographical  diversification of earnings or a deterioration in the quality of non-South  African earnings, with hard-currency cover falling below 2x, could also lead to  a downgrade.  The rating actions are as follows:   Old Mutual PLC Long-term IDR: affirmed at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable  Senior unsecured debt: affirmed at 'BBB-' Subordinated debt: affirmed at 'BB' Short-term IDR and commercial paper: affirmed at 'F3'   Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited National IFS rating: affirmed at 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Long-term rating: upgraded to 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable Subordinated debt: upgraded to 'AA(zaf)'   Skandia Life Assurance Company Ltd IFS rating: affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook Stable
