Jan 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hong Kong-based  Hopewell Holdings Limited's <0054.HK> (HHL) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default  Ratings (IDR) at 'BBB-'.  The Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Asset Portfolio: HHL's IDR is underpinned by its stable cash flows from  toll roads and its investment property portfolio. The Stable Outlook reflects  our view that HHL's credit profile will remain acceptable for its current rating  despite the expected increase in financial leverage in the next few years due to  spending to develop the Hopewell Centre II property project. Strong Toll-Road Business: The toll-road business, which is managed via Hopewell  Highway Infrastructure Limited (HHI, 68% owned by HHL), has continued its  relatively stable performance despite the launch of toll waivers during public  holidays and tariff cuts in 2012.  An overall increase in traffic volume is  driven by continued economic growth in Guangdong province, and improving  connections to local road networks and strategic locations. The opening of Phase  III West of the Western Delta Route in January 2013 drove an increase in revenue  in Phase II West (27% increase in the financial year ended June 2013) and  resulted in new revenue from Phase III West (daily toll revenue of CNY455,000 in  December 2013). Solid Rental Income: Fitch expects the property investment business to continue  to post a solid performance following a strong showing FY13. Rental revenue  increased 13% to HKD0.8bn in FY13. HHL has a few property investment projects in  the pipeline, such as the Lee Tung Street project and Hopewell Centre II, which  are expected to generate synergies for existing property assets and provide more  cash flow upside for HHL in the next three to five years. Limited Operating Scale: The issuer's IDR is constrained by its limited scale.  Both the toll-road and property investment portfolios are relatively small.  Its  existing investment property assets are less 'prime' than those of its Hong Kong  peers rated in the 'BBB' and 'A' category in terms of locations and/or scale. Increasing Leverage: HHL's leverage is likely to increase within the next two  years and come close to Fitch's threshold when it would consider negative rating  action .  However, Fitch expects leverage to return to a level consistent with  its current rating once the sales proceeds from the residential portion of the  Lee Tung Street project remit back to HHL.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may individually or collectively lead to  negative rating action include - Aggressive change in business mix and strategy - Hopewell's on balance sheet net debt to on balance sheet EBITDA (excluding  contributions from property development) exceeding 6.0x (End-FY13: 3.0x) - A fund from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage (with proportionate project  debt at toll road JV and excluding contribution from property development)  exceeding 7.0x.  (End-FY13: 5.5x)
