STOCKHOLM, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Apartment prices fell 2 percent in Sweden in December while single-family house prices were unchanged, figures from an association of Swedish real estate agents showed on Thursday.

Compared to December last year, the apartment prices have risen 11 percent while single-family house prices are 5 percent higher, Svensk Maklarstatistik said. Swedish house prices have nearly tripled over the last 15 years and both the centre-righ government and financial regulators are worried about high levels of household debt.  The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) has introduced tougher rules for lenders and borrowers, but the government has said more measures may be needed to cool the housing market.
