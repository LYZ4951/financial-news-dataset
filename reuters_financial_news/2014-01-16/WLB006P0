LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Aberdeen Asset Management <ADN.L> said clients withdrew a net 4.4 billion pounds ($7.19 billion)in the last three months of 2013 as sentiment turned against emerging market investments.

A total of 6.8 billion pounds entered its funds while 11.2 billion left, it said in a trading statement on Thursday, adding that it expected its new business pipeline to deliver an additional 2 billion pounds in assets in early 2014. However, it expects to see further volatility in both markets and investor sentiment "in the coming months", the company said.
