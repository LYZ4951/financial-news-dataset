BANGKOK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thai shares hit a three-week high on Thursday on heavy buying in large-caps and banks amid expectations of lower interest rates, despite continuing political uncertainty, while the Philippines rose to a one-week high aided by foreign buying.

The key SET index <.SETI> ended up 1.9 percent at 1,301.48, the highest since Dec. 26, with Advanced Info Service <ADVA.BK> and Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> among the top gainers. Trading volume was relatively high, with technical-led buying heavy around the 1,300 level, said Teerawut Kanniphakul, strategist at broker CIMB Securities (Thailand). Domestic institutions bought shares for a third consecutive session on Thursday, Thomson Reuters data showed <TH/TRADING02>. A number of so-called trigger funds, which redeem when the index hits a target level, have piled into low-valuation shares, said Phillip Securities. However, caution remained as protests in Bangkok escalated, trying to force out the government and calling for a reform before an election. The caretaker government has confirmed a general election will be held on Feb. 2. [ID:nL3N0KQ1Z7] Citi Research said the unpredictable politics could increase the chances of a rate cut by the Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) next week. "Even if the rate cut event doesn't happen next week, pushing back elections as Bangkok is still under siege, may revive the likelihood of more rate stimulus," Citi said in a report dated Jan. 15. Among the bright spots, the Philippine index <.PSI> gained 0.4 percent to 5,982.24, with foreign investors buying shares worth a net 125 million pesos ($2.78 million) while Vietnam <.VNI> rose 1.3 percent to a 3-1/2 year high. [ID:nL3N0KQ2K5] Major Southeast Asian markets reversed early gains, with Malaysia <.KLSE> sliding 0.6 percent to near seven-week lows ahead of a market holiday on Friday while Indonesian stocks <.JKSE> edged down 0.7 percent after a rally earlier in the week. Singapore <.FTSTI> edged down 0.1 percent, weighed down by commodities shares, including Wilmar International Ltd <WLIL.SI>.
