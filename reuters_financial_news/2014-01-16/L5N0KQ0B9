DUBAI, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Masraf Al Rayan <MARK.QA>, Qatar's largest sharia-compliant bank by market value, said on Thursday it had completed its acquisition of Islamic Bank of Britain (IBB).

Al Rayan did not disclose the terms of the purchase. IBB was majority-owned by another Qatari lender, Qatar International Islamic Bank <QIIB.QA>, which had been in discussions with Al Rayan over a sale since mid-2012.
