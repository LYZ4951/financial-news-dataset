MUNICH, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone will stand trial on bribery charges in Munich, according to a statement from a German court.

"Under current planning, the main trial should start in late April," the Munich court said in a statement on Thursday. Ecclestone, 82, was charged in July with bribing a German banker to smooth the sale of a stake in the motor racing business to private equity firm CVC [CVC.UL] eight years ago. [ID:nL6N0FN1TF]
