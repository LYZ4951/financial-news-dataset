Jan 16 (Reuters) - As Wall Street's biggest banks reported quarterly earnings this week, many of them have also offered a glimpse into the scale of their commodity market activity through a measure of trading risk called Value-at-Risk, or VaR.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> reported its commodity prices VaR rose slightly to $18 million in the fourth quarter from $17 million in the third quarter. The latest figure was down $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. VaR is the most amount of money that can be lost on 95 percent of the trading days during the period.  Goldman, typical of Wall Street banks, groups its commodities revenue under the fixed income category and does not break out the sector, often leaving VaR as one of the key risk-reward indicators that can measure commodities exposure.  For the quarter, fixed income revenue was $1.7 billion, up from $1.2 billion in the third quarter but down from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Goldman said net revenues for commodities were "essentially unchanged" for the year, compared with 2012. On a quarterly basis, it cited "significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and, to a lesser extent, interest rate products, currencies and commodities" behind the fourth-quarter year-over-year decline.
