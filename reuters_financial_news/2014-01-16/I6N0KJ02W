MILAN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Italy's banking system would not be at risk if the planned capital increase at No. 3 lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> failed to go through, the chairman of the supervisory board of Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> said on Thursday.

"I see absolutely no risk," Giovanni Bazoli said. Monte Paschi has had to delay its plans for a capital increase due to opposition from its main shareholder. On Wednesday Monte Paschi's chairman Alessandro Profumo said failure to carry out a 3 billion euro ($4 billion) cash call could pose a problem for the banking system as a whole.
