DUBAI, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, Saudi Arabia's largest listed lender, widely missed analyst expectations as it posted a 19.1 percent slump in its fourth-quarter net profit.

The bank made 1.55 billion riyals ($413.3 million) in the three months to December 31, compared with 1.91 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier, it said in a statement to the Saudi bourse on Thursday. Analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expected the bank to post a net profit of 1.99 billion riyals for the fourth quarter. [ID:nL6N0KG05T]
