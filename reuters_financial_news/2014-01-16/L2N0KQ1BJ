RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Most Latin American stock indexes fell on Thursday, led by Brazil's benchmark index, which tumbled on concern higher U.S. and Brazilian interest rates will choke growth and fuel-sales losses will crimp profit at state-run oil giant Petrobras.

The MSCI Latin America Index <.MILA00000PUS> fell 1.28 percent in afternoon trading. The Bovespa index <.BVSP>, which tracks the most-traded stocks on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, reversed early gains to fall 0.7 percent. Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> fell 0.4 percent. Petroleo Brasileiro SA <PETR4.SA>, as Petrobras is formally known, led the Bovespa lower, with its preferred shares, the company's most-traded class of stock, falling 2.12 percent and common shares shedding 2.3 percent. Petrobras accounted for about 267 points, or more than half, of the Bovespa's 409-point slide. Late on Wednesday, the Brazilian government said it was not considering an increase in gasoline and diesel fuel prices in June, denying a report in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. Petrobras' refining division has lost more than $12 billion in two years because of the government's fuel-pricing policy. This policy keeps domestic prices below world prices, forcing Petrobras to sell rising fuel imports at a loss. Local diesel prices are about 20 percent below world prices. The half-percentage-point increase in Brazil's benchmark interest rates by the central bank late Wednesday also helped drive stocks lower. The larger-than-expected increase, which took the base Selic rate to 10.5 percent, could slow an already sluggish economy. [ID:nL2N0KP0J6] Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil's largest non-government bank by assets, fell 2.2 percent. BRF SA, Brazil's largest chicken processor, fell 2.6 percent. In Mexico, America Movil <AMXL.MX> led the index lower, falling 0.88 percent to 14.57 pesos.
