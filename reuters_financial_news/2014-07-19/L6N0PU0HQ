BERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - German car parts supplier ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] believes buying U.S peer TRW Automotive Holdings Corp <TRW.N> would give it a better foothold in the market for self-driving and connected cars, its finance chief told a German paper.

Privately-held ZF Friedrichshafen said earlier this month it was in early stage talks with TRW, which makes airbags, electronics, and braking and steering equipment. [ID:nL6N0PM1M8] [ID:nL4N0PL4NL] CFO Konstantin Sauer said ZF Friedrichshafen was well placed in the areas of powertrains and chassis, but that other areas were growing in importance, highlighting internet-enabled devices and autonomous driving.  "TRW, with its years of market expertise, technology and products would be the perfect complement," Sauer was quoted as saying in an interview with Boersen-Zeitung on Saturday. Rival German car parts supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] is also investing heavily in such new technologies. [ID:nL6N0NL5H9] TRW has a market capitalisation of around $11 billion, so the deal would be a major acquisition for ZF Friedrichshafen, which had revenue of 16.84 billion euros ($22.8 billion) in 2013. Sauer declined to give details of financing for any deal in the interview saying only: "You can assume that we have thought long and hard about this to find a way that matches our company values."
