TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Two of Japan's three biggest banks saw profits fall at double-digit rates in the first quarter as gains in the value of shares the banks' owned grew at a far slower rate than last year, when government pro-growth pledges sparked a share price surge.

The biggest lender, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) <8306.T>, however, reported only a modest decline after managing to build on last year's stock-related gains. MUFG, Mizuho Financial Group <8411.T> and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) <8316.T> booked record profit in the year ended March thanks primarily to the stock market. But share prices have since cooled in tandem with sentiment towards Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policies. "Abenomics" also involved increasing the supply of money to bring down the cost of borrowing and simulate demand for loans. The action compelled banks to lower already-low interest rates, which in the first quarter continued to limit lending profit. MUFG, which owns about one-fifth of Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, reported net profit of 240.5 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in April-June from 255.3 billion yen a year earlier. Stock-related gains rose to 17.9 billion yen from 12.8 billion yen. Profit fell 38 percent to 154.7 billion yen at Mizuho, and on Wednesday, SMFG said profit fell 20 percent to 230.8 billion. Stock-related gains fell 42 percent at both. [ID:nL4N0Q016H] [ID:nL4N0PZ2MP] The three banks own substantial stakes in an array of major Japanese companies such as Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Central Japan Railway Co <9022.T>, so swings in the value of shares have significant impact on the banks' earnings. Japan's benchmark Nikkei share index <.N225> rose 2.3 percent in April-June, compared with 10 percent in the same period a year earlier. Shares of MUFG closed 0.9 percent higher ahead of the earnings, versus a 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark index <.N225>. Mizuho closed up 0.1 percent, and SMFG ended up 1.7 percent.
