July 31 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Thursday cut its credit ratings on Argentina to reflect its second default in more than 12 years a day after talks with a group of creditors collapsed with no deal to allow payment on its bonds.

The country's issuer default rating was cut to "RD" from "CC" and the discount bonds issued under foreign law to "D" from "CCC."
