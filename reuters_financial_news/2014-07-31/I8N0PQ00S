MUMBAI, July 31 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell nearly 1 percent on Thursday, marking its biggest single-day fall in nearly 2-1/2 weeks as foreign investors sales and expiry of July derivatives weighed on blue-chips such as Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS>.

HDFC provisionally fell 2.1 percent while ITC <ITC.NS> ended down 0.6 percent. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> provisionally lost 0.9 percent, marking its biggest single-day fall since July 11.  The index, however, gained 1.4 percent in July to notch up its third consecutive monthly gain.
