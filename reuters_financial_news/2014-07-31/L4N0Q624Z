SEOUL, July 31 (Reuters) - South Korean shares snapped a four-day rally as some investors sold for profit, while foreigners remained net buyers for a 13th straight session as prospects for higher share dividends from new government policies continued to attract offshore demand.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.3 percent at 2,076.12, with losses capped as foreign investors bought a net 467 billion won ($454.6 million) worth of local shares. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> fell 3.7 percent after reporting its worst quarterly profit in two years while remaining downbeat over third-quarter prospects. [ID:nL4N0Q32AS]
