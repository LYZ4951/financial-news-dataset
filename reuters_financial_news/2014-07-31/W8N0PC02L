WARSAW, July 31 (Reuters) - The Warsaw Stock Exchange aims to present its stance on a tie-up with Vienna bourse operator CEESEG within weeks, newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Pawel Tamborski said on Thursday.

"A representative of the biggest shareholder expects a relatively quick analysis and information, which would allow us to make a decision," Tamborski told reporters. "Cooperation with Vienna is a serious option and requires analysis. I expect to provide shareholders with detailed information within a few weeks." The state-controlled bourse, the biggest stock market in central Europe, wants to combine with Vienna bourse operator CEE Stock Exchange Group (CEESEG) to strengthen its position against in Frankfurt <DB1Gn.DE> and London <LSE.L>.
