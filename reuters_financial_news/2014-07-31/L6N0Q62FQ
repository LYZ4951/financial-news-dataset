PRAGUE, July 31 (Reuters) - Czech lender Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR> will likely post a 5 percent decline in net profit in the second quarter, dragged down by low interest rates in the domestic market and a slight rise in risk costs, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.

The average estimate of 12 analysts in the poll saw net profit at 3.01 billion Czech crowns ($146.52 million), versus 3.16 billion in the same period last year. Analysts said Komercni Banka, 60.4 percent owned by France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, could revise its guidance for revenue and loan growth lower after a similar move following first-quarter results. The third largest Czech bank by assets has said it expects loan growth of 3-5 percent and a revenue drop of 1 percent in 2014. "The year to date trends show in our opinion that even this revised outlook may not be achievable for the bank and will be lowered again," J&T Banka said in a preview note.
