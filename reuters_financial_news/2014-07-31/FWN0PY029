LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> reported a 32 percent increase in underlying first-half profit, helping it absorb an increase in the cost of compensating customers mis-sold loan insurance.

The bank, which is 25 percent-owned by the government having been rescued during the 2008 financial crisis, reported an underlying profit of 3.8 billion pounds ($6.4 billion), benefiting from an increased margin and improving economic conditions.
