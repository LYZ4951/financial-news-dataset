July 31 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's <GE.N> credit card unit, Synchrony Financial <SYF.N>, made a muted debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday as investors remained ambivalent about a consumer-led U.S. economic recovery.

Synchrony, the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States, raised $2.88 billion in the biggest U.S. initial public offering of the year so far. Synchrony's shares touched a high of $24 before slipping to $22.75, just below the offer price of $23 per share. [ID:nL4N0Q57DS]
