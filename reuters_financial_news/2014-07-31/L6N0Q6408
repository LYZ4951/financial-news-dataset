MOSCOW, July 31 (Reuters) - Russian broadcaster CTC Media <CTCM.O> reported on Thursday a 16 percent fall in second-quarter net profit to $26.7 million partly due to a weaker rouble.

Revenues decreased 11 percent to $184.3 million and operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) slid 21 percent to $45.4 million, with a 24.7 percent margin.
