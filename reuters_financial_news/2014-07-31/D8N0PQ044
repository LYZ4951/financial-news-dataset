NEW DELHI, July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday that he still hoped for a compromise to end India's opposition to a global deal that would address its concerns and help advance trade liberalisation, just hours before a deadline passed.

New Delhi has insisted that, in exchange for signing a trade facilitation agreement, it must see more progress on a parallel pact giving it more freedom to subsidise and stockpile food grains than is allowed by World Trade Organization rules.
