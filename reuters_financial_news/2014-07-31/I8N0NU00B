MUMBAI, July 31 (Reuters) - India's central bank said on Thursday it had appointed former Bank of Baroda <BOB.NS> Chairman S.S. Mundra as a deputy governor for a term of three years.

Mundra will look after departments including banking supervision, currency management, and financial stability, the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement. This portfolio was previously handled by former deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty, who had resigned in April. With the appointment of Mundra, the RBI now has four deputy governors.
