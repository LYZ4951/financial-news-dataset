TAIPEI, July 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan's financial regulators said on Thursday they plan to issue new rules to restrict foreign and local brokerages from publishing research reports on individual stocks.

One of the new rule would be to require brokerages not to mention target prices of an individual stock if their reports are picked up by local media, said an official of Financial Supervisory Commision. It was not immediately clear when the rules would take effect.
