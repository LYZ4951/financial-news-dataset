CAIRO, July 31 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was stable at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday and weakened slightly on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its most recent sale last Thursday, before the Muslim Eid holiday. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.40 pounds, one trader said, weaker than the rate of 7.39 pounds a week earlier.
