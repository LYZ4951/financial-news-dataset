MILAN, July 31 (Reuters) - UniCredit <CRDI.MI> has reached a deal to sell its 81.4 percent stake in DAB Bank AG <DRNG.DE> to BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, the Italian lender said in a statement on Thursday.

The agreed price of 4.78 euros per share values the stake at around 354 million euros ($473.97 million), the bank said.  UniCredit said it expects to book a net gain of around 180 million euros from the transaction.  The deal's closing is still subject to the approval of the relevant authorities and UniCredit Bank AG's supervisory board.
