NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Three people sustained minor injuries on Thursday when glass fell some 18 stories from a Manhattan high-rise building to the sidewalk below, fire officials said.

Officials were called to the building, which sits several blocks from Central Park, shortly before 9 a.m. on Thursday, a fire department spokesman said. Two people were hospitalized with minor injuries, while a third person declined medical assistance, the spokesman said.
