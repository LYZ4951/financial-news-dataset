TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) <8306.T> on Thursday said net profit fell 5.8 percent in April-June in part due to expenses after acquiring Thailand's Bank of Ayudhya PCL <BAY.BK>.

But the first-quarter profit fall at Japan's largest lender by assets was significantly smaller than rivals as it booked larger stock-related gains than a year-earlier period while others suffered declines. MUFG, which owns about one-fifth of Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, reported net profit of 240.5 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in April-June from 255.3 billion yen a year earlier. MUFG left its net profit forecast for the year ending March 31 at 950 billion yen, down 3.5 percent from a year prior and less than a 963 billion yen mean estimate of 19 analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll. Shares of MUFG closed 0.9 percent higher ahead of the earnings, versus a 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark index <.N225>.
