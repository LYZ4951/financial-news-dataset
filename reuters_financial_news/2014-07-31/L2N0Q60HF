July 31 (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp <CI.N> said on Thursday that its second-quarter profit and revenue rose as it took in more healthcare premiums and fees from increased customers in its commercial business.

Cigna reported net income of $573 million, or $2.12 per share, up from $505 million, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier. The company had 13.8 million people in its commercial business, up from 13.6 million a year earlier.
