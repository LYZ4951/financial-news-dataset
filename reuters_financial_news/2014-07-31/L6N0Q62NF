LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Argentina's debt insurance costs fell more than 400 basis points on Thursday in the five-year credit default swap market after the country went into default, but one-year credit default swaps rose.

Argentina defaulted for the second time in 12 years on Thursday after hopes for a midnight deal with holdout creditors were dashed. Investors continue to speculate that Argentina will eventually strike a deal with holdout investors, however, at least on a longer-term horizon. Argentina's 5-year CDS fell more than 400 basis points to 1,444 bps, according to Markit.
