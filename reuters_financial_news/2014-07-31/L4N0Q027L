SINGAPORE, July 31 (Reuters) - United Overseas Bank Ltd <UOBH.SI>, the smallest of Singapore's three banks, posted a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly profit and beat market estimates, boosted by an increase in net interest income and investment gains.

In a statement on Thursday, UOB said net profit for April-June quarter rose to S$808 million ($648 million) from S$783 million in the same period year ago period. The result was above the S$764 million mean estimate of seven analysts polled by Reuters. Net interest income increased 10.7 percent to S$1.12 billion, due to a higher loan base, the bank said.
