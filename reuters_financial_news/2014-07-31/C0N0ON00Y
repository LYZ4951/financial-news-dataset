BUENOS AIRES, July 31 (Reuters) - Argentine economy minister Axel Kicillof said on Thursday that the country was not in default and threatened court action if any bondholders demanded their money back.

Latin America's No.3 economy failed to clinch a deal in last-minute talks with holdout creditors, leaving it unable to comply with debt payments that fell due on July 30.

The government would not oppose an agreement between private parties, Kicillof said.
