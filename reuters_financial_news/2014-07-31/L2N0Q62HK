TORONTO, July 31 (Reuters) - Fairfax Financial Holdings <FFH.TO>, the Canadian property and casualty insurer run by investment authority Prem Watsa, said on Thursday it rebounded to profit in the second quarter from a year-earlier loss due to gains in its investment portfolio and stronger underwriting results.

The Toronto-based company said it earned $363.7 million, or $16.15 a share, in the quarter. That compared with a year-before loss of $157.8 million, or $8.55 a share. Fairfax, which has hedged the bulk of its stock portfolio since 2010, posted net investment gains of $409 million during the quarter as strength in its equity and bond investments more than offset losses from its equity hedges. That compared with a net investment loss of $415.7 million in the second quarter of 2013.  Fairfax said in a statement that 85 percent of the stock portfolio is currently hedged. Operating income from Fairfax's insurance and reinsurance operations was $202.2 million in the quarter, up from $187.5 million a year earlier, due to improved underwriting.
