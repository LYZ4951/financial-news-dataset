LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - British house prices rose in July at the slowest pace since April last year, gaining just 0.1 percent month-on-month, a survey from mortgage lender Nationwide showed on Thursday.

That compared with 1.0 percent growth in June and lagged the consensus in a Reuters poll for a 0.5 percent rise.
