ZURICH, July 31 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank <SNBN.S> swung to a first-half profit from a year-ago loss on Thursday, helped by gains from foreign currency positions.

The central bank posted a profit of 16.1 billion Swiss francs ($17.72 billion) for the first six months, 12.6 billion francs of this coming from gains on foreign currency.
