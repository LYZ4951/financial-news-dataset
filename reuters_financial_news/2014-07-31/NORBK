OSLO, July 31 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank will not sell any Norwegian crowns in August to buy foreign exchange for the country's sovereign wealth fund, the bank said on Thursday, in line with its practice in recent months.

The bank earlier said it did not expect to buy any foreign currency over the coming months and it could even buy crowns later in the year.
