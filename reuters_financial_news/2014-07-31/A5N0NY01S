PRAGUE, July 31 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank said on Thursday it would keep the crown currency weak into 2016, delaying the planned exit from currency interventions that help keep monetary policy loose amid a lack of inflationary pressures.

The bank had previously said it would maintain its pledge to intervene against the crown firming above around 27 to the euro at least until the second quarter of 2015, which was already a delay from original timing.
