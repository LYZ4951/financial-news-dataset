WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. regulatory panel tasked with policing the biggest risks to the financial system said on Thursday it plans to launch a "more focused analysis" of the asset management industry.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council also said that it agreed in a closed door meeting not to rescind "systemically important" designations for American International Group <AIG.N> and GE Capital <GE.N>.
