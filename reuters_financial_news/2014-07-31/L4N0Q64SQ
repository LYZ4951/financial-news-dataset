SINGAPORE, July 31 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd <SGXL.SI> said on Thursday its net profit fell 12 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter as a result of its struggling securities business, but said it expects share trading volumes to recover.

In a statement after trading hours on Thursday, SGX reporteda net profit for the quarter ended June of S$77.4 million ($62.1 million), down from S$87.6 million in the same period a year earlier. The result was just ahead of the S$75.7 million average forecast of six analysts polled by Reuters.  "We expect our securities business to recover from a tough FY2014 as volatility normalizes from the lows we had experienced in the past year," the exchange said in its statement.  SGX, Asia's third-largest listed bourse by market value, saw a 23 percent fall in the average daily value of shares traded on its market in the latest fiscal year compared to the previous one.
