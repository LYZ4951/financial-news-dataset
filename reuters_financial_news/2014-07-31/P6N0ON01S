PARIS, July 31 (Reuters) - European shares were steady in early trade on Thursday as investors combed through a batch of corporate results from blue-chips such as Sanofi <SASY.PA>, Anheuser-Busch InBev <ABI.BR> and Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L>.

Shares in Sanofi surged 4 percent after the French drugmaker raised its full-year profit forecast, while German sportswear company Adidas <ADSGn.DE> sank 9 percent after saying it will scale back plans to expand in Russia. At 0709 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.09 percent at 1,367.91 points, after losing 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
