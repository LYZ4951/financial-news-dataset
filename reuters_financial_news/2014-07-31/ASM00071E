LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - British construction company Balfour Beatty said on Thursday it had terminated talks with Carillion <CLLN.L> over a possible 3 billion pound ($5.08 billion) merger, only days after the possible deal was revealed.

Balfour said in statement that it had ended the talks after Carillion said it would only progress with a merger if its Parsons Brinckerhoff business remained part of the deal.
