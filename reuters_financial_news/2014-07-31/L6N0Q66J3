MOSCOW, July 31 (Reuters) - The inclusion of Gazprombank <GZPRI.RTS> in the latest round of EU sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis will not affect the bank's financial stability or its ability to fulfil obligations to lenders and investors, the company said on Thursday.

"The imposition of sanctions by the European Union on a number of Russian companies and banks will not hurt the financial resilience and stable work of Gazprombank," it said in a statement.
