WARSAW, July 31 (Reuters) - Poland's No.3 lender Bank Zachodni WBK <BZW.WA> will look at takeover opportunities in Poland, but does not need to do deals to achieve its target of profit growth, the group's chief executive said on Thursday.

"If there's a right occasion, then together with our colleagues from Santander we'll look at it, but the critical mass we already achieved is so big that it's not a condition for further growth," CEO Mateusz Morawiecki told Reuters.
