ZURICH, July 31 (Reuters) - Swiss bank Credit Suisse, one of the biggest players in "dark pools", on Thursday became the latest major European bank to say it was caught up in an investigation into alternative trading venues.    "Credit Suisse is responding to inquiries from various governmental and regulatory authorities concerning the operation of its alternative trading systems, and is cooperating with those requests," the Zurich-based lender said in its second-quarter report, published on Thursday.
