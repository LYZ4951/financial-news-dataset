HONG KONG, July 31 (Reuters) - Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <0001.HK>, Hong Kong's second-largest developer, posted a 59 percent rise in first-half net profit as steep discounts boosted sales and attracted end-users once scared off by tightening measures.

Cheung Kong, controlled by Asia's richest man Li Ka-shing, has recorded property sales of about HK$19.8 billion ($2.55 billion) so far this year, the highest of all Hong Kong developers, according to BNP Paribas. The company set an annual target of HK$30 billion for Hong Kong property sales this year.  It reported a first-half net profit of HK$21.35 billion ($2.75 billion) on Thursday. That beat an average forecast for a profit of HK$20.13 billion, according to three analysts polled by Reuters.
