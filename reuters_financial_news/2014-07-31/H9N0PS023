HONG KONG, July 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares posted their best monthly performance since 2012 on Thursday, though gains for the day were capped by weakness in a few Chinese heavyweight companies.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.1 percent at 24,756.85 points, its eighth straight winning session. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also edged up 0.1 percent. Both indexes posted their third monthly gain in a row, with the benchmark index up 6.8 percent and the HSCE 7.7 percent. July was the best month for the Hang Seng since September 2012 and for the H-share index since January 2012. Hong Kong-listed Chinese property developers led gains. The sector has rallied strongly in recent weeks on expectations that more local governments in China will relax restrictions on home purchases in a bid to avert a sharper correction in the cooling property market. China Resources Land <1109.HK> climbed 3.6 percent after Barclays upgraded the developer to "overweight" from "equalweight". China Overseas Land & Investment <0688.HK> surged 4.6 percent.  In a research note on Thursday, Barclays said they "believe the sector rally has further to go," but "expect only the quality developers to continue to outperform, as they gain market share."
