MADRID, July 31 (Reuters) - Santander <SAN.MC> is looking at the Spanish retail banking unit of Britain's Barclays <BARC.L>, Chief Executive Javier Marin said on Thursday, though added the bank may not be interested.

"We are looking at it, we are analysing it, but I don't think this is a clear target ... that can add value (for us)," Marin told a news conference after the bank released second quarter earnings.
