LISBON, July 31 (Reuters) - Portugal's CMVM securities market regulator extended its ban on short selling in shares of Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> for two more days following a 42-percent plunge in the troubled lender's shares on Thursday, the first day of the ban.

Investors took fright at massive losses and revelations of potential illegal activity at the country's largest listed bank revealed late on Wednesday, complicating the bank's ambition of raising capital without seeking state aid. {ID:nL6N0Q63RF] CMVM said in a statement the ban will be valid for two more trading days in order to prevent possible speculative deals. Short selling essentially bets on a stock losing value and can cause shares to fall faster.  BES shares have lost almost 80 percent of their value since the start of the year, mostly in the past few weeks as several holding companies of its founding Espirito Santo family failed to repay debts and subsequently requested creditor protection.
