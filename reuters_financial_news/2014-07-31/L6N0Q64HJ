FRANKFURT, July 31 (Reuters) - Buyout group Hellman & Friedman has started preparations for a potential stock market listing of Scout24 just months after buying the German classified advertising group from Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE>, three sources familiar with the matter said.

The private equity investor has chosen STJ Advisors to organise the process, in which Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> are expected to act as so-called global coordinators with the help of Jefferies, JP Morgan <JPM.N> and Barclays <BARC.L>, they added.  Scout24, the advisors and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment, while STJ and Hellman & Friedman were not immediately available for comment.
