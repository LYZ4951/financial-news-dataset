July 31 (Reuters) - Asset manager Legg Mason Inc's <LM.N> quarterly profit more than doubled, driven by increased assets under management and lower operating expenses.

Net income attributable to the company rose to $72.2 million, or 61 cents per share, in the first quarter ended June 30, from $47.8 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.
