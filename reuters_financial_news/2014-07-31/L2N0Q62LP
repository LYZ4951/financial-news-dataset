BOGOTA, July 31 (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent on Thursday to keep a lid on inflation as the economy grows faster than expected this year. It was the fourth straight month in which the bank has raised rates.

The following is a translation by Reuters of the bank's statement accompanying the decision:  The board of directors of the Bank of the Republic in its meeting today decided to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, and set it at 4.25 percent. For this decision, the board took the following factors into consideration:  After rising and nearing the target of 3 percent more quickly than expected, annual consumer inflation in June fell, standing at 2.79 percent. These movements in inflation have mainly been the consequence of changes in the prices of food and regulated items. The average of basic inflation measures have shown a similar behavior and inflation expectations for the next year and subsequent years, is maintained at around or slightly above 3 percent.   Average growth in Colombia's main trading partners has been weaker than forecast months ago due to the sharp fall in United States' GDP in the first quarter and to the lower growth in several countries in the region.   Nonetheless, based on real and recent financial indicators, the bank's technical team continues to forecast a greater dynamic in external demand in the coming quarters. Revenue from the mining and energy sectors continues at a high level but with a tendency to fall.  In Colombia, recent data have prompted an upward revision in the growth forecast for the economy in 2014. As is well known, GDP growth in the first quarter was above what had been predicted before, driven in part by consumption and investment in construction of civil works and buildings. The good performance of these areas will probably continue for the rest of the year. Additionally, consumer confidence has improved, consumer credit has stopped decelerating, retail sales maintain their strong dynamic and the unemployment rate has shown a downward trend. All of this suggests that real spending by homes will continue dynamic for this year. In consequence, the new forecast growth range in 2014 of the bank's technical team is for between 4.2 percent and 5.8 percent with 5 percent the most likely figure.  Aggregate demand has maintained strong growth in the context of a near-full use of productive capacity close to full employment. At the same time, inflation expectations have been close to, or slightly above, 3 percent. All this occurs in an environment in which credit growth has increased and real interest rates for loans are situated at levels that stimulate spending. In the circumstances described, the Board considered appropriate to increase the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points.
