HANOI, July 31 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.7 percent at the break on Thursday in thin trade as investors cautiously picked up shares following a central bank report on the arrest of senior bankers.

The police arrested three former executives of Vietnam Construction Bank, a small unlisted lender based in the Mekong Delta province of Long An, on Tuesday for violating regulations on economic management, the State Bank of Vietnam has said in a statement. "Local investors have been following the consequences of this scandal before giving any investment decision," said Nguyen Thanh Lam, deputy manager of Maybank Kim Eng Securities. PetroVietnam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's biggest listed company, gained 0.9 percent and dairy firm Vinamilk <VNM.HM> rose 0.74 percent. Volume reached 35.9 million shares at midday, well below 112 million shares traded on Monday, the day before the arrests, based on Reuters data.
