SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, July 31 (Reuters) - Australian shares added 0.3 percent on Thursday to hit another  six-year high with the banking sector and an uptick on Wall Street supporting gains.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended higher overnight after the Federal Reserve gave a rosier assessment of the U.S. economy while reaffirming that it is in no hurry to raise interest rates.  The banking sector climbed higher, led by Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> which added 0.7 percent to trade at a record high of A$83.74. National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> rose 0.6 percent, while Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> climbed 0.8 percent, and said it has appointed Dave Curran as the new chief information officer. [ID:nWNBS00KG7] Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPL.AX> dropped 1.6 percent after news the company's planned $2.68 billion share buyback from Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L> was on the brink of failing. [ID:nL4N0Q57O9] The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> gained 19 points to 5,641.9 by 0140 GMT, a six-year high and marking its third consecutive session of gains. "In the past 15 trading days, 12 have been positive prints and one of the three down days was a fall of a point - showing July has been quite a bullish month," said Evan Lucas, IG's market strategist in a note to clients.  The benchmark is on track to jump 4.4 percent for the month, which would be its biggest one-month gain in a year.  The ASX 200 has been trading on an upward trajectory since mid-July, underpinned by Wall Street moves to record highs and a brighter outlook for China, Australia's largest export market.  Miners tugged the market lower as iron ore futures in China and Singapore fell on a supply glut. Global iron ore producer BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> slipped 0.3 percent, while Lynas Corporation Ltd <LYC.AX> slumped 13.4 percent after issuing a trading update and saying that it continues to "work with Nomura and its exisitng financiers regarding the potential restructure of its existing financing facilities." [ID:nASXnyWp3] Elsewhere, investors shrugged off data that showed export prices fell 7.9 percent in the second quarter, while building approvals fell 5 percent in June. [ID:nS9N0MU01Q][ID:nS9N0MU01O] Directors of Dimerix Bioscience Ltd <DBX.AX> have withdrawn the IPO of shares in the company. [ID:nWNBS00KGB] New Zealand stocks were fractionally firmer with the benchmark NZX-50 index <.NZ50> up 5 points or 0.1 percent to 5,163.53, with modest lifts for some leaders and continued appetite for medium and small-cap stocks. The biggest move was from Australian-based gold miner Oceana <OGC.NZ>, which operates two mines in New Zealand and reported a second quarter loss in due in part to the high kiwi dollar. It last traded down 12.3 percent at NZ$3.42. Among top-10 stocks Fisher and Paykel Healthcare <FPH.NZ>, and Telecom Corp <TEL.NZ> posted gains of more than 1 percent, while discount retailer the Warehouse <WHS.NZ> and telecommunications network operator Chorus <CNU.NZ> were also well bid.
