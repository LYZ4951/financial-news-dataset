SAO PAULO, July 31 (Reuters) - Brazilian homebuilder PDG Realty SA <PDGR3.SA> likely faced a surge of sales cancellations in the second quarter, weighing on revenue and net income as an economic downturn scared off clients, according to a Reuters survey of analysts.

High inflation and rising interest rates have battered consumer confidence, leading to more canceled contracts as PDG tries to speed up new construction and execute a tricky turnaround. Even though the company nearly quadrupled project launches from a year ago, net revenue likely fell 12 percent to 1.0 billion reais ($440 million), according to the average forecast of seven analysts. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, is expected to rise to 167 million reais, more than three times EBITDA a year ago, when PDG was still reeling from cost overruns due to a failed expansion strategy. Five analysts in the survey projected a second-quarter net loss, ranging from 10 million to 42 million reais. Two analysts forecast a profit around 4 million reais.
