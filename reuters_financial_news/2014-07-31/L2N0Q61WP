July 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. judge overseeing Argentina's dispute with a group of creditors said a hearing he has set for Friday morning in the case will be "regarding the recent default by the Republic of Argentina," according to a court filing posted Thursday.

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Griesa set the hearing for 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Friday in New York.
