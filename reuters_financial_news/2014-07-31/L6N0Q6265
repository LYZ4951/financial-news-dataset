LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> said its first half performance had strengthened the chances of the bank being allowed to pay its first dividend since being rescued by the government during the 2008 financial crisis.

Lloyds said it will apply to Britain's financial regulator in the second half of the year to restart dividends at a "modest" level.
