TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Japan's new top financial regulator is keeping the pressure on regional banks to consolidate, urging them to consider tie-ups and mergers to improve their profits and capital positions, said people involved in the process.

Kiyoshi Hosomizo, appointed commission of the Financial Services Agency early this month, told a midmonth off-the-record meeting of regional bank officials that action was needed, according to people who attended the meeting. "To strengthen profitability and make capital policies, one of the various choices for swift action would naturally be tie-ups or mergers," Hosomizo was quoted as saying. "I would like you to show leadership and proactively come to grips with these various issues. This means taking action where you can." An FSA representative said the agency was not immediately able to comment.
