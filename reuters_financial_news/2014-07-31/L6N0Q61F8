DUBAI, July 31 (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates stock markets may reopen with a firm tone on Thursday after three days of Eid holidays, while other major Gulf markets will stay closed until next week.

On their last day of trade before the holidays, Dubai's index <.DFMGI> rose 1.9 percent and Abu Dhabi <.ADI> gained 1.1 percent on strength in banks, after several large ones reported healthy earnings, and property developers. Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> is expected to announce second-quarter earnings in the next few days, which could spur interest in the stock. In another positive signal for the Dubai market, property developer Damac <DMCq.L>, now listed in London, announced on Wednesday that it would let investors convert its Global Depositary Receipts into shares that would be listed in Dubai. Global markets had a modestly positive tone while the UAE markets were closed; MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> is down 0.4 percent on Thursday morning but still up 0.4 percent from its level when Gulf markets went on holiday at the start of this week. However, it is by no means clear that any rise in the UAE markets would be part of an extended rally. The latest monthly Reuters survey of 15 leading Middle East investment managers, published on Thursday, showed managers had become considerably more bearish towards the UAE because of concerns about high valuations and regulation. Only 7 percent intend to increase UAE equity allocations in the next three months and 47 percent to decrease them, compared to ratios of 27 percent and 33 percent a month ago. The ratio of managers who are bullish towards the UAE is the lowest since the survey was launched last September; the ratio of bearish managers is the highest. [ID:nL6N0Q208U] In Dubai, Gulf Navigation <GNAV.DU> may attract interest on Thursday after it reported a 3.2 million dirham ($860,000) profit for the second quarter, swinging from a 10.1 million dirham loss a year earlier.
