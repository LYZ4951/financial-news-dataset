MADRID, July 31 (Reuters) - Spain's Santander <SAN.MC>, which has a big presence in Latin America and operations in Argentina, does not expect any impact from a potential sovereign debt default in the country, Chief Executive Javier Marin said on Thursday.

Argentina defaulted for the second time in 12 years after hopes for a midnight deal with holdout creditors were dashed. [ID:nL6N0Q60RM] Marin was also asked on a conference call following second-quarter earnings whether the bank was interested in investing in Portugal's loss-making Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS>. Marin said the bank always looked at opportunities for acquisitions.
