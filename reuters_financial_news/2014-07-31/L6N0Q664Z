ACCRA, July 31 (Reuters) - Ghana accepted 400.01 million cedis ($115.94 million) worth of bids for a three-year bond and paid a slightly higher yield of 25.4 percent in an oversubscribed bond sale on Thursday, the central bank said.    The bond, open to offshore investors, was the first of two auctions planned for the second half of this year to boost government finances, deputy head of treasury Collins Antwi said.

A similar sale held in May attracted a yield of 24.4 percent. Antwi told Reuters a total of 644.15 million cedis worth of bids were tendered.
