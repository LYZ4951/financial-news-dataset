WARSAW, July 31 (Reuters) - Polish lender Bank Zachodni WBK <BZW.WA>, a unit of Spain's Banco Santander <SAN.MC>, reported a 20-percent rise in its second quarter profit, helped by a higher net interest income, it said on Thursday.

The third largest Polish bank in terms of assets said its net profit rose to 504 million zlotys ($162.4 million) year-on-year, broadly in line with the 496 million expected by analysts polled by Reuters.
