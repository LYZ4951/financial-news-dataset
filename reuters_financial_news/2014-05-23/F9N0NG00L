PARIS, May 23 (Reuters) - Cutting the European Central Bank's deposit rate into negative territory is a policy option for the ECB but would not be an exchange rate policy, Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said on Friday.

Coeure stressed that the ECB's Governing Council had been unanimous in agreeing its willingness to use conventional and unconventional policy instruments, if needed. Reuters reported last week that the ECB is preparing a package of policy options for its June meeting, including cuts in all its interest rates and targeted measures aimed at boosting lending to small- and mid-sized firms. [ID:L6N0O05MM] "It is an option," Coeure said of the negative deposit rate, which would essentially see the ECB charge banks for holding their money overnight, adding "this is not exchange rate policy."
