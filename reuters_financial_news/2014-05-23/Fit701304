May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded SNS REAAL N.V. (SNS  REAAL) insurance entities, SRLEV N.V. and REAAL Schadeverzekeringen  N.V.(together, REAAL Insurance), to Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings  'BBB' from 'BBB+'. The Outlooks are Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  The downgrade reflects REAAL Insurance's weak profitability, high financial  leverage and Fitch's expectation that these metrics will remain under pressure,  impairing the insurance group's financial flexibility. The ratings also reflect  uncertainty over the future ownership of REAAL Insurance, following the  nationalisation of SNS REAAL, and in light of the Dutch State's commitment to  the sale of REAAL Insurance. Fitch views REAAL Insurance's profitability and interest coverage as weak. REAAL  Insurance posted a EUR625m loss in 2013 (2012: loss of EUR149m). Fitch believes  that REAAL Insurance's underlying profitability is likely to remain under  pressure in the coming years, due to the low interest-rate environment,  difficult domestic economic conditions and fierce competition in the Dutch  insurance market.  REAAL Insurance's financial leverage was 42% at end-2013 (2012: 48%), which  Fitch views as manageable, as the group is still restructuring. However, this  level is high for the rating and relative to peers. The existing intragroup positions between SNS Bank N.V. and REAAL Insurance have  been reduced, which Fitch views positively. This action reduces group complexity  and makes the bank and the insurers more independent from a capital and  liquidity perspective ahead of the sale of the insurance operations.  In December 2013, the European Commission (EC) announced its final decision  concerning the restructuring plan of SNS REAAL, after it was nationalised in  February 2013. As a fully owned subsidiary of SNS REAAL, REAAL Insurance was  also nationalised. In the restructuring plan, the Dutch State has committed to,  among other measures, the sale of the group's insurance operations. The decision  generates uncertainty over the future of REAAL Insurance. REAAL Insurance's ratings are underpinned by its strong presence in the Dutch  insurance market, notably in life and pensions. SRLEV N.V. now ranks third among  Dutch life insurers, with a market share of around 16%. REAAL  Schadeverzekeringen is a significant non-life player, with a 6% market share. REAAL Insurance's capital position is also sound, in Fitch's opinion. At  end-December 2013, REAAL Insurance's regulatory solvency was 172% (2012: 176%),  after receiving EUR250m from SNS REAAL in the form of a capital injection during  2013. As long as the insurance activities remain within the state-owned group  SNS REAAL, the nationalisation should not affect the solvency of the insurance  entities.  The EC also decided in 2013 to disallow SRLEV N.V. from paying the coupons of  its subordinated bonds, which in Fitch's view, continues to impair REAAL  Insurance's financial flexibility. However, the Dutch State has demonstrated its  support for several financial institutions, including SNS REAAL in recent years.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Key ratings drivers for a downgrade are a further material loss in 2014, a  decline in the regulatory solvency ratio to below 125% or financial leverage  remaining above 40%.
