LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - European shares steadied near last week's six-year highs on Friday, with investors trading cautiously ahead of Ukrainian and European election results.

At 0709 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares was flat at 1,366.25 points after closing 0.1 percent higher in the previous session. Investors kept a close eye on Ukraine, where more than a dozen servicemen were reported killed on Thursday in a clash with pro-Russian separatists, fuelling security concerns ahead of Sunday's presidential election, seen as crucial for its fragile democracy.

Polling kicked off on Thursday when Britain and the Netherlands voted, with right-wing, anti-EU parties expected to attract a surge of protest votes in many countries. [ID:nL6N0O81SN] Britain's anti-EU UKIP party made strong gains in local elections, according to early results on Friday, while a Dutch exit poll for the EU elections indicated that the anti-Islam, Eurosceptic Freedom Party had fallen well short of its goal of topping the poll.
