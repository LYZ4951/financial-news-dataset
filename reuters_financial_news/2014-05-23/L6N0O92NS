LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - HSBC's <HSBA.L> Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver told shareholders at the bank's annual meeting that it had no plans to follow rivals by significantly re-shaping its investment banking business.

"There's no real need to change ours. I don't see any need to exit large chunks of the business. We will continue to invest in the organic growth of GBM (investment bank arm Global Banking and Markets)," he said.
