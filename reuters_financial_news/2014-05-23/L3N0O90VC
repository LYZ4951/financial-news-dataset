SEOUL, May 23 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged up to a fresh 5-1/2 month closing high on Friday, finishing the week modestly higher as persistent foreign inflows offset profit taking by retail and institutional investors.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.1 percent at 2,017.17 points, the highest close since Dec. 2, 2013. The index eked out a 0.2 gain for the week.Offshore investors positioned as net buyers for a ninth straight session, picking up 128 billion Korean won ($125 million) worth of KOSPI shares. The won <KRW=> was little changed heading into the weekend, with demand from exporters for month-end settlements and stock inflows matched by caution over possible dollar-buying intervention by local authorities.
