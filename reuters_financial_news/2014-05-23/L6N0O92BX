COPENHAGEN, May 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Danish software provider Simcorp <SIM.CO> trade down 7 percent at 1018 GMT on Friday after a disappointing first-quarter report released late on Thursday.

Operating profit fell to 4.9 million euros ($66.96 million) from 7.0 million in the same period last year. "The main cause is that Simcorp has been unable to secure any major orders in Q1 2014," Handelsbanken says in a note to its clients.  The bank said that first-quarter operating profit was 48 percent lower than the market had expected. Separately, Thomson Reuters data showed a market forecast of 8.5 million euros for the first quarter, implying a 42 percent earnings miss. "The sale of new licenses is off to a slower start in 2014 compared to what we saw in 2013," says chief executive Klaus Holse, adding that he is pleased that customer demand for professional services continues to be strong.
