VIENNA, May 23 (Reuters) - Austrian insurer Uniqa's <UNIQ.VI> first-quarter earnings before tax fell 30.3 percent to 81.4 million euros ($111.16 million), but rose by a fifth excluding a gain of 49.1 million euros a year ago from selling hotel assets, it said on Friday.

Its combined ratio, a measure of profitability in the property and accident segments, improved to 97.8 percent from 98.3 percent a year earlier. It stuck to its forecast for a significant gain in 2014 profit, noting its business in Ukraine and Russia was growing despite the political crisis between the two countries.
