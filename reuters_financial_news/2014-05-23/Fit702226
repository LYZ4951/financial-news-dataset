May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings assigned the following ratings to Guggenheim Private Debt Fund Note Issuer, LLC (Guggenheim PDFNI) on May 22, 2014.   -- $41,842,106 class A notes, series A-5, 'Asf', Outlook Stable; -- $6,973,684 class B notes, series B-5, 'BBBsf', Outlook Stable; -- $8,600,877 class C notes, series C-5, 'BBsf', Outlook Stable; -- $5,811,404 class D notes, series D-5, 'Bsf', Outlook Stable; -- $2,245,614 class E1 notes, series E1-5, not rated; -- $10,666,666 class E2 notes, series E2-5, not rated; -- $16,842,106 limited liability company membership interests, series 5, not  rated. A full list of rating affirmations on existing notes follows at the end of this  release. Fitch assigned ratings to the new notes issued commensurate with the fifth  funding occurring on May 22, 2014 and also affirmed its ratings on the notes  that were issued pursuant to the previous funding dates. Guggenheim PDFNI (the  issuer) is a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) transaction that closed in  July 2012 and had its first, second and third funding dates in July 2012,  October 2012 and March 2013, respectively. The fourth funding date closed  recently in April 2014.  The transaction is managed by Guggenheim Partners  Investment Management, LLC (GPIM).  The fifth funding date will be the final funding date for Guggenheim PDFNI.   Pursuant to the fifth funding date, the issuer has drawn approximately $93  million of cash from investors and has issued a commensurate $76.1 million of  new notes, each designated as 'series 5', including approximately $12.9 million  of first-loss notes that are not rated by Fitch. In addition, approximately  $16.8 million was issued in the form of LLC interests, which are also not rated  by Fitch. The notes and LLC interests were issued in the same proportion as the  initial capital structure, as was contemplated at the transaction's closing. All  notes from each series are cross-collateralized by the entire collateral  portfolio, which is expected to consist of approximately $1.2 billion of broadly  syndicated loans and private debt investments (PDIs) as well as approximately  $71.3 million of cash.  The fifth funding draws on all outstanding commitments in Guggenheim PDFNI.  Total commitments made to the transaction to date totaled $1.237 billion, but  approximately $20 million had failed to fund at the fourth and fifth funding  dates.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  Fitch analyzed the current portfolio as represented to Fitch by GPIM and  included five additional assets expected to be purchased with the proceeds from  the fifth funding, as well as an additional loan purchase made from the fourth  funding date that is expected to close.  Fitch also analyzed a 'Fitch-Stressed'  portfolio that accounted for the worst-case portfolio concentrations permitted  by the indenture (which is further detailed in Fitch's press release 'Fitch  Rates Guggenheim Private Debt Fund Note Issuer, LLC' dated July 12, 2012).  Fitch's cash flow modeling analysis of both portfolios indicated that each class  of notes performs in line with the ratings assigned or affirmed, as applicable.  Fitch therefore assigned the ratings to the 'series 5' notes as indicated above.  Fitch has affirmed the existing 'series 1,' 'series 2,' 'series 3' and 'series  4' notes based on the analysis described above as well as the stable performance  of the transaction thus far. The April 4, 2014 trustee report indicated that all  collateral quality tests, concentration limitations, and coverage tests were in  compliance. All rated notes received their full interest and commitment fees on  the April payment date. Also on this payment date, approximately $7.5 million of  excess spread was redirected to the principal collection account for investment  in future collateral, increasing the degree of collateral coverage for the  notes.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Standard sensitivity analysis was conducted on the Fitch-stressed portfolio at  close in July 2012, as described in Fitch's corporate CDO criteria. The  transaction performed within the expectations of each respective rating in these  scenarios.  Given the stable portfolio performance since the closing date and the unchanged  investment guidelines of the portfolio, Fitch determined that the results of the  initial sensitivity analysis are sufficient for the transaction following the  fifth funding and therefore did not update the initial sensitivity analysis.  Initial Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivity are further described in the  commentary published on July 12, 2012.
