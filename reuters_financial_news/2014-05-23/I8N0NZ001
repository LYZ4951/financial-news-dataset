MUMBAI, May 23 (Reuters) - Reliance Communications <RLCM.NS> surged as much as 3.6 percent after the Financial Times reported that the Indian company was in talks with China's Citic Telecom <1833.HK> over an undersea cable joint venture, citing unnamed people familiar with the talks.

If completed, the move would create a 50-50 joint venture valuing Reliance Communications' cable assets at $1 billion, the newspaper reported on Thursday. [ID:nL3N0O83GG]
