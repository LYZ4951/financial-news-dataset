May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised Eurasia Drilling Company Limited's (EDC) Outlook to Positive from Stable and affirmed its Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'BB'. A full list of ratings actions is at the end of this release. The Positive Outlook reflects our expectation that EDC will maintain solid  credit metrics and should be free cash flow (FCF) positive in 2015-2017 as it  approaches the end of its investment cycle in the Caspian Sea. EDC has a strong  market position and will remain the largest on-shore driller in Russia in the  medium term. The Positive Outlook also reflects the favourable business  environment as Russian oil & gas companies continue to maintain high drilling  volumes to battle natural oil flow declines.  EDC is the largest drilling company in Russia with a 29% market share in 2013  (by metres drilled, excluding offshore). Its ratings are constrained to the 'BB'  category due to high customer concentration and limited geographical  diversification beyond Russia. In 2013, OAO LUKOIL <LKOH.MM> (BBB/Negative) accounted for  around two-thirds of EDC's revenue, and EDC's diversification strategy will be  challenged as OJSC OC Rosneft, EDC's second-largest customer, announced it will  almost fully curtail cooperation with the company.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Positive Outlook The Positive Outlook reflects that completion risks have significantly reduced  with commissioning of Neptune, its third jack-up rig in the Caspian Sea. We  expect that the company's capital intensity will fall, leading to positive FCF  in 2015-2017. EDC's credit metrics should remain solid despite lower on-shore  drilling in 2014 due to the loss of Rosneft, its second-largest customer. We  expect that EDC's key customers, LUKOIL and JSC Gazprom Neft <SIBN.MM> (BBB/Negative),  will maintain high drilling volumes to increase yield from their mature  brownfields and bring greenfields on-line.   Russia's Largest Drilling Company EDC is the largest drilling company in Russia, with a 29% market share in 2013.  It operates in all Russia's key oil regions and is predominantly involved in  onshore drilling, although its offshore business on the Caspian Sea shelf has  expanded considerably over the past few years. EDC's operational scale remains  constrained compared with that of larger, global oilfield services companies,  such as Halliburton Company <HAL.N> (A-/Stable) and Nabors Industries Inc. [NBRIN.UL] (Nabors,  BBB/Negative).  EDC has a relatively modern fleet that at end-2013 included 255 land drilling  and sidetracking rigs, 427 workover rigs, and three jack-up rigs for offshore  drilling. In 2013, EDC's total drilling volumes reached 6,264 thousand metres,  up 3.5% year-on-year, while horizontal meters reached 1,296 thousand metres, up  50.3% yoy.  LUKOIL Dominates, Rosneft Departs LUKOIL, Russia's largest private oil company, remains EDC's top customer with  57% of onshore drilling volumes and 66% of revenues in 2013. We acknowledge the  long-term relations between EDC and LUKOIL as mutually beneficial but view the  high customer concentration as a rating constraint. EDC has been trying to  diversify its customer base but this strategy has been challenged as Rosneft  announced in 2014 it will develop its in-house oilfield service business and  will almost fully curtail cooperation with EDC. Rosneft accounted for nearly a quarter of EDC's land drilling volumes in 2013  and 20% of onshore revenues. Therefore, we expect that LUKOIL's share in EDC's  revenues and earnings will increase in 2014 and a significant diversification of  EDC's customer base is unlikely over the medium term. In our modelling we assume  that EDC's drilling volumes will decline in 2014 by 10-15% yoy, although its  higher-margin horizontal drilling and offshore drilling volumes should increase,  supporting its operating cash flows.   Caspian Offshore Drilling On-track EDC continues to step up its offshore operations in the Caspian Sea. At  end-2013, EDC operated three jack-up rigs there, following commissioning of the  Neptune rig in 2013. A fourth rig, Mercury, is currently under construction and  EDC expects to commission it at end-2014. EDC has secured a strong position in  the Caspian region, the importance of which for oil exploration is growing. In  2013, offshore drilling accounted for 5% and 16% of the company's revenue and  net income, respectively, largely flat yoy.   Favourable Business Environment Fitch believes that the outlook remains favourable for the industry, as Russian  oil majors continue fighting production decline at Western Siberian brownfields,  developing greenfields and tapping into shale oil deposits, which requires  drilling more complex wells and leads to a significant increase in horizontal  drilling. Based on Fitch's Brent price deck of USD96/bbl in 2014 and USD91/bbl  in 2015, we forecast that Russian oil companies will keep up their upstream  capex, which in 2013 reached USD8.3bn for LUKOIL (Russian capex only, up 18%  yoy), and USD4.2bn for JSC Gazprom Neft (BBB/Negative, up 46% yoy), a sizable  portion of which was spent on drilling.   Low Leverage to Remain At end-2013 EDC's FFO adjusted net leverage was 0.6x, down from 0.8x at  end-2012, while its FFO fixed charge cover reached nearly 15.5x, up from 10.3x.  We expect EDC to maintain a conservative financial policy and forecast that in  2014-2017 FFO adjusted net leverage will not exceed 1x in 2014-2017 and FFO  fixed charge cover will stay above 10x. This is partially due to the reduction  in capex in 2015-2017 following the commissioning of the last jack up rig that  EDC expects at end-2014.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Upgrade to 'BB+': We may consider an upgrade to 'BB+' if: - FFO adjusted net leverage remains below 1.5x and FFO interest cover remains  above 8x on a sustained basis. - The fourth jack-up rig (Mercury) is commissioned without significant delays  and budget overruns; - Positive FCF starting from 2015. - On-shore drilling volumes declining by not more than 15% yoy in 2014, at least  +5% yoy in 2015. Outlook Stabilisation: We may consider revising the Outlook to Stable if:  - FFO adjusted net leverage settles above 1.5x, and FFO interest cover below 8x  on a sustained basis. - On-shore drilling volumes decline by more than 15% yoy in 2014 and do not  rebound in 2015. We may consider a downgrade to 'BB-' if the company's FFO adjusted net leverage  exceeds 2.5x on a sustained basis due to M&A, significantly higher dividends,  weak operational performance or material cost overruns/delays in the Caspian  Sea, which we now assess as unlikely.   DEBT AND LIQUIDITY Comfortable Debt; Sufficient Liquidity At end-2013 EDC had total balance-sheet debt of USD1.11bn. Its short-term debt  of USD104m was well covered by cash and cash equivalents of USD629m. Fitch  believes that EDC will be able to repay its upcoming maturities from its cash  flows from operations.   Manageable FX Risks At end-2013, 77% of EDC's borrowings were US dollar-denominated. We expect that  its net US dollar-denominated operating cashflows from offshore drilling are  sufficient to cover its US dollar-denominated debt servicing, including interest  and principal and hence view EDC's currency mismatch risk as manageable. We view  the Russian rouble depreciation in 1Q14 as neutral for EDC's credit profile,  though it will have a negative impact on its absolute US dollar-denominated  revenue and EBITDA figures in 2014, as the company reports in US dollars.
