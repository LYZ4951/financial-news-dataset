May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The vast majority of nearly 200 delegates who attended  Fitch Ratings' 'Viking Tour' events this month said that sovereign support for  domestic systemically important banks (D-SIFIs) in the Nordic region remained as  likely as before, or at least still highly probable, despite the coming  resolution tools being introduced to deal with failing banks. Over the three events, held in Copenhagen, Helsinki and Stockholm from 7 to 9  May, just 2% to 7% of delegates thought new resolution tools would make  sovereign support less likely for D-SIFIs. The majority of delegates (spanning 48% to 62% over the three events) also said  they expect the Nordic high-yield market to continue growing and that high-yield  bonds would establish themselves as a permanent funding source. Whilst most  believed that Nordic high-yield documentation would converge towards the  international standard, a significant number (from 25% to 43%) also thought that  the Nordic standard would prevail as it is easy to use.  Delegates in Copenhagen were asked their views on the country's new mortgage  bond law, with over two-thirds saying it would address liquidity risk but not  the underlying market structure resulting from a large volume of short-term  mortgage bonds in Denmark. 193 delegates attended our 'Viking Tour' event series this year.
