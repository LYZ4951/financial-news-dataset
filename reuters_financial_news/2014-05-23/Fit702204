May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Bank of England [BKENG.UL] governor Mark Carney's plan to introduce  accountability rules for senior insurance industry executives underlines Fitch  Ratings' view that the UK has stepped up its regulatory focus on the sector,  adding to the risk of further potentially disruptive reform. It is too early to assess the likely impact of accountability rules. They will  probably increase the overall regulatory burden, but there could also be a  negative impact if they deter people from accepting senior insurance roles, or  benefits if they result in closer scrutiny of risk by senior managers. Carney  highlighted the plan in an article for "The Times", in which he also said the  Bank of England "won't hesitate to step in" if it believes management action  could pose a risk. Other recent UK regulatory and legislative changes are more clearly negative for  profitability, particularly among life insurers. We revised the UK life  insurance sector outlook to negative from stable at end-March following the  announcement of three initiatives. These were the scrapping of rules requiring  retirees to buy an annuity, the introduction of a 0.75% cap on charges for  pension auto-enrolment default funds, and a Financial Conduct Authority  investigation into whether insurers are managing business in closed funds in  customers' best interests. The combined effects of these changes will put increased strain on  profitability, which is already a relative weakness for the UK life sector. This  is because insurance companies are competing for business in a highly regulated,  saturated market, while low interest rates are pushing investment returns down.  But we still consider rated UK life insurers' capital positions strong - an  important factor underpinning their credit ratings.
