May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

High-grade financials are now European credit investors'  favourite choice, according to Fitch Ratings' latest quarterly survey.  Investors' top marginal investment choice is high-grade financials with 29% of  votes, nearly double the 15% figure from a year ago. High yield is down to  runner-up with 18% of votes following an unbroken five quarter run.  Some 54% of respondents think spreads for financials will tighten over the next  12 months, the most of all asset classes. This corresponds with investors'  expectation that fundamental credit conditions will improve within this  timeframe. Two-thirds of respondents are optimistic about this.  Fitch's bank rating actions in 1Q14 on standalone credit profiles are consistent  with gradually improving fundamentals, with Viability Rating upgrades  outweighing downgrades in European developed markets. Most of the upgrades were  the result of either improved capitalisation or profitability, whereas the  downgrades largely resulted from asset quality deterioration. In Fitch's view, improved investor sentiment towards banks is positive at a time  when many lenders, particularly those in southern Europe, are taking actions to  strengthen their funding profiles and capital levels. This may make it easier  for banks to access capital markets, raise Basel III-compliant capital  securities and build higher loss-absorbing capital buffers to combat capital  shortfalls that might arise from the ECB's comprehensive assessment this year. Despite their optimism, respondents still see asset quality challenges for  southern European banks. While 47% see broad challenges over a combination of  asset quality, profitability, capital, funding and liquidity, asset quality is  the single highest concern out of these factors, picking up 32% of votes. Fitch believes that asset quality is still the main risk for southern European  banks. Other fundamentals, in terms of capital, funding and liquidity are  improving, although profitability prospects for core banking activities are  still limited.  Investors' focus on asset quality is not surprising as banks have been preparing  for this year's asset quality review and stress test. Many reviewed their  portfolios last year, applying more conservative classifications of impaired  loans than in the past and boosting provisions, often prompted by national  regulators. Fitch's analysis of 108 banks with relevant public data from the  sample of 124 EU banks participating in the EBA's stress test shows that  reported impaired loans increased by an average 8.1% in 2013, with 30 banks  seeing a rise by more than 20%.
