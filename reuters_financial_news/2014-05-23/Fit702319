May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey's (CBRT) decision to cut its main interest rate while leaving other rates unchanged sends a mixed message regarding monetary policy that may dent its credibility, and highlights the risk that policy reversals could undermine economic adjustment, Fitch Ratings says.  The CBRT on Thursday unexpectedly cut its one-week repo rate by 50bp to 9.5%,  while leaving its overnight borrowing and lending rates unchanged at 12% and 8%  respectively. Cutting the main policy rate as inflation continues to head  upwards towards double digits reinforces our judgement that policy coherence and  predictability remain weaker in Turkey than in some of its rating peers, a point  that we highlighted when we affirmed Turkey's 'BBB-' sovereign rating last  month.   Keeping the overnight borrowing rate above the policy rate may support the  Monetary Policy Committee's assertion that "a tight monetary policy stance will  be maintained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation  outlook." But the cut in the one-week repo rate is partly a response to a  recovery in investor appetite for Turkish assets, and a stabilisation in the  Turkish lira, that was in part driven by the CBRT's large rate hikes at the end  of January.  Continued lira strengthening and the approach of presidential elections in  August could set the stage for a further rate cut this summer. Easing via the  repo rate while inflation remains a risk (last month the CBRT revised up its  inflation forecast for end-2014 from 6.6% to 7.6%) could damage the CBRT's  credibility as a policy making institution, which was bolstered by January's  rate increases and accompanied by a commitment to greater transparency in  monetary policy. Inflation rose to a two-year high of 9.4% yoy in April. Tighter monetary policy has started to deliver some economic rebalancing.  Domestic lending growth has slowed to slightly below the CBRT's reference rate  of 15% per annum. Externally, the 12-month rolling current account deficit  narrowed to USD60bn in March, from a peak of USD65bn in December, reflecting  stronger export growth and a modest decline in imports. The CBRT expects net  exports to make a positive contribution to growth this year. Tighter monetary  policy has also contributed to our lower growth forecasts of 2.5% in 2014, and  3.2% in 2015.  But Turkey remains vulnerable to external shocks. 1Q14 balance of payments data  showed that net capital inflows had fallen to close to zero, leaving net errors  and omissions (USD6.6bn) and drawdowns on the international reserves (USD4.9bn)  to fund the current account deficit of USD11.5bn.
