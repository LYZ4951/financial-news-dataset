BRASILIA, May 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank looks set to finally stop raising interest rates next week after taking them to over two-year highs, hoping it has done enough already to keep inflation under control, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.

Forty-eight of 58 economists surveyed by Reuters expect the Brazilian central bank to keep its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> at 11.00 percent at its May 27-28 meeting. Only 10 forecast a 25-point hike, which would be the tenth in a row since April of 2013. Many warned of the risks of such a decision, saying that standing pat with inflation above 6 percent could tarnish the bank's credibility and would just increase the need for steeper rate increases in less than a year. Despite the central bank action, Brazil's inflation has barely slowed from a year ago, hurting business and consumer confidence and threatening President Dilma Rousseff's wide lead in the run-up for national elections in October. "Further rate increases are still necessary, even if they are to happen in small steps of 25 basis points," said Alex Agostini, chief economist at Austin Rating in Sao Paulo. "But the central bank accommodated inflation around this 6 percent level and this seems satisfactory for them, for now." The central bank targets inflation at 4.5 percent, with a tolerance margin of 2 percentage points. Central bank officials have argued that it is too soon to say monetary policy failed to bring inflation back to the 4.5 percent target because it acts with a lag and a large part of its effects on prices are yet to take place.  That line of reasoning has been reiterated in central bank documents and recent speeches, convincing economists that the bank is probably seeking a pause. The outlook for stable interest rates was strengthened this week by signs that a recent spike in food prices has lost steam. Brazil's annual inflation rate <BRCPIY=ECI> is currently at 6.3 percent. [ID:nL2N0NV0JU] But economists say stopping now will only make Brazil's inflation problem worse because its origins remain in place: chief among them are low productivity, hefty public spending and a tight labor market --the only one upon which monetary policy has any effect. "Although we agree that the recent hikes are still likely to feed through the economy, the current inflation outlook is still worrisome," Morgan Stanley's economists led by Gray Newman wrote in a report. As a result, the central bank would need to raise interest rates again early next year, taking them to 12.25 percent by end-2015 according to the median of 50 forecasts in the poll.
