LISBON, May 23 (Reuters) - The troubled holding company Espirito Santo International (ESI) - a key shareholder in Portugal's largest listed bank BES <BES.LS> - plans asset sales and a large capital hike at its subholding Rioforte to repair its finances. [ID:nL6N0O823L]

A spokesman for the Espirito Santo Group conglomerate that owns the Luxembourg-based ESI, told Reuters ESI will seek a capital increase worth an estimated 1 billion euros ($1.37 billion) at Rioforte in the next two or three months. Auditors recently found irregularities at ESI, according to BES.
