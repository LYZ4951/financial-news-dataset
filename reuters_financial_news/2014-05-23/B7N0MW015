BANGKOK, May 23 (Reuters) - Thai stocks fell 2 percent to their lowest in nearly two weeks on Friday, a day after the army chief seized control of the government in a coup.

The SET index <.SETI> was down 2.1 percent at 1,376.67, the lowest since May 12, amid active selling in large cap banks and telecoms stocks, including shares of Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> and Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK>. The benchmark closed up 0.16 percent on Thursday before the military announcement, with foreign outflows continuing for a third straight session after the imposition of martial law on Tuesday.
