PARIS, May 23 (Reuters) - Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said on Friday the European Central Bank's current review of banks' balance sheets would boost confidence in the French bank system.

Speaking as head of the ACPR French financial watchdog, Noyer said French banks and insurers had achieved "satisfactory" results and strengthened their solvability despite a difficult macroeconomic environment.
