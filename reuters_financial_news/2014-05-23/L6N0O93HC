VIENNA, May 23 (Reuters) - Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> wrote down the book value of its Bank Aval unit in Ukraine by 216 million euros ($295 million) in the first quarter given the sharp fall in the hryvnia currency, it said.

That left the book value of the unit at 611 million euros, a spokeswoman said on Friday. The unit's goodwill had already been written off entirely. The move had no impact on the group's equity or consolidated profit-and-loss statement, she added. The writedown was booked in the bank's corporate centre segment in quarterly results released on Thursday that showed group consolidated profit of 161 million euros, easily beating market expectations.
