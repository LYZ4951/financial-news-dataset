May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Deutsche Bank AG's <DBKGn.DE> (A+/Negative/a/F1+) undated non-cumulative fixed to reset rate additional Tier 1 securities of 2014 a final rating of 'BB+'. The rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 2 May 2014.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments with fully discretionary  coupon payments and are subject to a write-down if Deutsche Bank breaches a  5.125% Basel III common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. The trigger ratio is  calculated on a 'phased-in' basis under the EU capital requirement regulations  (CRR).  The notes are offered in three tranches: a EUR1.75bn 6% tranche (ISIN  DE000DB7XHP3), a USD1.25bn 6.25% tranche (ISIN XS1071551474) and a GBP650m  7.125% tranche (ISIN XS1071551391).  The notes are rated five notches below Deutsche Bank's 'a' Viability Rating  (VR), in accordance with Fitch's criteria for "Assessing and Rating Bank  Subordinated and Hybrid Securities". The notes are notched down twice for loss  severity to reflect the write-down on breach of the trigger, and three times for  relative non-performance risk.  The notching for relative non-performance risk reflects the notes' fully  discretionary coupons, which Fitch considers the most easily activated form of  loss absorption.  The issuer will not make an interest payment if the payment, together with  payments made on other Tier 1 instruments, exceeds available distributable items  adjusted for interest expense on Tier 1 instruments, or if the authorities or  legislation prohibit the bank from making payments.  The bank calculates its available distributable items under German GAAP for the  parent bank. The available distributable items include net income and movements  from capital reserves (balance sheet profit) and free capital reserves and  retained earnings. Under the German commercial code, certain amounts related to  intangible assets, deferred tax assets and pension assets cannot be distributed,  reducing the available distributable items. At end-2013, the amount available to  Deutsche Bank for distribution to AT1 holders amounted to about EUR2.7bn. German  accounting standards allow the issuer to influence the amount of distributable  items somewhat (e.g. through dividends upstreamed from subsidiaries), and Fitch  expects the bank to manage its balance sheet profit to ensure that sufficient  amounts are available to make interest payments on the AT1 instruments. The 5.125% trigger is on a phased-in basis, but even on a fully applied basis  the bank has a sizeable buffer above this trigger. The recently announced  capital increase of EUR8bn (see 'Fitch: Capital Increase to Aid Deutsche Bank's  Manoeuvrability') will improve Deutsche Bank's fully applied Basel III CET1  ratio to 11.8% from 9.5% at end-March 2014, providing a sizeable buffer of  around EUR25bn above 5.125%. However, we believe that loss absorption would  occur before a breach of the 5.125% trigger in the form of non-payment of  coupon, which under Fitch's criteria would be considered as non-performance. The  agency expects Deutsche Bank to become subject to capital regulation  restrictions on distributions, including distributions on AT1 instruments, if  and when it breaches its combined buffer requirements.  The announced capital increase will also result in a stronger buffer to a 9%  fully applied CET1 ratio of around EUR10bn. The ratio will face further pressure  in 2014 as new regulations are implemented and due to uncertainty around the  potential impact from ECB's upcoming asset quality review as well as any other  capital requirements potentially to come from European Banking Authority's  stress test. However, Fitch expects Deutsche Bank to maintain sound capital  ratios that provide a sufficient buffer to avoid restrictions on interest  payments on AT1 instruments.  The agency also expects that the bank will manage the amount of available  distributable items, which can be affected by management's decision on dividend  payments from subsidiaries, so that coupon payments will not be prohibited if  sufficient free capital resources are available within the group. Fitch has assigned 50% equity credit to the securities. This reflects their full  coupon flexibility, the permanent nature and the subordination to all senior  creditors.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  As the notes are notched down from Deutsche Bank's VR, their rating is primarily  sensitive to any changes to this rating. Failure to improve underlying earnings  in 2014 would put Deutsche Bank's VR under pressure (for more details on the  main sensitivities see 'Fitch Revises Deutsche Bank's Outlook to Negative on  Support Expectations; Affirms at 'A+'', dated 26 March 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com).
