May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The military takeover of Thailand's government on 22 May is not in itself a negative sovereign ratings trigger, Fitch Ratings says.  The key factor for Thailand's sovereign credit profile is the speed at which the  country can move towards installing an effective, fully-functioning government  without sparking a further escalation in political stability. The coup  underscores the ongoing political uncertainty, while it does not present an  inherent challenge to the establishment of a new process to revert to stable  government.  The political reaction to the coup is a short-term wild card. Broad acquiescence  to a new military (or military-backed) government, followed by a transparent  process towards fresh elections, could ultimately be positive for political and  economic stability.  That said, rejection of the coup by key political groups - leading to more  intense confrontation - would risk further undermining investor and consumer  confidence. If a process for political stabilisation is not in place by early in  H2, then we would expect more lasting damage to the economy from ongoing events  - that could ultimately be negative for Thailand's sovereign credit. Fitch expects to revise down its forecast of 2.5% growth for 2014 on the back of  the ongoing political uncertainty and weak first quarter data showing that the  economy contracted by 0.6% yoy. The government has already cut its growth  forecast to a range of 1.5%-2.5%, from an initial 3%-4%. Thailand's economy is reasonably well-positioned to rebound quickly from short,  negative shocks, and this is a factor in the sovereign's 'BBB+' Long-Term  Foreign Currency IDR. Macroeconomic buffers are sufficiently robust to withstand  stress in the short term, though Thai markets have underperformed their regional  peers since the intensification of instability in November, and experienced an  outflow of capital. Buffers include a substantial net external creditor position  of 35% of GDP, moderate government debt of 32% of GDP, and the track record of  the Bank of Thailand in delivering relatively low and stable inflation.
