May 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Platinum Trust February 2013 Tranche II (Platinum Feb 13 II) and Platinum Trust March 2013 (Platinum Mar 13). The transactions are securitisations of commercial vehicle loans in India originated by Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd <CHLA.NS> (CIFCL).  The rating actions are as follows: Platinum Trust February 2013 Tranche II INR 1,490.6m class A notes due June 2017 affirmed at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable Platinum Trust March 2013 INR 891.0m class A notes due August 2017 affirmed at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect the build-up of credit enhancement (CE) and steady  portfolio performance with stabilising delinquencies and defaults.  The 90+ day delinquency rates for the transactions have fallen since reaching  highs in March 2014. The three-month arrears rate was last reported at 3.34% and  1.45% as of April 2014, as a percentage of the original pool balance,  respectively for the Platinum Feb 13 II and Platinum Mar 13 transactions. The  delinquencies have yet to materialise into substantial losses as each  transaction's respective first loss credit facility (FLCF) has yet to be drawn  since closing. The loss facilities in the form of fixed deposits continue to  provide an increasing percentage of credit support as the transactions pay down.  The fixed deposits are 19.3% and 18.7% of the Platinum Feb 13 II and Platinum  Mar 13 transactions respectively.. In 2014, delinquencies are generally expected to increase for Fitch-rated  asset-backed securitisation (ABS) transactions in India. This is due to India's  economic slowdown, which has been exacerbated by the recent depreciation of the  Indian rupee, rising fuel prices, and political uncertainty. However, the  continued amortisation of the underlying portfolios will create a buffer for the  two Platinum transactions against India's economic uncertainties.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
