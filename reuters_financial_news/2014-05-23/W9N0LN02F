WELLINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in May, a survey showed on Friday, with consumers more cautious as the central bank raised rates to contain inflation in a strongly growing economy.

The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index was 127.6 from 133.5 in April. It hit a seven-year high of 135.8 in January. A reading above 100 shows optimism, while below 100 indicates pessimism. The survey showed consumers were less optimistic about their own financial positions, as well as the near- and longer-term economic outlooks.
