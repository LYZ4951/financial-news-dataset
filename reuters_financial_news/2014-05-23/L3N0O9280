HANOI, May 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> was almost unchanged on Friday, closing down 0.04 percent in low trading volume as the market lacked news, analysts said.

Volume on Friday fell 34 percent from a day earlier to 86 million shares, Reuters data showed. Buying demand was just enough to cover profit taking by cautious investors, said analyst Tran Hai Yen of Bao Viet Securities. With no negative news expected next week, the index is likely to hover around the current level, analysts said. Vietnam's biggest listed bank by capitalisation Vietcombank <VCB.HM> fell 2.59 percent, while the country's largest listed company PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM> edged up 0.54 percent.
