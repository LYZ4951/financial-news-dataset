HONG KONG, May 23 (Reuters) - China shares rose on Friday on the back of property stocks, which were lifted by further signs of relaxation from housing authorities.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.7 percent at 2,034.57 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings gained 0.8 percent. Friday's gains erased losses earlier this week. The CSI300 inched up 0.1 percent this week, while the Shanghai benchmark gained 0.4 percent. The CSI property sub-index <.CSICMREI> rose 2.6 percent on Friday after a Shanghai Securities News report cited a central government official as saying more cities would ease their housing-purchase restrictions.
