SHANGHAI, May 23 (Reuters) - China's money rates rose this week under moderate pressure from upcoming tax payments, but a large injection from the central bank during open market operations -- and rumours of a large re-lending facility granted to the China Development bank -- kept a lid on the rise.

The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.38 percent on Friday, up 17 basis points from last week's close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> rose a moderate 28 basis points to 2.53 percent, while the 14-day repo CN14DRP=CFXS jumped 80 basis points to 3.89 percent.  "The money rate rose at the beginning of this week, but after the central bank injected money via open market operations, the money rates gradually fall back, which also showed its intention of keeping money loose," said a dealer at an Asian bank in Shanghai. The People's Bank of China injected a net 120 billion yuan ($19.25 billion) through ordinary open market operations this week, its largest weekly injection since January. Sources told Reuters that it had also issued 300 billion yuan in relending loans to the China Development Bank [CHDB.UL] for use in refurbishing shantytown housing, which is considered akin to a money base injection. [ID:nL3N0O82IR] Economists and traders now agree that the central bank is turning from a neutral policy to an easier one as slow economic growth has continued into the second quarter. But how far it will go remains debated, with some calling for a cut in reserve requirement ratios at banks as early as the second quarter, while others expect the PBOC to continue to prefer more targeted tools. The benchmark five-year interest rate swap <CNYQB7R5Y=> stood at 3.98 percent by midday on Friday.
