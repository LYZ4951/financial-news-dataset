ALMATY, May 23 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development signed up on Friday to a multi-billion-dollar funding deal with Kazakhstan that will tap the country's vast oil fund to bolster reforms intended to diversify its economy.

The Kazakh government will provide $2.7 billion towards the programme, which the ERBD [EBRD.UL] said it and other international lenders would channel into key economic sectors, "co-financing projects that may not be otherwise possible". Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 73-year-old former steelworker who has ruled the country for more than two decades, ordered his government in February to raid the strategic National Fund, which is replenished with windfall oil export revenues, and channel $1 trillion tenge ($5.5 billion) to the economy to help keep growth at 6-7 percent in the coming years. Kazakhstan, a vast steppe nation of 17 million which lies in Central Asia, is the second largest post-Soviet oil producer after Russia.  Nazarbayev has repeatedly said that the country needs to diversify its economy to be less vulnerable to changes in world prices for its crude and other commodities - a stance supported by international financial institutions. "We have been looking for ways to increase our investment in the country, and the new partnership will enable us to be more involved... dramatically increasing our own investment," EBRD director for Kazakhstan, Janet Heckman, said in a statement. The EBRD gave no figure for its potential new investment, but a spokeswoman said: "Last year the bank invested some $550 million in Kazakhstan, and now this figure can be much bigger."  The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with which Kazakhstan signed agreements earlier this month, are also participating in the co-financing programme. It will be managed by a coordination council including representatives of the three banks. The Kazakh government has defined priority areas for reforms, including financial sector, small and medium-sized enterprises, innovation, regional development and institutional reforms, the EBRD said. It said it expects Kazakhstan's economy to grow by about 5 percent this year and next, adding that reforms can increase GDP growth by as much as 1.5 percent in the long term.
