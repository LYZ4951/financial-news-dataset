PARIS, May 23 (Reuters) - Bank of France head Christian Noyer said on Friday that he was closely monitoring risks related to a U.S. probe of French bank BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> over alleged dealings with countries subject to sanctions.

France's biggest bank warned last month it faced fines in excess of $1.1 billion over the matter, but declined to provide a specific number. U.S. authorities are seeking a settlement of more than $5 billion, according to media reports.
