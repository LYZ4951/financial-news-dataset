PARIS, April 29 (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said on Tuesday he had asked France's AMF financial watchdog to ensure that the process surrounding any transaction involving power and transport group Alstom <ALSO.PA> is transparent.

Montebourg said he had asked the AMF to instruct Alstom's board to give strictly equal treatment to offers from Siemens <SIEGn.DE> and General Electric <GE.N> in order to encourage a "fair and constructive" debate on a possible takeover.
