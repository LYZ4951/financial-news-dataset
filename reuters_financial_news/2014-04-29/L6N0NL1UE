LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Credit reporting company Experian <EXPN.L> said on Tuesday it had appointed an executive from inspection and product testing company Intertek <ITRK.L> as its chief financial officer (CFO), after promoting former CFO Brian Cassin to chief executive in January.

The firm, which allows companies to check the credit ratings of their customers - and also enables people to make online evaluations of their own credit rating - said Intertek CFO Lloyd Pitchford would join in September this year.
