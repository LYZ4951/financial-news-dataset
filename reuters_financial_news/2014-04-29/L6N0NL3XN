MADRID, April 29 (Reuters) - Leading Spanish bank Santander will look at acquiring government owned Catalunya Banc when it comes up for auction, Santander Chief Executive Javier Marin said at a news conference on Tuesday.

"We're interested in looking at it and it's important to get this over with as soon as possible," Marin said, referring to the conclusion of the government clean-up of failed savings banks. The government is expected to sell off Catalunya Banc later this year after failing to do so last year when bidders asked for government guarantees that losses would not be excessive.
