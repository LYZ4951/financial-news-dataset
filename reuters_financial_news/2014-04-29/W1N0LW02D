WASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee does not plan to hold any votes on Tuesday on a draft measure to wind down government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB>, according to a Senate aide.

Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a Democrat, and Senator Mike Crapo, the panel's top Republican, are pushing back the schedule for the vote to build more support for the housing finance reform bill, the aide said.
