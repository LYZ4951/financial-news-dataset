BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, approved on Tuesday the acquisition of Britain's MetLife Assurance Limited by another British firm Rothesay Life Limited.

"The Commission concluded that the transaction would not raise any competition concerns, in particular because the merged entity will continue to face strong competition after the merger," the Commission said in a statement.
