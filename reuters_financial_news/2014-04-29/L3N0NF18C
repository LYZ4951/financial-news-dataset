SINGAPORE, April 30 (Reuters) - Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp <OCBC.SI> said first-quarter quarterly profit jumped 29 percent to a record, boosted by strong loans and a widening of its net interest margin, beating expectations.    Bigger rival DBS Group Holdings <DBSM.SI> also posted record profit with both banks seeing double-digit loan growth despite a slowdown in the housing market.

OCBC earned a record S$899 million ($716 million) in net profit for the quarter, up from S$696 million in the same period a year earlier, and above an average forecast of S$727 million from four analysts. "The momentum across our customer franchise is strong and sustaining," OCBC CEO Samuel Tsien said in a statement.
