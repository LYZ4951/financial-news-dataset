SYDNEY, April 29 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell on Tuesday, pulling back from near six-year highs, as investors took profits after several investment firms downgraded their outlook for banks.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> fell 0.9 percent to 5,487.1 by 0515 GMT, looking set to break seven consecutive sessions of gains. The benchmark had earlier touched a fresh near 6-year high of 5,554.5 before sliding to session lows of 5,469.3.  In a research note to clients Citigroup lowered Westpac Banking Corp and National Australia Bank's ratings to 'neutral' and 'sell' respectively. Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley retained its "underweight" rating on NAB while local media reported Bell Director Charlie Aitken had downgraded his recommendation on all four 'Big Banks'.  "Morgan Stanley and Citi have changed their outlook particularly on NAB, both of them are fairly negative, expecting some disappointments to come through in their results next Thursday," said Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG. Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> lost 1.2 percent, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> dropped 0.9 percent. Australia New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> shed 1 percent and National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> lost 1.6 percent.
