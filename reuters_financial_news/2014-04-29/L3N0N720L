HONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - China's Bank of Communications Co Ltd <601328.SS> <3328.HK>, the country's fifth-largest listed bank, posted a 5 percent increase in first-quarter net profits, missing estimates, as net interest margins fell.

Net profit for the quarter rose to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.99 billion) from 17.706 billion yuan in the same 2013 period, the bank said in its unaudited financial statement. That compares with an average estimate of 19.20 billion yuan calculated from a Thomson Reuters poll of six analysts. First quarter net interest margin fell to 2.33 percent compared with 2.52 percent at the end of December.
