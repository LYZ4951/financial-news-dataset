FRANKFURT, April 29 (Reuters) - Euro zone banks are already in better shape than they were last year before the European Central Bank launched its unprecedented review of their balance sheets, ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio told Reuters Insider on Tuesday.

Constancio said the total measures that banks had taken since July last year to strengthen their balance sheets amounted to 104 billion euros ($143.98 billion), for example through planned or already completed capital hikes or increases in provisions. "In a way one could say that the comprehensive assessment in that respect is already a success," he said.  Constancio's comments came as the European Banking Authority (EBA) unveiled details for an EU-wide banking stress test, which is part of a broader review the ECB is conducting before it becomes supervisor of euro zone lenders in November. [ID:nL6N0NL4M7] The full assessment will be concluded in October. Asked whether the ECB would hold off with any plan for large-scale asset purchases until the review was done, Constancio said "there is no relation between the two things".
