DUBAI, April 29 (Reuters) - Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>, Dubai's largest lender, is set to price a five-year bond worth at least A$200 million ($185.3 million) on Wednesday, a document from lead managers said.

The transaction, earmarked to price at 225 basis points over asset swaps, is being arranged by ANZ <ANZ.AX>, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> and HSBC <HSBA.L> as well as ENBD's own investment banking arm. ENBD joins other banks from the United Arab Emirates that have issued bonds denominated in Australian dollars in recent weeks - National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> and First Gulf Bank <FGB.AD> issued five-year deals worth A$400 million and A$250 million respectively in March.
