April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says the restructuring of the last six  partially supported transactions under Scaldis Capital programme (Scaldis) to  full support will not affect the 'F1sf' Short-term rating on the programme's  asset-backed commercial paper (CP). As a result of this change, all transactions under the Scaldis programme are  fully supported through liquidity loan agreements with BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV  (BNPP Fortis, A+/Stable/F1) as liquidity provider. CP investors are not exposed  to the credit risk of the underlying transactions, but are dependent on the  liquidity support from BNPP Fortis. Fitch had previously commented in September 2013 there was no impact on Scaldis'  CP rating following the restructuring of the programme that was completed in  December 2013 (see "Fitch: No Impact on Scaldis' ABCP Rating From Programme  Restructuring" dated 20 September 2013 and available at www.fitchratings.com). The previous 2013 restructuring streamlined the Scaldis programme structure and  added provisions for the issuance of CP with callable, puttable and extendible  features. This latest change aims to exempt the Scaldis programme from the  covered fund definition under Section 619 (also known as the Volcker Rule) of  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)  which must be complied with starting on 21 July 2015. If Scaldis were considered  a covered fund, BNPP Fortis (as a banking entity regulated by the Dodd-Frank  Act) would be prohibited from sponsoring, investing in or transacting with  Scaldis. Although Scaldis' programme level documentation still allows for the addition of  partially supported transactions, Fitch believes this is unlikely as inclusion  of such transactions would cause BNPP Fortis to be non-compliant with the  Volcker Rule.
