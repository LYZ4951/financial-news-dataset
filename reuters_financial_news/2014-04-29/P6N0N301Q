PARIS, April 29 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trading on Tuesday, with telecom gear maker Nokia <NOK1V.HE> surging 5.5 percent after unveiling plans to return $3.1 billion to shareholders via buybacks and extra dividends.

Shares in Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> also gained ground, up 2 percent after Germany's biggest lender said its pretax profit fell by nearly a third in the first quarter, although the drag on earnings was not as bad as that seen by some of its rivals. [ID:nL6N0NL1WQ]
