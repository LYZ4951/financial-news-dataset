MOSCOW, April 29 (Reuters) - Russian food retailer O'Key <OKEYq.L> said on Tuesday it swung to a first-quarter net loss from a year-ago profit due to foreign exchange losses and a tax charge related to the payment of dividends.

The company made a net loss of 22.2 million roubles ($618,200) compared with a 144.5 million rouble profit the year earlier, it said in a statement.
