SIENA, Italy, April 29 (Reuters) - Italy's third biggest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>, needs to be able to pay back cheap funds it borrowed from the European Central Bank on schedule and without hurting the lender's liquidity, its CEO said on Tuesday.

"The liquidity situation has improved a lot but there is still a lot of work to do. We need to create the conditions to pay back the LTRO fully respecting the deadline," CEO Fabrizio Viola told a shareholder meeting.
