LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro on Tuesday after first-quarter UK gross domestic product growth data fell slightly short of expectations.    Gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter, picking up a bit of speed from growth of 0.7 percent in the last three months of 2013, the Office for National Statistics said. For the year, economic output rose 3.1 percent.

A Reuters poll, however, had forecast stronger quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.9 percent and 3.2 percent in yearly terms. <ECONGB> Sterling fell to a day's low of $1.6792 <GBP=D4> after the data from around $1.6839 beforehand. The currency had hit a 4 1/2 year high of $1.6858 on Monday. The euro rose 0.1 percent trade at 82.55 pence <EURGBP=D4> after the data, from 82.335 beforehand.
