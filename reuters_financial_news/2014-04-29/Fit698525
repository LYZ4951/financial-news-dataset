April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed four tranches of TDA 29,  FTA, a Spanish prime RMBS transaction comprising loans originated and serviced  by Banca March [BNCMH.UL] and Banco de Sabadell <SABE.MC> .  A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Cumulative Defaults on the Rise Performance of the collateral has deteriorated sharply over the past 12 months  with gross cumulative defaults rising to 3.9% of the initial collateral balance  from 2.87%. This level of defaults, however, is still below the average (4.34%)  for other Fitch-rated Spanish RMBS. The weaker asset performance has prevented  class A notes from gaining additional credit enhancement through deleveraging,  while reducing the class B and C credit enhancement.Nevertheless, available and projected levels of credit enhancement are  sufficient to withstand the credit losses at their rating levels.   Principal Deficiency to Increase Fitch expects the balance of un-provisioned defaults to increase over the next  12 months as late stage arrears migrate into defaults and also due to likely low  recoveries on the cumulative defaults amid a weak Spanish residential property  market. The agency notes that recovery cash flows obtained to date have not been  from the sale of repossessed properties. These factors underline the Negative  Outlooks on the class A and B notes and the 0% recovery estimate on the class C  and D notes. The transaction's structure allows for the full provisioning of defaulted loans,  which are defined as loans in arrears for more than 12 months. Because gross  excess spread (0.54% per annum as of the latest payment date) and recoveries on  defaulted loans have been insufficient to fully cover period defaults, the  reserve fund has been depleted for over a year, and the balance of  un-provisioned defaults has accumulated to 0.77% of the current note balance.   Payment Interruption and Commingling Risks Fitch believes the transaction is exposed to payment interruption and  commingling risks in the event of a servicer disruption. Under a servicer  default scenario, Fitch views the liquidity available in the transaction as  insufficient to fully cover senior fees, net swap payments and senior note  interest due amounts for at least one or two interest payment dates, and  additionally commingling losses could be crystallised because collection banks  (Banca March and Banco de Sabadell) retain those monies for one week before  transferring them to the SPV bank account banks, Barclays Bank plc [BARCR.UL] (A/Stable/F1)  and BNP Paribas (A+/Stable/F1) Spanish branches.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Deterioration in asset performance may result from economic factors, in  particular the increasing effects of unemployment. An increase in new defaults  and associated pressure on excess spread levels and reserve funds beyond Fitch's  expectations could result in negative rating actions.  The rating actions are as follows:   TDA 29, FTA Class A2 (ES0377931011) affirmed at 'BBBsf' ; Outlook Negative Class B (ES0377931029) affirmed at 'Bsf'; Outlook Negative Class C (ES0377931037) affirmed at 'CCCsf'; Recovery Estimate 0%
