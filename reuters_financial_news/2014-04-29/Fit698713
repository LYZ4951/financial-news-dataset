April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The acquisition of AstraZeneca Plc <AZN.L> (AZ) would achieve  Pfizer, Inc.'s <PFE.N> strategic aims as the deal promises significant benefits for  the  combined entity, according to Fitch Ratings. The transaction would amass scale  for Pfizer, broaden the company's portfolio and pipeline and could provide some  tax advantages. Pfizer, which is headquartered in New York, Monday confirmed it had approached  London-based AZ in January 2014 regarding a possible merger, and again this  month. AZ confirmed discussions with Pfizer but said there was no specific offer  to acquire the company. Pfizer contends a completed transaction would combine  highly complementary innovative and established pharmaceutical businesses,  enhancing its ability to meet patients' needs. Pfizer's interest in AZ represents a possible return to mega-deals not seen  since the last decade. Recent consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry has  been more targeted in nature. An AZ buy would broaden Pfizer's portfolio and  pipeline, just as when the company acquired Wyeth in October of 2009. The AZ  acquisition would cost Pfizer approximately $99 billion (compared to $68 billion  for Wyeth), and underscores Pfizer's experience with larger acquisitions. Pfizer's January proposal to the board of AZ included a combination of cash and  shares in the combined entity which represented an indicative value of $76.62  per AZ share and a premium of approximately 30%. Pfizer said in a statement that  it is considering its options with respect to AZ. Importantly, a company of Pfizer's size with approximately $70 billion of cash  tied up abroad would likely consider acquisition alternatives that are  accompanied by some sort of tax advantage. A completed Pfizer/AZ transaction  would likely result in a new U.K.-incorporated holding company, according to  Pfizer, and would translate to a lower tax rate than in the US. An AZ acquisition would likely have a negative to neutral effect on Pfizer's  credit profile. However, the potential impact remains unclear until more  specific transaction details become available. Fitch affirmed Pfizer's Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' on April 4. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
