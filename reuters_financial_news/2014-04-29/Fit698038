April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Germany-based HSE Netz AG's [HESUDH.UL] (HSE Netz) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-' with a Stable Outlook  and its senior unsecured rating at 'BBB'. The ratings reflect the low business risk of HSE Netz's network assets and the  early stage of development of German incentive-based regulation. The ratings  also reflect target leverage of between 6x and 7x on a funds from operations  (FFO) adjusted net basis and structural enhancements of the financing structure,  including a debt service reserve account.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Forecast Financials in Line with Ratings Under the Fitch rating case, we expect FFO adjusted net leverage to increase to  above 6x and FFO interest cover to decline to 2.4x-2.5x in the medium term.  These metrics remain within Fitch's ratio guidelines for the 'BBB-' IDR of below  7x FFO adjusted net leverage and above 2.25x FFO interest cover.  Profit-and-Loss Transfer Agreement In 2013 HSE Netz entered into a profit-and-loss transfer agreement with its  parent to optimise the tax position of the group. At the same time, this  agreement provides for a termination without notice in case the bond provisions  are infringed. As a result, HSE Netz continues to be required to fund the  day-to-day operations of the regulated business, maintain a debt service reserve  of EUR16.5m and retain monthly instalments for the bond coupon, before being  able to pay any dividends. Residual cash flow available for distribution as stipulated by the bond  provisions is the limiting factor for dividends, not net income. This  sufficiently ring-fences the operating company from the parent, which is judged  to have weaker credit quality than HSE Netz at this point in time.  Formalistic Approach of the German Regulator Given the Federal Network Agency's formalistic approach of applying provisions  of laws, ordinances and regulations, some legal structures of network businesses  do not allow for all required assets to be captured in filings for the  tariff-setting process. As a result, some assets may not be remunerated. Also,  costs that are not incurred in the year of the cost audit (for example due to  timing of expenditure) are mostly not recognised by the regulator, among them  actual debt costs. Overall, it appears that management teams are required to spend too much time on  the regulatory process to navigate rules that are not in line with the spirit of  what regulation is trying to achieve. A little more substance over form and  economic reasoning by the regulator would clearly be positive for the regulatory  framework in Germany.Group Re-Organisation HSE Netz is considering options to change the legal structure of its regulated  network activities. Currently HSE Netz is the asset owner, Verteilnetzbetreiber  (VNB) Rhein-Main-NeckarGmbH & Co. KG is the asset operator and some work streams  are carried out by service providers, such as the execution of the capital  expenditure programme. The group is exploring all options to improve the  efficiency of its operational practices and remove redundant tasks. The company's ultimate target is to implement cost reductions prescribed for the  second regulatory period (efficiency score of 86.4% for gas and 91.7% expected  for electricity) and to reduce the complexity of future regulatory filings.  Fitch will assess potential changes to the group structure as and when details  become available. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - FFO adjusted net leverage increasing above 7x or FFO net interest cover  falling below 2.25x. - Changes to the regulatory framework leading to an increase in business risk. - Difficulties in meeting the efficiency targets embedded into price limits. Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: - A stronger business profile, alongside positive developments of German network  regulation. In particular, a regulatory approach founded on sound economic  principles aimed at balancing both consumer and investor interests, and  improvements in transparency and predictability would lead Fitch to take a more  favourable view on German regulation. - FFO adjusted net leverage falling below 6x on a sustained basis and FFO net  interest cover comfortably above 2.5x.
