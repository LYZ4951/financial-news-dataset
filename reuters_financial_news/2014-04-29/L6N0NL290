LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, led by tech shares as estimate-topping results from chipmaker Infineon <IFXGn.DE> and telecommunication gear maker Nokia <NOK1V.HE> brightened the outlook for the sector.

Infineon and Nokia were among the top risers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> after they reported quarterly earnings boosted respectively by demand from automotive and industrial customers and by software deals. [ID:nL6N0NL1F2] [ID:nL6N0NL0SL] The strong numbers helped improve market sentiment around the tech sector, which had been dented by weak updates from ASML <ASML.AS>, Ericsson <ERICb.ST> and SAP <SAPG.DE> earlier this month. The STOXX Europe 600 Tech index <.SX8P> was up 1.7 percent at 0741 GMT, outpacing all other sector indexes. Upbeat results by heavyweights such as Norwegian oil & gas group Statoil <STL.OL> and Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> also boosted the broader market. [ID:nWEB00M7H] [ID:nL6N0NL1WQ] They more than outweighed disappointing figures from Swiss engineering group ABB <ABBN.VX>, which posted an unexpected fall in first-quarter profit because of weak power system orders, and from Swedish hygiene and paper products maker SCA <SCAb.ST>, whose earnings rose slightly less than expected. [ID:nL6N0NL0V1][ID:nL6N0NL1MQ] "We haven't had any nasty surprises in earnings so far, which is good news for the market, although we're still far from a genuine rebound in profits that everyone is hoping for this year," a Paris-based trader said. Overall, Europe's earnings season has been mixed so far, StarMine data showed. About 22 percent of companies listed on the STOXX Europe 600 index <.STOXX> reported quarterly results through April 28, with 55 percent having beaten or met analysts' expectations. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, was 0.6 percent higher at 1,344.57 points. The euro zone Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> was also up 0.6 percent, at 3,183.88 points. Tensions between western powers and Russia over Ukraine kept traders on edge, with investors fearing further, costly cross-sanctions after those imposed by the United States on several Russian individuals and companies on Monday. European indexes have struggled to make much headway since hitting multi-year highs earlier this month but charts on the Euro STOXX 50 showed the index was likely to surge after this period of lull, according to Philippe Delabarre, a technical analyst at Trading Central. He highlighted a symmetrical triangle on the index, a pattern formed by two converging lines which connect a series of sequentially lower peaks and higher troughs. Once the price breaches one of these lines, a sharp movement often follows. "We still believe the symmetrical triangle, a bullish continuation pattern, is the main pattern to trade," Delabarre said. "Therefore, as long as triangle's basis at 2,970 is a support threshold, our target is 3,440, corresponding to the overlap between the March 2008 low and August 2008 high."
