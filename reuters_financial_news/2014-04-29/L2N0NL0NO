April 29 (Reuters) - One important indicator traders are watching is the performance of the Russell 2000 <.TOY>, namely whether the leading small-cap index closes below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 2012.

The Russell closed at 1117.06 on Monday, just above the 200-day moving average of 1,111.85, which is considered a good measure of the long term strength of the market. Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group of Harrison, New York noted that it's now 358 days since the Russell closed below its 200-day, the longest streak since 1996.  If small-caps fall today, that 200-day moving average streak is in jeopardy. Premarket trading in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF <IWM.P> so far shows a slight dip to $111.60 from Monday's close of $111.96, and investors of late have been selling these names - like Buffalo Wild Wings <BWLD.O> or Synageva Biopharma <GEVA.O> - en masse. Large-cap stocks have asserted strong leadership in the last couple of months with investors rotating to traditional defensive sectors like utilities and telecommunications, as well as established tech giants like Microsoft, one of the Dow's best performers on the year.  When the Russell falls after long streaks of staying above that 200-day moving average, performance over the next several months suffers. The declines in small-caps are a worry to some because those stocks tend to lead during periods of economic expansion and they've generally outdone the large-caps for the better part of two decades. Bespoke pointed out Monday that the market's current mindset seems to be to retreat to safety, even if price-to-earnings ratios in sectors like utilities are higher than usual.  "Our thesis is that the rotation is hunting stability, and that traders are willing to bid up predictable long term cash flows," they wrote late Monday.   From earlier in the day: 09:01 -  Sprint <S.N> is topping the premarket volume movers among S&P 500 components, with a better-than 3 percent gain following results that included revenue that matched analysts' forecasts [ID:nL2N0NL0GC]. More than 1.7 million shares have crossed before the bell. Merck <MRK.N> has given back a good chunk of its earlier gain, now up just 1 percent after its earnings vs more than 4 percent an hour or so ago. Coach <COH.N> is getting clobbered and it's gotten worse in the last hour after its North American comp-store sales fell 21 percent. It was last down more than 7 percent.

On the wider market, index futures' gains are holding, with the S&P e-minis <ESc1> now up 6 points vs 5.5 earlier.   08:33 - Tuesday's economic data calendar is once again light and for the second straight day housing is front and center <ECONUSTODAY>. Monday's data on the rebound in pending home sales volume offered hope that this winter's swoon in housing activity was largely a result of lousy weather. It did little to help housing-related stocks, though, with the $2 billion SPDR S&P Home Builder ETF <XHB.P> fading an early rally to close fractionally lower. The data this morning, the S&P/CaseShiller indexes <USSHPQ=ECI>, is all about prices and whether the pace of home value appreciation cooled off for a third straight month in February. The Reuters poll sees prices rising 13 percent from a year ago vs 13.2 percent in January. Year-over-year price gains peaked in November at 13.7 percent. Consumer confidence for April from the Conference Board <USCONC=ECI> is also on tap, with an expectation for that to tick up from the March reading, which was the strongest since the eve of the financial crisis back in January 2008. Ahead of the opening bell, the XHB is up 7 cents at $31.06 vs Monday's close of $30.99 on volume of 940 shares.  08:06 - U.S. index futures are all higher Tuesday morning, trending up with other global equities and on optimism about the tenor of the morning's corporate earnings. * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 5.5 points, about 0.30 percent, with just over 130,000 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100s <NDc1> are up 13.75 points, or 0.38 percent, on volume of 22 contracts. * The Dow industrials <DJc1> are up 42 points, or around 0.25 percent, with 55 contracts traded. * Outside of U.S. markets, the MSCI World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> is about a quarter of a percent higher and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index <.MSCIEF> is up by more than half a percent.
