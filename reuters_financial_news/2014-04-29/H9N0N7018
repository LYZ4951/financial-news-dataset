HONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing <0388.HK> said on Tuesday quotas for a cross-border stock investment scheme between Shanghai and Hong Kong may be increased.

The bourse also said funds involved in the recently announced scheme will be restricted within an investment channel to control risks. Regulators in China and Hong Kong surprised market participants earlier this month by unveiling the cross-border scheme, banking on the success of the promotion of the internationalisation of the Chinese currency since 2010.
