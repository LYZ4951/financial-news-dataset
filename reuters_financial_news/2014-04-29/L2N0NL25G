NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - First Horizon National Corp <FHN.N> will pay $110 million to resolve claims it misled Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> into buying mortgage-backed securities that later went sour, a U.S. regulator said on Tuesday.

The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed in New York federal court by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the conservator since 2008 for the government-controlled mortgage companies. FHFA said in a statement that First Horizon will pay $61.6 million to Fannie Mae and $48.4 million to Freddie Mac. The deal marked the 12th settlement the FHFA has reached in litigation the agency began in 2011 with 18 lawsuits over about $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, an investment product at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.
