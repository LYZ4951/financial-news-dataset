LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc <BARC.L> said Skip McGee has quit as head of its U.S. business because he does not want to oversee the task of establishing a new company required under tougher U.S. rules.

Barclays has to establish an intermediate holding company by July 2016, which imposes more stringent rules on the U.S. arms of foreign banks. The bank said given the amount of time and focus on regulations, compliance and legal and operational issues for the next two years McGee had decided to step down.
