BEIRUT, April 29 (Reuters) - Lebanon's Blom Bank <BLOM.BY> reported first-quarter net profit of $87.5 million on Tuesday, up just 0.46 percent on the same period last year.

Blom said the flat profits came amid "unstable economic and political conditions" in Lebanon, which has suffered from the impact of civil war in neighbouring Syria.
