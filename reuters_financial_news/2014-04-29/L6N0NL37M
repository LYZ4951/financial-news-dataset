BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved restructuring aid for Greece's third-largest lender Eurobank <eurbr.at>, the European Union executive said on Tuesday.

"The plan will enable the bank to become viable in the long term without unduly distorting competition," the Commission said in a statement.  "Greece has committed to a comprehensive set of measures covering both the restructuring of Eurobank's activities and the credit policy of the group," it said.
