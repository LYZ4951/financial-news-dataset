DUBLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - An Irish judge said on Tuesday he would not jail two former senior executives at Anglo Irish Bank who were convicted on charges of illegal lending and providing unlawful assistance to investors.

Former finance director Willie McAteer and the bank's head of Irish lending, Pat Whelan, are not deserving of prison sentences because they were given inaccurate advice by Ireland's financial regulator that had led them into law-breaking, Judge Martin Nolan told Dublin's Circuit Criminal Court.
