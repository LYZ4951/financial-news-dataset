April 29 (Reuters) - Target Corp <TGT.N> on Tuesday said it has appointed a new Chief Information Officer, Bob DeRodes, to oversee the discount retailer's technology team, operations and data security enhancements.

Target's previous CIO resigned in March, several months after a massive data breach late last year that led to the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records and 70 million other records of customer details. [ID:nL1N0M218D]
