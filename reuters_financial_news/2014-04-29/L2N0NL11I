April 29 (Reuters) - The big hitter on the earnings front after the bell on Tuesday is Twitter <TWTR.N>, and from the options action it looks like the expectation is for a move in the stock of around 14 percent, up or down, after the numbers hit.

That would be a tad more muted than the 16 percent plunge Twitter suffered following its first-ever quarterly report back in February. The implied volatility (IV) levels are a bit higher now than they were in the run up to February's release. With Monday's close, the 30-day at-the-money (ATM) call IV was quoted at 81.5 percent while the comparable puts were higher at 88.6 percent. In the late afternoon on Tuesday, Twitter shares are up about 2.3 percent at $41.69. Still, the stock has languished. It's now 7 percent below its opening-day close of $44.90 and down 37 percent from where it was the day before it reported anemic user growth in February.From earlier in the day: 10:48 - Utilities are giving back Monday's gains just a touch here on Tuesday, but it's been another great start to the year for one of the most defensive sectors. The S&P Utilities Total Return Index <.TRGSPU> is up more than 15 percent in 2014, best of the 10 industry sectors this year. Investors have retreated to these names thanks to high dividends and predictable cash flow as they've sold the biotechnology and Internet retail names. Exelon Corp <EXC.N> has gained more than 33 percent so far this year, and followed by Public Service Enterprise <PEG.N>, up 26.8 percent. In a note Tuesday, analysts at Credit Suisse try to assuage worries from investors concerned that utilities, especially integrated names like Exelon, will repeat 2013, when they came out of the gate fast only to fade later in the year.  They say rising power prices, expected support for natural gas prices and better trends in earnings estimates should help bolster shares in 2014. The utility sector was down 0.22 percent in morning trading. Index snapshot: * The Dow industrials <.DJI> up 0.5 pct * S&P 500 <.SPX> up 0.4 pct * Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> up 0.5 pct  10:07 - One of the day's early losers is Coach Inc <COH.N>, which is seeing its shares tank on heavy volume after disappointing earnings, particularly when compared with its peers in the normally robust luxury retail category.  The stock is down 9.4 percent to $46.18 a share with more than 7.3 million shares trading hands, already double the average volume over the past 50 days of trading. In its press release the company noted weakness in sales in part because it has cut back on "third party events" like flash sales - surprise one-day sales events where people are usually notified through mobile devices. Overall, North American same-store sales fell 21 percent from a year ago and the go-forward numbers don't look much better as it is losing market shares to Michael Kors Holdings <KORS.N>, Kate Spade <KATE.N> and others.  On a morning conference call the company CFO said it expects this quarter's same-store sales in North America to fall by a similar amount. The company's operating margins took a big hit - falling to 23.9 percent in this quarter from 29.3 percent a year ago.  09:25 -  One important indicator traders are watching is the performance of the Russell 2000 <.TOY>, namely whether the leading small-cap index closes below its 200-day moving average for the first time since November 2012.  The Russell closed at 1117.06 on Monday, just above the 200-day moving average of 1,111.85, which is considered a good measure of the long term strength of the market. Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group of Harrison, New York noted that it's now 358 days since the Russell closed below its 200-day, the longest streak since 1996.  If small-caps fall today, that 200-day moving average streak is in jeopardy. Premarket trading in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF <IWM.P> so far shows a slight dip to $111.60 from Monday's close of $111.96, and investors of late have been selling these names - like Buffalo Wild Wings <BWLD.O> or Synageva Biopharma <GEVA.O> - en masse. Large-cap stocks have asserted strong leadership in the last couple of months with investors rotating to traditional defensive sectors like utilities and telecommunications, as well as established tech giants like Microsoft, one of the Dow's best performers on the year.  When the Russell falls after long streaks of staying above that 200-day moving average, performance over the next several months suffers. The declines in small-caps are a worry to some because those stocks tend to lead during periods of economic expansion and they've generally outdone the large-caps for the better part of two decades. Bespoke pointed out Monday that the market's current mindset seems to be to retreat to safety, even if price-to-earnings ratios in sectors like utilities are higher than usual.  "Our thesis is that the rotation is hunting stability, and that traders are willing to bid up predictable long term cash flows," they wrote late Monday.   09:01 -  Sprint <S.N> is topping the premarket volume movers among S&P 500 components, with a better-than 3 percent gain following results that included revenue that matched analysts' forecasts [ID:nL2N0NL0GC]. More than 1.7 million shares have crossed before the bell. Merck <MRK.N> has given back a good chunk of its earlier gain, now up just 1 percent after its earnings vs more than 4 percent an hour or so ago. Coach <COH.N> is getting clobbered and it's gotten worse in the last hour after its North American comp-store sales fell 21 percent. It was last down more than 7 percent.

On the wider market, index futures' gains are holding, with the S&P e-minis <ESc1> now up 6 points vs 5.5 earlier.   08:33 - Tuesday's economic data calendar is once again light and for the second straight day housing is front and center <ECONUSTODAY>. Monday's data on the rebound in pending home sales volume offered hope that this winter's swoon in housing activity was largely a result of lousy weather. It did little to help housing-related stocks, though, with the $2 billion SPDR S&P Home Builder ETF <XHB.P> fading an early rally to close fractionally lower. The data this morning, the S&P/CaseShiller indexes <USSHPQ=ECI>, is all about prices and whether the pace of home value appreciation cooled off for a third straight month in February. The Reuters poll sees prices rising 13 percent from a year ago vs 13.2 percent in January. Year-over-year price gains peaked in November at 13.7 percent. Consumer confidence for April from the Conference Board <USCONC=ECI> is also on tap, with an expectation for that to tick up from the March reading, which was the strongest since the eve of the financial crisis back in January 2008. Ahead of the opening bell, the XHB is up 7 cents at $31.06 vs Monday's close of $30.99 on volume of 940 shares.  08:06 - U.S. index futures are all higher Tuesday morning, trending up with other global equities and on optimism about the tenor of the morning's corporate earnings. * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 5.5 points, about 0.30 percent, with just over 130,000 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100s <NDc1> are up 13.75 points, or 0.38 percent, on volume of 22 contracts. * The Dow industrials <DJc1> are up 42 points, or around 0.25 percent, with 55 contracts traded. * Outside of U.S. markets, the MSCI World Index <.MIWD00000PUS> is about a quarter of a percent higher and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index <.MSCIEF> is up by more than half a percent.
