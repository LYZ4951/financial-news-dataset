WARSAW, April 29 (Reuters) - BZ WBK <BZW.WA>, Poland's No.3 lender by assets and Spain's Banco Santander <SAN.MC> unit, expects to book a higher net profit in 2014 than last year's 2.015 billion zlotys ($663.04 million), its chief executive said on Tuesday.

"It will be a result of stable costs and very positive trends in provisions, which are going down because of the growing economy," CEO Mateusz Morawiecki told Reuters. "The growth (of the net profit) will exceed a 3-5 percent pace excluding one-offs," he added.
