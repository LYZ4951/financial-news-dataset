April 29 (Reuters) - Tuesday's economic data calendar is once again light and for the second straight day housing is front and center <ECONUSTODAY>.

Monday's data on the rebound in pending home sales volume offered hope that this winter's swoon in housing activity was largely a result of lousy weather. It did little to help housing-related stocks, though, with the $2 billion SPDR S&P Home Builder ETF <XHB.P> fading an early rally to close fractionally lower. The data this morning, the S&P/CaseShiller indexes <USSHPQ=ECI>, is all about prices and whether the pace of home value appreciation cooled off for a third straight month in February. The Reuters poll sees prices rising 13 percent from a year ago vs 13.2 percent in January. Year-over-year price gains peaked in November at 13.7 percent. Consumer confidence for April from the Conference Board <USCONC=ECI> is also on tap, with an expectation for that to tick up from the March reading, which was the strongest since the eve of the financial crisis back in January 2008. Ahead of the opening bell, the XHB is up 7 cents at $31.06 vs Monday's close of $30.99 on volume of 940 shares.
