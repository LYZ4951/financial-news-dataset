NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Stability is the name of the game right now in equity markets - something that can be seen in the daily moves in various speculative sectors and how investors react to outside influences like Russia and Ukraine (really, the primary factor motivating the more wild ups and downs in the stock market at this point).

Signs that the tensions may be thawing - and we've seen this movie before - contributed to a rebound in the Nasdaq and other indexes later in on Monday to leave the tech-heavy index basically unchanged on the session. But that didn't help the biotech stocks, and the cloud names like Workday and Salesforce.com (now riding a four-day losing streak), and the sharp declines in these names, is something the folks at Bespoke Investment Group in Harrison, New York suggest is a phenomena that newer investors haven't seen before. That is, when stocks just keep falling, and it shows that the break in momentum in these names hasn't been arrested.  "It's rare for a market to become that information-insensitive (in either direction), so this has been a great learning opportunity for traders that haven't seen a similar sort of move," they wrote.  It also gives lie to the idea that this was a tax-related selling issue. Meanwhile, the bigger tech names like Microsoft and IBM ended higher, and investors kept plowing money into utilities and telecom names like AT&T (snooze) or Verizon (snore).  As Bespoke puts it: "Our thesis is that the rotation is hunting stability, and that traders are willing to bid up predictable long term cash flows, with less emphasis on whether those cash flows are "rich" (high P/E) or "cheap" (low P/E)." Either way, it helps continue a run of outperformance the large-caps have managed against small-caps in recent history.  Mike O'Rourke of JonesTrading notes that just 32 percent of speculative positions in the Russell 2000 are long right now, a sharp drop from 59 percent in early March - yet still higher than the average 25 percent from 2007-2011. This suggests that if things get worse, more people could bet against the Russell.  (The small-cap Russell has had a notable run, in that it's about 350 days into a stretch of not closing below its 200-day moving average, a sign of long-term strength. Could this break be on the way? More knee-jerk selling would get us there.)
