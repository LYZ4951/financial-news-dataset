April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Sinochem Offshore Capital Company Limited's (Sinochem Offshore) USD500m 3.25% notes due 2019 a final 'A-' rating. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 22 April 2014 and follows the receipt of final documents conforming  to information already received. Sinochem Offshore is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sinochem Hong Kong (Group)  Company Limited (Sinochem HK; A-/Stable), which is providing an unconditional  and irrevocable guarantee for the US dollar notes issued under Sinochem  Offshore's medium-term note programme. The US dollar notes are rated at the same  level as Sinochem HK's senior unsecured rating to reflect this guarantee.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong State Linkage: Sinochem HK's parent, Sinochem Group (Sinochem), has  strong linkage to the Chinese state (A+/Stable) due to the importance of its  agrochemical operations, especially in seeds. The group also exhibits strong  state linkages in its rubber and other chemical operations. According to  Sinochem HK, the proportion of its long-term assets in the strategic  agrochemical and chemical sectors is 30%. This does not include its oil and gas  assets, including its contribution to the country's strategic reserves, which  account for more than 30% of the company's assets.  Role in Agricultural Modernisation: Sinochem's agrochemical operations are the  only horizontally and vertically integrated ones in China, with market coverage  of 95%. Soil enrichment, farmers' skill development and education, and bio-tech  R&D in agrochemicals are all essential tasks performed by Sinochem on a  quasi-commercial basis in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture to meet  the primary state objective of achieving and maintaining a certain level of food  production self-sufficiency. Past Investments Yielding Results: Fitch expects Sinochem HK's credit metrics to  improve in 2014, but this is sensitive to changes in global oil prices and the  new investments that Sinochem HK continues to make. Sinochem HK's large  investments in oil fields and property undertaken by its Hong Kong-listed  subsidiary Franshion Properties (China) Limited <0817.HK> (Franshion; BBB-/Stable) are  yielding results that support the improvement in Sinochem HK's credit metrics.  Its leverage, as measured by the net debt/EBITDAR ratio, fell to 3.7x in 2013  from 4.0x in 2012 and 6.0x in 2011. Sinochem HK's 2013 EBITDA rose by HKD1.1bn  even though Hong Kong-listed fertiliser subsidiary, Sinofert Holdings Limited <0297.HK>,  suffered a CNY1.1bn fall in its EBITDA in 2013.  Group Leverage to Fall: Sinochem's leverage is expected to fall in 2014 because  capex growth will slow after the completion of the Quanzhou refinery in 2013 and  the refinery will start to contribute to earnings from 2014. Although Sinochem's  EBITDA improved in 2013, due mostly to the stronger performance from Sinochem  HK, its net debt increased by 10% to CNY98.3bn, mainly because it had to finance  capex for the Quanzhou refinery. This drove 2013 leverage higher to 6.2x from  6.0x in 2012.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - Positive rating action on the Chinese sovereign - Strengthening linkages between Sinochem and the Chinese sovereign  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Negative rating action on the Chinese sovereign  - Weakening linkages between Sinochem HK and Sinochem
