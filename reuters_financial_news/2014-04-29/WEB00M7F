FRANKFURT, April 29 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's <DBKGn.DE> pretax profit fell by 30 percent in the first quarter to 1.68 billion euros ($2.33 billion), the bank said on Tuesday, depressed by an industry-wide slump in bond trading revenue.

Revenue in the investment banking division fell by more than a fifth, dragged down by a 10 percent fall in trading income, the bank said in a statement. The division includes Deutsche Bank's main trading unit - fixed income, currencies and commodities, or FICC.
