STOCKHOLM, April 29 (Reuters) - Swedish lenders should pass the latest European Banking Authority (EBA) stress test as they already meet stricter domestic benchmarks, the head of banking at Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said on Tuesday.

Asked if he expected Handelsbanken <SHBa.ST>, Nordea <NDA.ST>, SEB <SEBa.ST> and Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> to pass the EBA's test, Uldis Cerps, Executive Director for Banking at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority said: "We have no indications to the contrary."  "The stressed scenario used in this year's EU stress test is broadly comparable with ours, but the pass/fail threshold that we have used in our stress tests used to be higher."
