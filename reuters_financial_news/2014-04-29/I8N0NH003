MUMBAI, April 29 (Reuters) - Shares in India's Idea Cellular Ltd <IDEA.NS> gained 3.1 percent in pre-open trading on Tuesday after the wireless service provider posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

Idea Cellular reported on Monday a 90 percent jump in January-March consolidated net profit, and said it was confident about growth, as phone carriers benefit from reduced competition after a long price war. [ID:nL3N0NK3ZQ]
