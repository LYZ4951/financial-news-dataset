DUBLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - Irish telecoms firm eircom has appointed Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> to advise it on a possible stock market listing two weeks after announcing it was considering a third flotation in 15 years.

The two banks will "explore strategic options for the company including a potential international offering and listing," eircom said in a statement.  Earlier this month eircom said it had hired bank Rothschild to advise on a possible flotation. [ID:nL6N0N34G3] The former state telecoms operator filed for protection from its creditors two years ago to restructure 3.75 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of debt and was taken over by its senior lenders after cutting its debt by 40 percent.
