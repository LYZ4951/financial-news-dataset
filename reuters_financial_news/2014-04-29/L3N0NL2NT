HONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd <1398.HK> has agreed to buy a 75.5 percent stake in Turkey's Tekstil Bankasi <TEKST.IS> for $316 million, as the world's biggest lender seeks to benefit from the rising trade between the two countries.

ICBC <601398.SS> would make a tender offer to buy the remaining share in Tekstil Bank in due course, ICBC said in a statement on Tuesday. China is Turkey's third largest trading partner and the bilateral trade between the two countries totalled $28 billion, ICBC said in a statement, adding the deal will help ICBC to "better serve clients in both countries and satisfy their needs for global banking services".  The acquisition will also enable ICBC to explore new business opportunities with high growth potential, the statement said without giving more details. ICBC is buying the stake from GSD Holding, which is a Turkey-based holding company operating in the commercial banking, consumer financial services, portfolio management, and international trade sector.
