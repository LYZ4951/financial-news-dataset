WASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will press ahead with implementing large portions of a rule requiring companies to determine if their products contain "conflict minerals" from a war-torn part of Africa, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said Tuesday.

In testimony to a U.S. House of Representatives panel, White said a recent appeals court ruling that struck down a provision in the conflict minerals rule does not justify delaying the rest of the regulation's requirements.
