April 29 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned final ratings to AFG 2014-1 Trust Series 2014-1's residential mortgage-backed floating-rate notes, which are backed by prime Australian residential mortgages originated by AFG Securities Pty Ltd (AFGS). The ratings are as follows: AUD276.0m Class A notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; AUD14.5m Class AB notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; AUD9.0m Class B notes: Not Rated; and AUD0.5m Class C notes: Not Rated. The notes have been issued by Perpetual Corporate Trust Limited in its capacity  as trustee of AFG 2014-1 Trust in respect of Series 2014-1 (AFG 2014-1). AFGS is a securitisation funding business with the purpose of funding home loans  sourced by AFG Home Loans (AFG HL), the mortgage management division of the  Australian Finance Group Limited (AFG). AFGS holds an Australian credit license  and allows AFG HL to fund its own loans in addition to rebranding loans funded  by other wholesale lenders. At the cut-off date, the total collateral pool consisted of 1,240 loans totaling  approximately AUD299.8m. The weighted average (WA) current loan-to-value ratio  (LVR) is 66.5%, with an indexed current LVR of 65.5%. The pool is made up of  100% fully verified documentation loans, all of which are subject to a variable  interest rate. All loans are covered by lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI)  provided by Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Limited and QBE Lenders'  Mortgage Insurance Limited (Insurer Financial Strength rating: AA-/Stable). The  pool has geographically diversified, with the largest state concentration being  New South Wales (29.9%). Fitch has incorporated all the above factors in its  credit analysis of the transaction.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  Experienced Originator: AFG is an independent financial services group providing  residential and commercial loans, mortgage management and insurance services.  AFG was formed in 1994 and is one of Australia's largest wholesale providers to  the third-party introducer market, with a distribution network of more than  1,950 mortgage brokers. AFGS, a wholly owned subsidiary of AFG, was formed in  2006 to originate AFG's mortgage portfolio. Diverse Pool Characteristics: The WA seasoning of the portfolio is 13 months,  with a WA LVR of 66.5%. The pool is made up of 100% full documentation  mortgages, with investment loans representing 22.2% of the pool. The pool's  geographic distribution is generally representative of the population  distribution across Australian states. Class B Subordinated Interest: The Class B notes will accrue senior interest  based on the stated balance of those notes, while Class B subordinated interest  will accrue based on the charged-off Class B amount and will not be eligible for  liquidity support.  Sequential/Pro-Rata Paydown: Interest is paid sequentially (after expenses)  towards the Class A, AB, B, and then C notes. The reimbursement of all losses is  paid prior to the distribution of interest on the Class C notes. If certain  conditions are met, principal will be allocated pro-rata towards the Class A, AB  and B notes, while the Class C notes will not receive any principal until all  other notes are repaid in full.  Multiple Support Features: The ratings are based on: AFGS's mortgage  underwriting and servicing capabilities; the LMI policies covering 100% of the  pool; the threshold rate mechanism; and a liquidity facility equivalent to 1.0%  of the aggregate invested balance of the notes.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected decreases in the value of residential property, increases in the  frequency of foreclosures, and loss severity on defaulted mortgages could  produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case, which could in turn result in  negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the  ratings assigned to AFG 2014-1 Trust to increased defaults and decreased  recovery rates over the life of the transaction. Its analysis found that the  Class A notes' ratings remained stable under Fitch's medium (15% increase) and  severe default (30% increase) scenarios, while the Class AB notes are sensitive  to downgrade under Fitch's medium (15% increase) and severe default (30%  increase) scenarios. Recovery scenarios, both medium (15% decrease) and severe (30% decrease), did  not impact the rating of the Class A notes, while the Class AB notes were  susceptible to downgrade under both medium (15% decrease) and severe (30%  decrease) scenarios.  The Class A notes are susceptible to a downgrade under a combination of  increased defaults (30%) and decreased recovery (30%) while they remain  resilient under a medium stress of increased defaults (15%) and decreased  recovery (15%). The Class AB notes are susceptible to downgrade under all stress  scenarios that combine increased defaults and decreased recovery rates.
