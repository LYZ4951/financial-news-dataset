SEOUL, April 29 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> briefly hit a near six-year high against the dollar early on Tuesday on increased dollar sales by exporters and a rebound in Seoul stocks.

The won <KRW=KFTC> rose as high as 1,031.3 per dollar, its strongest since setting 1,030.0 on Aug. 12, 2008. It was last quoted at 1,031.8 as of 0016 GMT. Data released earlier in the day also underpinned the currency. South Korea's current account surplus narrowed in March from February but extended its string of surpluses for the 34th month on a seasonally adjusted basis, central bank data showed on Tuesday.
