BANGKOK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets mostly rose on Monday, with Philippine shares hitting a two-week closing high and notching up a 23 percent gain in 2014, while domestic fund buying helped lift regional large caps in a holiday-shortened week.

The Philippine main index <.PSI> rose 0.62 percent to 7,230.57, its highest close since Dec. 15, amid active buying in shares of Universal Robina Corp <URC.PS> and Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co <MBT.PS>.

[TH/TRADING02] Regional exchanges had a rangebound session and saw buying by local fund managers ahead the year's end. The Malaysian bourse said domestic institutions bought a net 89 million ringgit ($25.46 million) worth of shares, countering selling by foreign and retail investors.

Shares in AirAsia <AIRA.KL> fell 8.5 percent, their biggest one-day drop in more than three years after one of its aircraft went missing on its way to Singapore from the Indonesian city of Surabaya.
