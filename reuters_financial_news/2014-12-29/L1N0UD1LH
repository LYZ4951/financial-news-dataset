BOGOTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Colombia's current account deficit deepened to 4.6 percent of GDP in the January to September period or $12.86 billion, the central bank said on Monday, up from 3.3 percent in the same period last year, due to a larger trade deficit.

The deficit was partially offset by net current account transfers or money inflows to the country of $2.98 billion. Foreign direct investment shrank 4.8 percent in the nine-month period to $11.84 billion versus the same period in 2013, equivalent to 4.2 percent of gross domestic product. The deteriorating trade balance comes as Colombia's domestic demand booms with the economy sustaining annual expansion above 4 percent.
