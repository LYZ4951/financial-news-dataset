DUBAI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets may keep a firm tone on Monday after oil prices edged up from recent lows and as Asian equities provide a positive global background.

Saudi Arabia's 2015 budget, which will maintain spending at a high level despite lower oil revenues, has buoyed Gulf bourses in the last two sessions, helping them recover from a panic sell-off that was triggered by oil's plunge in early December. On Monday, Brent crude edged back up towards $60 per barrel as escalating clashes in Libya hurt supply. [ID:nL6N0UC0EG] Global equity markets are strong with MSCI's index of Asian stocks excluding Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> up 1.1 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] Some Gulf stocks, however, may see profit-taking after key announcements. Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank <1180.SE> lost 1.2 percent on Sunday after proposing a dividend of 0.65 riyal per share for the second half of 2014, its first since listing last month. [ID:nL6N0UC039] Another Saudi Arabian firm, dairy producer Almarai <2280.SE>, said late on Sunday its board recommended a cash dividend of 1 riyal per share for 2014, unchanged from 2013, which was in line with analysts' expectations but may disappoint some investors who had hoped for a higher payout.
