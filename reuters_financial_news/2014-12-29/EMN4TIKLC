NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Dec 24 Federal Reserve data showed on Monday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $22.3 billion to $1.052 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $23.5 billion to $983.1 billion.
