BRUSSELS, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Greece must strongly commit to Europe and back growth-friendly reforms if it is to thrive again within the euro area, European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Monday as the country headed for an early general election.

"Through this democratic process, the Greek people will once again decide on their future. A strong commitment to Europe and broad support among the Greek voters and political leaders for the necessary growth-friendly reform process will be essential for Greece to thrive again within the euro area," he said in a statement.
