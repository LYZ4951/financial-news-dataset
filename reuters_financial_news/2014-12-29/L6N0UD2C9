WARSAW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Poland's finance minister Mateusz Szczurek repeated on Monday that he is not worried by the zloty's recent weakening, which supports the economy, but he does see cause for concern in the pace of the currency's fluctuations.

"It is worth mentioning that we have a floating exchange rate regime. What may be worrying is the pace of a change," Szczurek told public radio. "We have a weakening to 4.3 (for euro). The very fact of such a weakness is not worrying from my point of view," he said, reiterating earlier comments. Szczurek also pointed out that zloty has recovered part of its losses on Monday.
