MUMBAI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Indian central bank on Monday relaxed rules to make it easier for domestic companies to borrow money and invest it overseas.

Under the new rules, companies can use a charge on their assets as security for the loans, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement late on Monday, (http://bit.ly/170kZup)  which previously required prior approval from the central bank. Companies can also use shares in overseas joint ventures as security.
