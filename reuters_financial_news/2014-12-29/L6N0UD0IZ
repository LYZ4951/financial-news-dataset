LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Stock markets in debt-laden Italy and Spain fell in early deals on Monday ahead of a presidential vote that threatens the future of Greece's international bailout.

Broader European indices were flat to slightly lower before the vote in Athens, which will decide whether the country goes to snap elections that could bring the left-wing Syriza party to power. Voting is due to start at midday (1000 GMT), with the result likely around an hour later.
