LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Greek government bond yields rose and stocks fell on Monday after parliament failed to elect a president at a final round of voting, paving the way for national elections early next year. [ID:nA8N0TB01A]

Yields on 10-year bonds <GR10YT=TWEB> rose above 9 percent, up more than 50 basis points on the day, forcing up yields on other low-rated euro zone government debt. The Athens composite equity index <.ATG> extended losses, falling 11.1 percent - one of its worst performances this year and just shy of a 12.8 percent slump on Dec. 9 as fears grew that Greece would face elections. Yields on 10-year German bonds - which investors tend to flock to in times of stress - fell to a record low of 0.564 percent.
