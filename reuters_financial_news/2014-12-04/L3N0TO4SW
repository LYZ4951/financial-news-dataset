Dec 4 (Reuters) - Uber said it raised $1.2 billion in its latest funding round and had additional capacity remaining for strategic investments, valuing the U.S. taxi service firm at $40 billion.

The funding would allow Uber to invest, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in a blog post on Thursday.
