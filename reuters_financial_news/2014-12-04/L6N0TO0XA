LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index edged up to trade near a 2-1/2-month high on Thursday, with an improving U.S. economic outlook and expectations of further stimulus from the European Central Bank helping the market.

Ryanair <RYA.I> jumped 8.7 percent, the top gainer in the FTSEurofirst 300 index, after raising its full-year profit guidance to between 810 million and 830 million euros from 750 million to 770 million after its passenger numbers jumped 22 percent in November. [ID:nL6N0TO0SU] Investors' focus was on ECB President Mario Draghi, who will present the bank's updated forecasts for growth in output as well as inflation at a policy meeting later in the day.  The ECB could extend a scheme to buy rebundled debt to purchasing corporate bonds, but it is unlikely to announce any radical immediate move such as printing money to buy government bonds. [ID:nL6N0TN2FT] At 0808 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.1 percent at 1,401.67 points after climbing to its highest level in more than two months in the previous session. The index has gained 15 percent since a one-year low in mid-October.
