SHANGHAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Shanghai Electric Power <600021.SS> said late on Thursday it was in preliminary contact with E.ON <EONGn.DE> over the possible purchase of the German utility's Italian coal assets, which the Chinese firm said were worth 150 million euros ($186 million).

Shanghai Electric said on Wednesday it was in contact with E.ON over its Italian assets, but did not give details. [ID:nL3N0TN1F0] It said in a statement on Thursday that formal negotiations had not been launched and the talks had not reached the due dilligence stage. E.ON is in the middle of a restructuring that will see it split its business in two to focus on renewable energy.
