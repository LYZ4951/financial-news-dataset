NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Dec 3 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $4.4 billion to $1.096 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $7.5 billion to $1.019 trillion.
