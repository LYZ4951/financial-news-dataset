WARSAW, Dec 4 (Reuters) - General Electric <GE.N> will invest $54 million in building a factory in Bielsko-Biala, southern Poland, where it already has a plant that produces energy distribution equipment, the U.S. company said on Thursday.

GE employees 800 people in Bielsko-Biala, but once the new unit is ready this could rise to up to 1200. The factory will include research laboratories and a training centre, GE said in a statement.
