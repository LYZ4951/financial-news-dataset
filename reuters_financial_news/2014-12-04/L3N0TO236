BANGKOK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Malaysian shares hit a 15-month low on Thursday as the ringgit extended losses amid concerns over the impact of declining oil prices. [O/R]

Most other Southeast Asian indexes edged higher in line with Asian stocks amid optimism about the U.S. economy. [MKTS/GLOB] The Kuala Lumpur composite index <.KLSE> was down 0.3 percent at 1,752.86, having earlier hit 1,743.62, its lowest since September 2013. The fall sent the index into oversold territory, with its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) slipping to 29.78. A level of 30 or lower indicates an oversold market. Technical indicators pointed to a rebound in the near term but any strong gain would be capped by the weakness in the ringgit, broker Affin Hwang Capital said in a report. The ringgit <MYR=MY> lost 0.2 percent to 3.4470 per dollar. Shares of Tenaga Nasional <TENA.KL> and Kuala Lumpur Kepong <KLKK.KL> were among the underperformers while shares of Petronas Chemicals Group <PCGB.KL> jumped 3.6 percent to 5.49 ringgit after a 6 percent drop in the preceding three days. Broker Maybank IB Research upgraded Petronas Chemicals Group to 'buy' from 'hold', citing the stock's low valuations. "We think current level is a good buying opportunity, as the blanket de-rating of the oil and gas sector overshadows many of PCHEM's attributes," it said in a report. Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> was up 0.3 percent after a 0.6 percent loss on Wednesday. Shares of CapitaLand <CATL.SI> rose 0.3 percent after its unit acquired property in Jakarta, while weak sentiment on oil and gas related stocks continued to hit shares such as Keppel Corporation <KPLM.SI>. [ID:nWNAS009N3] Jakarta <.JKSE> edged up 0.2 percent, with lower oil prices helping ease concerns over the country's fiscal and trade deficit. A central bank official said Indonesia's current account deficit is expected to fall below 3 percent of gross domestic product this year due to a sharp drop in global oil markets and last month's hike in domestic subsidised fuel prices.
