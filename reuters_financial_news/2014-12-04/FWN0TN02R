LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Pay-TV group Sky <SKYB.L> said on Thursday it had agreed to sell a controlling stake in Sky Bet to CVC Capital Partners <CVC.UL> in a move which values the online betting business at 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion).

Sky, which operates in Britain, Italy, Germany, Austria and Ireland, said it would receive 600 million pounds in cash at completion and would retain a stake of around 20 percent in Sky Bet.  It could also receive extra funds based on CVC receiving a certain return on its investment.
