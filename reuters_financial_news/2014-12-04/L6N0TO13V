VIENNA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The sale of Austrian home-improvements store chain BauMax is under way, with a deadline for binding offers ending on Dec. 18, Austrian magazine News said on Thursday, citing documents from investment bank Mediobanca.

BauMax, which had overextended itself with a push into Eastern Europe and Turkey, had said in late November that there was no sale process. [ID:nL6N0TB3KR] It was not immediately available for comment. The sale focuses on BauMax core countries Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where it generates 70 percent, or 745 million euros ($917 million), of its revenues, News said. Any deal would need a green light from BauMax's creditor banks, including Raiffeisen <RBIV.VI>, Erste Group <ERST.VI> and Bank Austria <CRDI.MI>.
