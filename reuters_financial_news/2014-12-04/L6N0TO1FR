MOSCOW, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble strengthened after President Vladimir Putin promised several economic reforms, including an amnesty on capital returning to Russia and a freeze on taxes.

The Russian currency had fallen sharply when Putin began the speech with harsh criticism of the West over the crisis in Ukraine and defended Moscow's policy there.
