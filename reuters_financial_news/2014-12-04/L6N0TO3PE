LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Fidelity, one of the world's biggest asset managers, backed holding peripheral European government bonds and corporate bonds as among its favoured positions in the fixed income market.

"The periphery looks quite good value," said Andrew Wells, global chief investment officer for fixed income at Fidelity. The euro <EUR=> and bond yields in the currency bloc spiked and shares stumbled on Thursday after the European Central Bank stuck to its line that it will judge early in 2015 whether more action is needed to revive the euro zone economy.
