ACCRA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The Bank of Ghana said the yield on its 91-day bill rose to 25.7910 percent at an auction on Thursday, from 25.7727 percent at the last sale.    The bank said it accepted 520.37 million cedis ($161.85 million) of the 520.40 million cedis worth of bids tendered for the 91-day paper.
