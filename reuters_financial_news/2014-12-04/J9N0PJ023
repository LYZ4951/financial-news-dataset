JAKARTA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's current account deficit is expected to fall below 3 percent of gross domestic product this year due to a sharp drop in global oil markets and last month's hike in domestic subsidised fuel prices, a central bank official said.

Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Hendar told reporters on Thursday that the current account deficit narrows by around $170 million for every $1 drop in global oil prices. The current account deficit in the third quarter narrowed sharply to 3.07 percent of GDP, compared with 4.07 percent in the previous quarter.
