SEOUL, Dec 4 (Reuters) - South Korea's government has suspended the sale of a controlling stake in Woori Bank <000030.KS> valued at around $2.7 billion, the country's financial regulator said on Thursday.

The announcement by the Financial Services Commission was widely expected after the government's fourth attempt to sell a controlling stake in Woori Bank collapsed on Friday after attracting a lone bid. Analysts had valued the 30 percent stake on sale this time at about 3 trillion won ($2.71 billion). [ID:nL3N0TI2QX] Under South Korean rules, at least two bidders were needed for the sale to proceed.
