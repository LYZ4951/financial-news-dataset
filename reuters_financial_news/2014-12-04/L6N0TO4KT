PARIS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The French government is selling a 49.9 percent stake in the Toulouse Blagnac airport in southwestern France to a Chinese-led consortium, the Economy Ministry said on Thursday.

A consortium made up of Shandong Hi-Speed Group and Friedmann Pacific Asset Management made the winning bid for the stake, the ministry said. "It's not a privatisation, but rather the capital is being opened up with the local authorities and the state remaining majority holders with 50.01 percent," Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron was quoted as saying in regional newspaper La Depeche du Midi.
