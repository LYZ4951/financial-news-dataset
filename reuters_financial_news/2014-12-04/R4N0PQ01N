MOSCOW, Dec 4 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin proposed an amnesty on Thursday for those returning capital to Russia, indicating they would not face tax or other penalties.

Russian officials have said they expect net capital outflows this year to soar far above $100 billion, with the country facing the possibility of recession and the rouble sliding against the dollar.
