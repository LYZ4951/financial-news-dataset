WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Regulators should consider tighter rules for clearing houses given their crucial role as guardians against market routs after the 2007-2009 credit crisis, a senior U.S. swaps regulator said on Thursday.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission should take a first step towards subjecting clearing houses to more standardized regular checks of their financial health, known as stress tests, CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen said. "The CFTC should begin a public dialogue to consider these issues, and should do so through a concept release seeking comment or through one of its advisory committees," he said in a speech. A concept release is a document the industry can comment on, and often a first step towards rule-making.  Wetjen said he would call a meeting of the agency's Global Markets Advisory Committee, a group to consult with the industry that he chairs, to discuss the issue "this winter." Clearing became mandatory for much of the $690 trillion global derivatives markets after the 2007-09 crisis, shifting risk from Wall Street banks to clearing houses, which are market operators that stand between buyers and sellers. But industry heavyweights such as JP Morgan Chase <JPM.N> and Blackrock <BX.N> have been pointing out the catastrophic impact should a clearing house collapse, demanding tighter oversight and greater capital buffers. And Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell last month also called for tighter oversight. [ID:nL1N0SW28L] The remarks by Wetjen are significant because the CFTC directly regulates two big clearing houses, run by the CME Group Inc <CME.O>, the world's largest futures exchange, and the Intercontinental Exchange Inc <ICE.N>. The CFTC also should consider a rule requiring clearing houses to put more of their own capital at risk if a market party defaults, Wetjen said. Currently, they can rely solely on collateral put up by market parties, though in practice, they already have some "skin in the game."
