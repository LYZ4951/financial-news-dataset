SYDNEY, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Australian construction activity shrank in November with industry players complaining of slow public building activity, project delays and a further decline in new mining-related projects.

The overall index of construction activity dropped 8.0 points to 45.4 in November, falling below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction, a report by the Australia Industry Group and Australian Housing Association showed. The rate of expansion in detached house and apartment building activity also slowed in November, the survey showed.
