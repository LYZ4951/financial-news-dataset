SAO PAULO Dec 4 (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, rose 0.69 in November,  from an increase of 0.37 in Oct, the IPC-FIPE index <BRFIPE=ECI> showed on Thursday.  Economists see the FIPE index as an early gauge of Brazil's benchmark IPCA inflation index, which the central bank targets when setting interest rates.  The index measures inflation within the boundaries of the city of Sao Paulo and does not include prices in the wider metropolitan area.  Below are the results for the FIPE index price categories: ==================================================   Item (pct change)      November      October ================================================== - Housing                    0.19         0.38 - Food                       1.55         0.85 - Transportation             0.21         0.07 - Personal care              1.24        -0.12 - Health                     0.71         0.44 - Clothing                   0.72         0.37 - Education                  0.05         0.21 ================================================== - INDEX                      0.69         0.37  (For the Fipe report see: http://www.fipe.org.br/)  Reporting by Silvio Cascione silvio.cascione@thomsonreuters.com +55-11-5644-7758 Reuters Messaging: silvio.cascione.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net
