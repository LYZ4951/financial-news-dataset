MOSCOW, Dec 4 (Reuters) - The Russian central bank said on Thursday it was considering only measures of an economic character against foreign exchange market speculators and did not plan administrative restrictions that would limit trading.

"Introduction of mandatory sales of foreign currency revenues is not being considered," the bank also said in e-mailed comments.  It said, however, that if it saw evidence of manipulation in the forex market, it would initiate an investigation.
