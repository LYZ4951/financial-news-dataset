Dec 4 (Reuters) - Closely watched bond investor Bill Gross on Thursday lambasted  central banks around the world for unconventional monetary easing and advised investors to curb risk-taking going into 2015 as global markets are reaching "the point of low return" and diminishing liquidity.

Gross, who oversees the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund <JUCAX.O>, said "investors may want to begin to take some chips off the table," given the current environment. "Raise asset quality, reduce duration, and prepare for at least a halt of asset appreciation engineered upon a false central bank premise of artificial yields, QE (Quantitative Easing) and the trickling down of faux wealth to the working class."
