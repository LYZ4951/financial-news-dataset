LAGOS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Nigeria's currency opened for trade at 179.53 naira <NGN=D1> to the dollar on Thursday, up 0.21 percent from its previous close, Thomson Reuters data showed.

At a separate forex auction late on Wednesday the central bank sold $289 million at 168 naira to the greenback, higher than the $200 million it offered, to meet demand for dollars.
