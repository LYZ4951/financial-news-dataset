CAIRO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday but strengthened on the unofficial market.

The bank offered $40 million on Thursday and said it had sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Wednesday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.
