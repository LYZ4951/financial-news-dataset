TIRANA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Albanian President Bujar Nishani will this week pick out from a list of three nominees who he wants as central bank governor after the 10-year incumbency of Ardian Fullani.

Media reports on Thursday said Nishani had short-listed Arjan Kadare, a former member of the bank's supervisory board, Genti Sejko, the deputy manager of a commercial bank in Albania and Nick Markola, director of research at a Connecticut bank. Fullani was sacked by parliament three years into his second seven-year mandate following his arrest on charges of negligence after an employee stole 713 million lek ($6.28 million). He has since been freed ahead of trial. Three members of the supervisory board need also to be selected. It is unclear if the new governor would serve the remainder of Fullani's mandate or a full seven-year term. Since Fullani left in mid-September, Nishani and Prime Minister Edi Rama have had several meetings to pick a new governor, with Nishani wishing him to be an Albanian while Rama voicing his preference for a foreigner. Parliament controlled by Rama's Socialists and their allies will have the final say on Nishani's nominee.
