Dec 4 (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce <CM.TO> reported a nearly 2 percent fall in fourth-quarter profit, hurt by lower interest income.

Excluding items, the bank earned C$2.24 per share, falling short of the average analyst estimate of C$2.25, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [ID:nCNW5zzhpa]
