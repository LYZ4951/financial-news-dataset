BUDAPEST, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Hungary's government has signed a preliminary agreement to buy Budapest Bank, the country's eighth-biggest lender, from GE Capital, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told a news conference on Thursday.

Economy Minister Mihaly Varga said the transaction was expected to close by the end of July 2015. Varga declined to comment on the price, and expressed hope the purchase would boost competition in the banking sector.
