BRASILIA, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation could spike in the short term and remain high, but price increases should begin to slow in 2015, the bank said in the minutes of its last rate-setting meeting released on Thursday.

The central bank last week raised its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> by 50 basis points to 11.75 percent, stepping up monetary tightening to battle inflation and reinforce President Dilma Rousseff's efforts to regain investors' confidence. [ID:nL2N0TN0J0]
