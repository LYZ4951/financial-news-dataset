HELSINKI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Council Member Erkki Liikanen said on Thursday an ability to act came ahead of unanimity at the ECB in future decisions.

"Unanimity is always a good goal. Most important is the ability to act in all circumstances," he said.  "I am not ruling out anything or selecting anything at this stage, let's just keep the ability to act in place."
