NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S.-based stock funds saw net outflows of $2.9 billion through the week ended Dec. 10, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

But, echoing a pattern seen for much of the year, the behavior of investors in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds diverged sharply.  Investors in mutual funds, thought to represent the behavior of retail investors,  pulled a net $7.8 billion from stock funds in the seven-day period. In contrast, investors in stock ETFs poured a net $4.9 billion into the funds over the same time.
