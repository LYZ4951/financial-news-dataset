LAGOS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank sold an undisclosed amount of dollars to commercial lenders on Thursday, but failed to lift naira currency, which ended lower against the greenback, dealers said.

The unit <NGN=D1> closed at 181.10 to the dollar, down 0.66 percent from the previous day's close.
