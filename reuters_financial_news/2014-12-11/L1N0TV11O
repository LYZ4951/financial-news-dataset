NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications to purchase new homes fell 22 percent in November from October, as first-time home buyers struggled to obtain loans due to tight credit conditions, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Thursday.

The Washington-based group's home builder application survey (BAS) showed the loan size to buy a home averaged $307,000 last month, up from about $300,000 in October. The latest data suggested "builders are having greater success with higher priced homes and difficulty at the entry level, as first-time buyers continued to face tight credit conditions," Mike Fratantoni, MBA's chief economist, said in a statement. The MBA estimated new single-family home sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 401,000 units in November, based on the survey data from the BAS. This was down 13 percent from October's 461,000 unit annualized pace.
