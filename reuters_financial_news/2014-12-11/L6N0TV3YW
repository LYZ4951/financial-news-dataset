LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Songbird Estates <SBDE.L>, the subject of a 2.6 billion pound   ($4 billion) hostile takeover bid from a Qatari-led group, said it was too early to speculate on the intentions of the majority of its shareholders.

The company, the owner of London's Canary Wharf financial district, said it was issuing a statement in response to press comment after a British media outlet said investors were poised to reject the Qatari bid.
