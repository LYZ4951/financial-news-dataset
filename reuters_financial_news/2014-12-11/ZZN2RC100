SHANGHAI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - China stocks closed down on Thursday, hit by a slump in brokerages after local media reported that the regulator had set up a team to check brokers' margin business.

The CSI300 index <.CSI300> of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.2 percent, to 3,183.01, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> lost 0.5 percent, to 2,925.74 points. Sina Financial, a domestic Internet media firm, reported on Thursday that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC)had set up a special team to investigate brokerages' margin business and some of them could be punished. Investors were also worried over market liquidity after CSRC approved ahead of schedule 12 IPOs late on Wednesday, a move which could cool a blistering rally in the country's stock markets which has seen the benchmark CSI index surge more than 30 percent in two weeks.
