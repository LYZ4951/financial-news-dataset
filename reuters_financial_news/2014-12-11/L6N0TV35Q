LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine's sovereign bonds rallied as much as two cents on Thursday as traders bet western lenders would help the country fend off a default after a plea for funds from Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk.

Ukraine's dollar bond maturing in 2022 rose two cents on the dollar to 67 cents in the dollar while the 2017 bond was up 1.26 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed. <US903724AF9=TE> <XS091760584=TE> Earlier, Yatseniuk said Ukraine risks defaulting unless western lenders put more money on the table. [ID:nL6N0TV1L1] "The expectation that funding will come from the west is a reasonable assumption despite the fact there is a distressed situation in Ukraine... Ukraine is too strategic for Europe," said Regis Chatellier, credit strategist at Societe Generale.  Earlier on Thursday a senior official of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said international lenders are likely to help if Ukraine's government pushes through reforms.
