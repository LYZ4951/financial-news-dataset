LAGOS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main share index fell almost 3 percent to its lowest level in 22 months on Thursday, as investors sold stocks in the banking, consumer and oil sectors.

Foreign investors, who dominate trade on Nigeria's bourse, have been selling out of the country's banking, consumer and oil sectors as the price of Brent crude <LCOc1> - the benchmark against which the country's oil is priced - plunged.[nL6N0T93XG] The drop in oil prices has put Nigeria's currency under pressure and dampened appetite for assets in Africa's biggest economy, prompting the central bank to devalue the naira <NGN=D1> by 8 percent to halt a slide in its foreign reserves. The index <.NGSEINDEX> shed 2.9 percent to 31,270 at 1150 GMT, a level last seen on Jan. 23, 2013. The index of Nigeria's top-10 lenders <.NGSEBNK10> shed 3.56 percent, while the consumer goods index <.NGSEFBT10> is down 2.74 percent.
