PARIS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - European shares fell in early trading on Thursday, losing ground for the fourth session in a row, as the slump in oil and iron ore prices knocked resource-related shares lower and fuelled worries over the pace of global growth.

At 0805 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,355.87 points. The index has lost 3.5 percent so far this week.
