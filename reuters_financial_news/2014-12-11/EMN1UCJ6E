NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Dec 10 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $9 billion to $1.087 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $0.6 billion to $1.020 trillion.
