SARAJEVO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Turkey's state-run stock exchange Borsa Istanbul is keen to increase its 5 percent stake in Bosnia's Sarajevo Stock Exchange (SASE) to more than 30 percent via an auction scheduled for Jan. 12, SASE said on Thursday.

Borsa Istanbul owns 308 SASE shares and wants to acquire a further 1,536 shares when they go on sale next month, SASE said in a statement. The maximum price is set at 360 Bosnian marka ($228.1) per share. The Borsa is Turkey's only exchange, created from the 2013 merger of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Gold Exchange and Derivatives Exchange ahead of a planned privatisation. In 2011, the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Takasbank and Turkish central securities depository each acquired 5-percent stakes in the SASE, which is owned by Bosnian brokerages.
