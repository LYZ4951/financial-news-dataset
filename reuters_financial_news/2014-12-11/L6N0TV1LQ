LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The euro and lower-rated European bond yields hit the day's lows on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it had allotted 129.8 billion euros in its second tranche of ultra-cheap long-term loans to banks.

The figure was just shy of the 130 billion euros forecast in a Reuters poll, reinforcing expectations the ECB will need to take more aggressive policy measures if it is to succeed in expanding its balance sheet by up to 1 trillion euros. European equities extended gains after the tender results. The Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> was up by 0.7 percent while the Euro Stoxx Banks Index <.SX7E> rose 0.8 percent.  The single currency fell to $1.2414 <EUR=>, down 0.3 percent on the day while Spanish and Italian 10-year yields hit the day's low of 1.84 percent <ES10YT=TWEB> and 2.01 percent <IT10YT=TWEB> respectively.
