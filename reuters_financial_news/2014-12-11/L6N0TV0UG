NAIROBI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Kenya's central bank intervened on Thursday to sell dollars for the second week in a row, helping the shilling strengthen from a new three-year low, traders said.

By 0740 GMT, the shilling was trading at 90.50/60 against the dollar from 90.65/75 earlier, it's lowest level since November 2011. The bank also intervened on Wednesday last week when the shilling neared the 90.50 level.
