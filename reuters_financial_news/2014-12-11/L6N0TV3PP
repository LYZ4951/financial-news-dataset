LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Top-rated euro zone bond yields inched lower on Thursday after a lacklustre response by banks to the European Central Bank's second round of long-term loans, improving the chances for more aggressive stimulus measures.

Greek bonds and other riskier debt bucked the trend, as political upheaval in Athens spooked investors. Greece's shorter-term yields <GR3YT=TWEB> pushed further above those for longer-term debt <GR10YT=TWEB> after Prime Minister Antonis Samaras warned of a "catastrophic" return to a crisis that nearly pushed Greece out of the euro. The yield inversion is a sign investors fear the country may again head towards default. [ID:nL6N0TV2ZD] Greece's malaise took the gloss off an earlier rally after banks borrowed just under 130 billion euros in the TLTROs. The four-year loans are central to ECB plans to expand its balance sheet by up to 1 trillion euros($1.25 trillion) to revive euro zone growth. But their total take-up is now just 212.4 billion euros, far short of the target. [ID:nL6N0TV1UX] The borrowing will not even offset the 287.2 billion euros of outstanding three-year loans that banks have to repay by February. The ECB appears unlikely to meet the goal for its balance sheet except through buying sovereign bonds -- the quantitative easing (QE) opposed by Germany and some other euro zone states. http://link.reuters.com/nyd53w   "The size of the TLTRO take-up is not high enough to reduce the likelihood that QE will come," said Felix Hermann, market strategist at DZ Bank. [ID:nL6N0TU1HF] "... I would expect QE speculation to rise again, especially to the run-up to the January ECB meeting."   German 10-year yields <DE10YT=TWEB>, the yardstick for euro zone borrowing costs, closed down around 1 basis points at 0.68 percent, coming off an earlier record low of 0.657 percent. All other top-rated euro zone bond yields were a fraction lower on the day, near historic lows. The rise in Greek yields weighed on other low-rated bonds, however. Samaras, who has gambled by moving the presidential vote up to this month, appealed to lawmakers to elect a head of state to avert a national election next month that the leftist Syriza party would probably win. Spanish bond yields -- one of the bellwethers for the bloc's southern periphery -- were up 1 bp at 1.88 percent. Italy's were flat at 2.06 percent. They had earlier hit day's lows after the TLTRO announcement.
