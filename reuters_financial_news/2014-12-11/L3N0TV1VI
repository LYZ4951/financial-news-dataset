HANOI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> fell 0.29 percent at the break on Thursday as energy shares failed to attract buying after OPEC cut its 2015 oil demand forecast to the lowest in a decade, while an upgrade by Moody's on banks boosted appetite.

Brent crude ticked higher but not far above five-year lows hit in the previous session, with the market's bearish tone largely intact as OPEC group on Wednesday expected its 2015 global demand to fall to the lowest level in more than a decade. [ID:nL3N0TU1KQ] PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's top firm by market value, fell 0.68 percent, while Petrovietnam Drilling & Well Services Corp <PVD.HM> eased 1.48 percent from a short recovery on Wednesday on bargain hunting. Buying into banks provided a cushion for the market as five out of six lenders gained, led by Military Commercial Joint Stock Bank <MBB.HM> with a 1.55-percent rise and Hanoi-based VietinBank <CTG.HM> that increased 0.7 percent. Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday it has upgraded outlook for Vietnam's banking system to stable from negative, citing stable macro-economy and lower liquidity stress, but said assets quality and profit outlook remained concerning.
