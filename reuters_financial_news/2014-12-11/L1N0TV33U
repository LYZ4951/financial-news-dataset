SAO PAULO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Exchange operator BM&FBovespa SA <BVMF3.SA> will extend for another year a plan to repurchase up to 60 million shares, or 3.3 percent of its shares outstanding, it said in a securities filing on Thursday.

The year-old plan had been scheduled to end Dec. 31. In a separate statement, Sao Paulo-based BM&F said its board also decided to expand its investments in the next two years.  Investments for 2015 were raised to between 200 million and 230 million reais ($75 million and $86.8 million) from a previous goal of 190 million to 220 million reais. In 2016, BM&F plans to invest 165 million to 195 million reais.
