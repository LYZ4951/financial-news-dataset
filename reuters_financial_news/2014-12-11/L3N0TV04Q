SHANGHAI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - China's largest budget carrier Spring Airlines Co Ltd said it was seeking to raise 1.76 billion yuan ($284.96 million) in a Shanghai initial public offering to fund a fleet expansion.

Spring Airlines first announced plans to raise 2.5 billion yuan in April, but the China Securities Regulatory Commission put the deal on hold in May without giving a reason.
