MILAN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <FCHA.MI> <FCAU.N> denied on Thursday a media report which suggested it was considering to move the tax residence of its luxury sportscar unit Ferrari outside Italy.

FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said in October he would spin off Ferrari from the group next year, sell a 10 percent stake via a public offering and distribute the rest of FCA's stake in the unit to its shareholders. [ID:nL5N0SO536]
