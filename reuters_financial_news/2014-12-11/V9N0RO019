VIENNA, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Erste Group Bank <ERST.VI> bid for 1.8 billion euros ($2.24 billion) in the European Central Bank's latest round of targetted long-term loans (TLTRO) that aims to boost bank lending, the Austrian lender said on Thursday.

The group has already identified opportunities to lend to non-financial corporate clients. "Demand for lending has increased only recently, however mostly driven by supply rather than demand," a spokeswoman said by email.
