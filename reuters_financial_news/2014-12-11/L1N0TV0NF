SAO PAULO, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Companies in Brazil requested fewer loans from financial institutions in November, credit research company Serasa Experian said on Thursday, reflecting rising borrowing costs, dwindling business confidence and a flagging economic activity outlook for next year.

A Serasa index that gauges demand for credit among large-, mid- and small-sized companies dropped 10 percent in a month-on-month basis in November, the company said in a statement. On an annual basis, demand for corporate loans recovered as requests rose 7.9 percent. In the statement, Serasa attributed the decline in credit demand to the rising cost of borrowing that is specially afflicting the smaller companies. The central bank last week raised for a second straight time the benchmark Selic overnight lending rate, and most economists expect it to further hike in the first months of 2015.
