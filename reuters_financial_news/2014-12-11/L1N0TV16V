WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to launch a sweeping set of reforms designed to ensure that large asset managers are properly dealing with risks and have plans to wind down in the event of a major market disruption.

SEC Chair Mary Jo White announced the three-prong plan in a speech at The New York Times Dealbook conference in New York, saying it will "lay the foundation for a renewed focus on regulating the risks arising from the portfolio composition and operations of investment advisers."
