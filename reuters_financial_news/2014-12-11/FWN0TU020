COPENHAGEN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Danish engineering company FLSmidth <FLS.CO> said on Thursday it had extended its core 5 billion Danish crown ($837 million)  revolving credit facility for five years.

"The credit facility covers the group's financing needs for the coming years and will result in reduced financing costs," it said in a release published just ahead of the start of it capital markets day in Copenhagen.
