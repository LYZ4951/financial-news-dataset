VIENNA, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Austria plans to file a suit by the end of the year relating to the 2009 nationalisation of Hype Alpe Adria if compensation talks with the bank's former owner BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] do not succeed, Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling told parliament on Thursday.

The two sides had agreed for two years to extend the statute of limitations for filing such a suit, with the deadline now set to expire on Dec. 31.
