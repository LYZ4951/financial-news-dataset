MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Thursday it had conducted $348 million worth of forex market interventions on Dec. 9.

This follows $400 million in interventions on Dec. 8 and around $4.5 billion in interventions last week to support the rouble, despite the central bank floating the currency in November.
