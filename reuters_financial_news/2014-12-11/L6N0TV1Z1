MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Russia's Finance Ministry may take some money from its National Wealth Fund to put in banks' deposits in January, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev was quoted as saying by RIA news agency on Thursday.

The state is planning to use some of the NWF to support firms hit by sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and will channel funds via banks in the first stage. Energy company Novatek <NVTK.MM> is among those that will benefit to help its Yamal LNG (liquefied natural gas) project.
