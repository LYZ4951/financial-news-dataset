Dec 11 (Reuters) - The initial public offering of Ireland's Avolon Holdings <IPO-AVOL.N> was priced at $20 per share, an underwriter said, valuing at $1.6 billion the world's ninth-largest aircraft leasing firm by assets.

The IPO of 13.6 million shares, priced below the expected range of $21-23, raised about $272.7 million. Shares of Avolon, which was founded by leasing entrepreneurs Domhnal Slattery and John Higgins in 2010, are expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The company filed for a New York listing in June, only to be approached by China Investment Corp and Chinese state aerospace firm AVIC Capital <600705.SS>.  Confirming an earlier Reuters story, AVIC said last week it had cancelled its approach after the Irish company turned down the offer.

Companies hope to capitalize on growing interest in aviation from longer-term investors such as insurers and pension funds, who are hoping to boost yields. [ID:nL5N0KY292]
