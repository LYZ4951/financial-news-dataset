Dec 11 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined ten major banks a total of $43.5 million for allowing equity research analysts to solicit investment banking business, the Wall Street watchdog said on Thursday.

The firms also offered favorable research coverage in connection with the 2010 planned initial public offering of Toys "R" Us, FINRA said. None of the firms admitted or denied FINRA's allegations, the watchdog said.
