NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Canada's housing market is not in a bubble despite overvaluation estimated at between 10 to 30 percent, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Thursday.

"We don't think we suddenly became over-valued in a bubbly type way. We don't think of this as a bubble in any way," Poloz told a business audience in New York.
