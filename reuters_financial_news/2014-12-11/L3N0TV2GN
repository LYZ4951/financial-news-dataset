BEIJING, Dec 11 (Reuters) - China has told its banks to issue more loans in the final months of 2014 in its biggest-ever lending surge as authorities step up efforts to bolster growth in the world's second-largest economy, sources told Reuters on Thursday.

Two sources with knowledge of the matter said China has raised its 2014 lending target to a record 10 trillion yuan  ($1.6 trillion), up from a previous 9.5 trillion yuan target that was reported in Chinese media.
