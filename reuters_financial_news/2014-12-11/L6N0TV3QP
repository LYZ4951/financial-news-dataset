PARIS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> took 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) of low-cost, long-term loans on offer from the European Central Bank on Thursday, France's biggest lender said.

"BNP Paribas has taken 14 billion in the December TLTRO window at a group level," a BNP spokeswoman said after a second offering this year of almost zero-cost loans to banks.
