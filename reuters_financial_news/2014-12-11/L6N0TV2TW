MOSCOW, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The governor of Russia's central bank Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday the bank was ready to be flexible and use non-standard measures to preserve financial stability.

Speaking after the central bank raised rates by 100 basis points to curb inflation and halt a sharp slide in the rouble, Nabiullina told a news conference that Russia could see capital outflows of up to $120 billion in 2015.
