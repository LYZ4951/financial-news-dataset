June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its criteria assumptions for assessing credit risk in Italian residential mortgage loan pools. The updated assumptions are expected to have a limited impact on existing Italian RMBS ratings and no impact on covered bonds ratings. Potentially  affected ratings will be reviewed within six months. Most of the agency's assumptions - including base and stressed default as well  as quick sale assumptions - have remained unchanged given Fitch's stable view on  the Italian mortgage and housing market.  Some assumptions have been slightly adjusted based on a regression analysis  conducted on a sample of over 143,000 residential mortgage loans in Italy. The  agency has recalibrated its foreclosure frequency (FF) matrix, some FF  adjustments for specific loan/borrower/property characteristics, and the  property value thresholds of illiquid properties. In particular, the FF  adjustment for non-Italian borrowers has increased, a change supported by the  materially worse observed performance of these borrowers in Fitch-rated RMBS as  compared with Italian nationals.  Fitch has moderated its house price decline (HPD) assumptions given that the  Italian housing market has performed broadly in line with the agency's  expectations. The HPD assumptions at 'AA+sf' remain stable at 43%. Nominal house  prices have recently started flattening, supported by a stabilising outlook for  house price drivers, including new retail lending volumes and affordability for  new housing transactions. Therefore, Fitch has slightly reduced its  peak-to-trough assumption at 'Bsf' to 20% from 22%, and as a result now assumes  a further house price fall of 7% from 4Q13 levels. To align its national HPD  expectations with regional ones, Fitch has changed its source of data when  indexing property values. This has also resulted in the recalibration of its  regional market value declines. Low prepayment stresses have been reduced to 2% in each year after closing in  light of observed trends in Fitch-rated RMBS. This reflects the stabilisation of  prepayment rates at low levels due to the currently low interest rate  environment and subdued new lending.  The application of the revised assumptions is expected to have a limited effect  on existing ratings of Italian RMBS transactions. There are few transactions  with significant exposure to non-Italian borrowers; therefore the change in  related assumptions will have little effect on the analysis of portfolios. The  revised assumptions on non-Italian borrowers may result in a lower breakeven  asset percentage for Italian covered bonds programmes secured by cover pools  with a significant portion of these loans, albeit no rating impact is expected. In the review of transactions, Fitch will apply the revised assumptions but will  also consider the historical performance of the particular loans in question.
