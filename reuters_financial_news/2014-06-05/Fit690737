June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its criteria  assumptions for assessing credit risk in Spanish residential mortgage loan  pools. The updated assumptions are expected to have a limited effect on the  existing Spanish RMBS and no effect on covered bond ratings. Potentially  affected ratings will be reviewed within the six months. Most of the agency's credit assumptions for analysing securities backed by  Spanish residential mortgage loans have not materially changed from the previous  criteria. The updated criteria introduce recalibrated assumptions such as  foreclosure frequency and default expectation for loans in arrears. The report  also modifies some of the loan-specific or borrower adjustments based on a  regression over a sample of 89,000 loans and new evidence from Spanish RMBS  transactions and historical data. On foreclosure frequency, our base case expectation remains stable and  consequently a portfolio of typical residential mortgages with an original loan  to value between 75% and 80%, a debt to income between 30% and 40% and exposure  to average borrower and loan flexibility features, would carry a foreclosure  frequency assumption of around 7.7% under a 'Bsf' rating scenario. Foreclosure frequency adjustments for employment type, mortgage purpose, and  property type (first or second) have been recalibrated. The adjustment for  borrowers with an employment status that differs from a long-term employment  contract, and  for pensioners, has increased to 60% from 25%, and the adjustment  for mortgage loans for purposes that differ from home ownership has been  increased to 50% from 25%. The foreclosure frequency adjustment for loans linked  to second homes has been increased to 50% from 25%. On recovery, our base case peak-to-trough house price decline expectation  remains stable at 40%, while the quick sale adjustment continues to be 45%. Cash  flow-related assumptions, such as prepayments or foreclosure timing remain  unchanged, but fixed foreclosure costs have been adjusted downwards to EUR3,000  from EUR6,000. While Fitch recognises that some house prices indices indicate a  slower pace of correction since late 2013, the agency maintains its  peak-to-trough house price decline assumption given that the fundamentals of the  Spanish housing market remain unchanged. It should be noted that there are few transactions with significant exposure to  borrowers with employment status that differs from a long-term employment  contract and those with mortgages granted for purposes other than home  ownership, as well as second homes. Therefore the change in related assumptions  will have little effect on the analysis of portfolios. In the review of transactions, Fitch will apply the revised assumption, but will  also consider the historical performance of particular loans in question.

The report  should be read together with "EMEA RMBS Master Rating Criteria", "EMEA  Residential Mortgage Loss Criteria", and "EMEA RMBS Cash Flow Analysis  Criteria", dated 28 May 2014 for a comprehensive understanding of Fitch's  approach to rating Spanish RMBS.
