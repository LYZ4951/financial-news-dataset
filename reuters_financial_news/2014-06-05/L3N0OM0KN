HONG KONG, June 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> has named John Kim as its new head of mergers and acquisitions for Asia ex-Japan, taking over from Richard Campbell-Breeden, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.

Campbell-Breeden was named vice-chairman of the investment banking division for Asia ex-Japan, and chairman of M&A for the region, the memo said. Kim, who was Goldman's co-country head of South Korea, is relocating to Hong Kong from Seoul, the U.S.-based investment bank said.
