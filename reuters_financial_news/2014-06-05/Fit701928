June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

High levels of undistributed foreign earnings can flatter the post-tax earnings and credit metrics of US multinationals, potentially leading investors to underestimate the financial risk of an issuer, Fitch Ratings says. We address this in our ratings by evaluating the credit  profile of both the domestic and consolidated entity and potentially taking  rating action if these profiles become unbalanced. Undistributed foreign earnings (UFE), the profits earned by foreign subsidiaries  that have not been remitted back to the parent, are growing fast for many US  multinationals. While US corporations are taxed on worldwide earnings, this  normally happens only when those overseas earnings are distributed to the US  parent. Additionally, US accounting rules exempt corporates from having to  recognise deferred tax liabilities on these earnings if they will be  indefinitely reinvested abroad.  This means investors can underestimate credit risk, because companies may not be  able to access their entire reported cash balance without having to pay  significant taxes. There are several circumstances in which US multinationals may need to remit  cash back to the US, crystallising a tax liability. These include if the  domestic business cannot support cash expenses including returns to shareholder  and debt service, or if debt maturities arise at a time when markets are shut  and the debt cannot be refinanced. A crackdown on the tax mitigation strategies  many companies use could also lead to the creation of tax liabilities that did  not previously need to be recorded. Our analysis of 40 large US multinational companies shows UFE can have a  significant impact on both earnings and credit metrics. On average the exemption  from recording a tax liability on the difference between foreign and US tax  rates boosted basic earnings per share by 18%.  Applying a conservative haircut  to FFO to account for US taxes on foreign earnings, FFO adjusted leverage for  the sample rose by an average of 0.3x. We address these potential distortions by evaluating the financial profile of  both the foreign activities and the domestic business, which must pay returns to  shareholders and debt holders purely from its domestic and received foreign  earnings. A deteriorating domestic credit profile can lead to rating action.  This was a factor in our revision of Coca-Cola's <KO.N> Outlook to Negative from Stable  in February.
