June 5 (Reuters) - German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse AG <DB1Gn.DE> may sell U.S. options business International Securities Exchange Holdings Inc, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which bought ISE for $2.8 billion in 2007, has been planning a sale but is yet to reach out to any buyers, Bloomberg reported. The deal may fetch $1 billion to $1.5 billion, Bloomberg said, citing one of the people. (http://link.reuters.com/hen89v) Deutsche Boerse is considering a sale of ISE after stiff competition in the U.S. options market stymied ISE's growth prospects, the Bloomberg report said.
