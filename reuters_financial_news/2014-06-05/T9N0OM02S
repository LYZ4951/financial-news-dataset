TOKYO, June 6 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told the health minister to accelerate an asset allocation review by the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's biggest pension system, and complete it by this autumn instead of by next March, sources familiar with the situation said.

Earlier this week, the ministry completed an evaluation of the public pension system that paved the way for GPIF to begin the review of its asset allocations, a process set to shift more money into stocks and less into domestic bonds.
