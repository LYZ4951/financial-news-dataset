June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published the National Long-Term Rating on CTBC Bank Co., Ltd.'s [CTRUSC.UL] (CTBC Bank) upcoming TWD20bn perpetual non-cumulative subordinated bonds of 'A(twn)', on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).   The company's subordinated bonds will be issued in two tranches of TWD10bn each.  They carry fixed coupon rates of 3.7% and 4.0%, with first call dates being 10  years and 12 years after issuance respectively. The proceeds, which qualify as  Taiwanese Basel III Tier 1 capital, will be used to refinance maturing debts and  enhance the bank's capitalization.   KEY RATING DRIVER - Debt Rating Fitch rates the bonds four notches down from CTBC Bank's anchor rating, its  Viability Rating (VR) of 'a' that is equivalent to 'AA+(twn)' on the National  Rating scale. The notching comprises two notches for non-performance risk, based  on standard and less-easily triggered profit and capital thresholds for coupon  omission and deferral, and two notches for poor recovery prospects. The notching  is in accordance with Fitch's criteria on rating bank subordinated and hybrid  securities.  The bank's VR is currently on RWN because the planned acquisition of The Tokyo  Star Bank, Ltd. [TKOST.UL] (Tokyo Star Bank) by CTBC Bank will probably weaken the bank's  core capitalisation and consolidated earnings quality. Fitch will resolve the  Rating Watch when there is greater clarity on CTBC Bank's consolidated  financials, likely in August 2014. Tokyo Star Bank follows Basel II standards  for its capital requirements and Japanese GAAP for its financial reporting,  while CTBC Bank uses Basel III standards and IFRS.  Fitch does not ascribe any equity credit to the instrument as it does not accord  full discretion to the issuer on coupon payments, which limits its loss  absorption flexibility to support the issuer's viability.
