June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Santander Holdings USA <SOV_pc.N> (SHUSA) to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. This action follows Fitch's recent rating action on SHUSA's parent company, Banco Santander SA <SAN.MC> (refer to press release titled 'Fitch Upgrades Santander and BBVA to 'A-'; Stable Outlook', dated May 29, 2014 for additional information). See the full list of rating actions at the end of this  rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT  As a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander SA, SHUSA's ratings are driven  by its parent company. SHUSA's ratings are notched one level below its parent,  since it is strategically important to, but not considered a core subsidiary of  Banco Santander SA by Fitch. Thus, with Banco Santander SA's upgrade to 'A-',  SHUSA's support-driven IDR was upgraded to 'BBB+'.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT  Since SHUSA's ratings and Outlook are correlated with those of Banco Santander  SA, changes in Banco Santander SA's ratings may result in changes to SHUSA's'  IDRs and Outlook. Banco Santander SA's Rating Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING  SHUSA's support-driven IDR has historically been one notch below Banco Santander  SA, reflecting Fitch's view that SHUSA is strategically important to Banco  Santander SA, though not core. Since SHUSA' support reflects institutional  support, no support rating floor is assigned.  In the event Fitch views SHUSA as no longer strategically important to Banco  Santander SA, its support rating could be downgraded. If it were downgraded,  SHUSA'S IDR would be notched down from the parent company by two or more  notches.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES  Given that SHUSA does not have a VR, the subordinated debt and other hybrid  securities issued by SHUSA and by various issuing vehicles are all notched down  from SHUSA's IDR in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Their  ratings are all primarily sensitive to any changes in the SHUSA's IDR, which is  linked to Banco Santander SA.   KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY  SHUSA's IDRs are equalized with those of Santander Bank, N.A., reflecting its  role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a  source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Should SHUSA's holding company  begin to exhibit signs of weakness, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR from the ratings of Santander Bank, N.A.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS  SHUSA's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. The ratings of long- and  short-term deposits issued by SHUSA and its subsidiaries are primarily sensitive  to any change in SHUSA's long- and short-term IDRs.   The following ratings are upgraded: Santander Holdings USA --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; Outlook Stable from Negative; --Senior Unsecured to 'BBB+' from 'BBB';   Santander Bank, N.A. [SOVBAN.UL] (Formerly Sovereign Bank N.A.) --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'; Outlook Stable from Negative; --Long-term deposit rating to 'A-' from 'BBB+'; --Subordinated debt to 'BBB' from 'BBB-';   Sovereign Capital Trust VI [SOVCF.UL] --Preferred stock to 'BB' from 'BB-'.   Sovereign Real Estate Investment Trust Holdings --Preferred stock to 'BB-' from 'B+'.   The following ratings are affirmed: Santander Holdings USA --Support at '2'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'. --Commercial paper at 'F2';  Santander Bank, N.A. --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Support Rating at '2';
