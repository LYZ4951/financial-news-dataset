MOSCOW, June 5 (Reuters) - Russian consumer credit firm TCS <TCSq.L> is expected to post a 6 percent fall in first-quarter net profit due to higher loan loss provisions since the Ukraine crisis and a slowdown in Russian economic growth, a Reuters poll of seven analysts showed.

TCS, owner of Tinkoff Credit Systems, which went public in London in October, is expected to post net profit of 969.7 million roubles ($27.6 million) when it reports on Monday, the poll showed. The company posted net profit equivalent to 1.03 billion roubles in the same period last year, when it reported in dollars. TCS, founded and majority owned by Russian entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, focuses on Russia's regions, where it delivers credit cards by courier. Russia's top lenders Sberbank <SBER.MM> and VTB <VTBR.MM> last week reported steep falls in net profit and a rise in bad loan provisions, reflecting the damage caused by the Ukraine crisis.
