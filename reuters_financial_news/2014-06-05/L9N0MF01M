LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British house prices spiked 3.9 percent higher in May, breaking two months of falls and leaving house prices in the three months to May 8.7 percent higher than a year earlier, mortgage lender Halifax said on Thursday.

The jump in house prices last month was more than five times greater than the forecast 0.7 percent rise in a Reuters poll, and Halifax did not offer any immediate explanation, beyond noting that monthly figures were sometimes volatile. The increase brings the year-on-year rate of growth closer in line with that of the rival Nationwide measure, which is up more than 11 percent on the year.
