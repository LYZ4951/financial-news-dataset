MILAN, June 5 (Reuters) - Bailed-out lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> priced its upcoming 5-billion euro rights issue at a big discount as it sought to lure investors for a vital cash call meant to avert nationalisation.

In a statement late on Thursday, the Tuscan lender said it would offer new shares in the bank at 1 euro each, or a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price calculated on Thursday's closing stock price. The capital increase starts on Monday.
