SINGAPORE, June 5 (Reuters) - Singapore shares tracked losses in regional markets, as data from China showing a slowdown in its services sector dampened market sentiment, while Frasers Centrepoint Ltd <FRCT.SI> extended losses after announcing a surprise bid for an Australian firm.

The main Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> was down 0.2 percent at 3,276.12, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> dipped 0.2 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] HSBC/Markit's measure of China's services sector dropped to 50.7 in May from April's 51.4, raising questions on whether Beijing needs to do more to put a floor beneath growth. [ID:nL3N0OL12J] Frasers Centrepoint continued to fall for a second day after the property developer made a surprise A$2.6 billion ($2.41 billion) cash takeover bid for Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX>, trumping an offer from Australian firm Stockland Corp Ltd SGP.AX. Shares of the company were down 2.4 percent at S$1.81. [ID:nL3N0OK4Y5] CIMB maintained its "add" rating on the stock with a target price of S$2.09, saying the deal makes strategic sense though it has a slightly negative financial impact. The brokerage said it would revise its rating if a bidding war occurs and Frasers Centrepoint significantly overpays for Australand. Among other stocks, shares of semiconductor packaging firm Stats Chippac Ltd <STTS.SI> dropped 7.3 percent to S$0.57 after soaring as much as 25.5 percent on Wednesday. In response to a trading query from the bourse, Stats Chippac said it had been approached by other parties about a possible acquisition of the company after it announced an expression of interest from a third party in mid-May. Bucking the trend, W Corporation Ltd <WCOR.SI> jumped 7.4 percent, stretching gains into a third straight session after announcing a S$490.9 million ($391 million) reverse takeover by e-commerce firm YuuZoo on Tuesday.
