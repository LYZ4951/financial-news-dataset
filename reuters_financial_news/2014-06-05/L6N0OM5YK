FRANKFURT, June 5 (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> is considering the sale of its International Securities Exchange (ISE), a source familiar with the company's thinking said on Thursday.

No banks have been mandated to assist Deutsche Boerse with a sale of its U.S. options exchange, the person said, adding that valuation levels were currently not attractive enough for Deutsche Boerse to pursue a sale in the short run. The move follows a series of setbacks in the United States for the Frankfurt-based exchange operator including a failure to gain permission to offer options on some key U.S. indexes.
