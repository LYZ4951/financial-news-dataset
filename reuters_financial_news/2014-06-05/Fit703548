June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed MutRe's Insurer  Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'A-' with a Stable Outlook.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the company's strong capital position, the financial  flexibility provided by its committed shareholder base, its consistent strategy  and its solid franchise in the French accident and health reinsurance market.  The rating remains constrained by the company's small size and geographical  concentration and its exposure to potential pandemic risks not fully covered by  the company's retrocession programme. In addition, Fitch believes that the  company's size makes it more susceptible than larger companies to operational  risks and to changes in the external operating environment. According to Fitch's own capital assessment, MutRe's capitalisation remains  strong and commensurate with the rating. At end-2013 the regulatory Solvency I  ratio had improved to 230% (201% in 2012). In 2013 MutRe's net profit almost  doubled to EUR6m. The underwriting result had materially recovered, especially  in life to EUR7.5m (2012:EUR1.6m), driven by reserve releases and reinsurance  recoveries. The company reported a stable non-life net combined ratio of 103%.  Nevertheless, the low interest rate environment continues to constrain  investment return as assets are managed relatively cautiously and invested  mainly in high-quality fixed-income assets. However, Fitch expects MutRe's  profitability to remain relatively resilient in the foreseeable future driven by  the company's selective underwriting policy and expected positive development in  long-term care and protection. MutRe is a French reinsurance company with shareholder's funds of EUR127m and  gross written premiums of EUR369m in 2013. Major business lines are health  (53%), protection (mostly death and disability, 33%) and long term care (14%).  MutRe predominantly offers proportional reinsurance treaties to more than 50  French primary insurers, mostly mutual organisations.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key ratings triggers for a downgrade include a failure to maintain profitability  (as measured, for example, by the three-year average combined ratio failing to  stay below 105%) or a sustained decline of the regulatory solvency ratio to  below 170%. In addition, MutRe's rating could be downgraded if the company were  unable to renew contracts and maintain its franchise.
