MUMBAI, June 5 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended at a fresh closing high on Thursday, helped by gains in resources stocks such as Sesa Sterlite on continued optimism over the revival of the domestic economy.

Metal stocks continued to gain, surging for the third straight day on the back of positive China factory surveys earlier this week. The sentiment was further underpinned as overseas investors bought Indian shares worth $32.25 million on Wednesday, in a third straight session of buying. "There are no visible near-term negatives. Investors are building portfolios ahead of the union budget, which would be the next big event. FIIs (foreign institutional investors)continue to support. The undercurrent is still positive," said Suresh Parmar, head of institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets.
