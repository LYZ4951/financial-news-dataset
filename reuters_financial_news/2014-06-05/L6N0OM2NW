PARIS, June 5 (Reuters) - France raised the stakes on a possible U.S. fine on its largest bank, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, warning on Thursday that it could affect ongoing EU-U.S. talks on a major trans-Atlantic trade deal.

"We must all completely respect the independence of the justice system. But we are also partners with a relationship of trust, and that trust must not be broken," Finance Minister Michel Sapin told Le Monde daily in an interview. "This could affect the ongoing talks on the free-trade treaty."
