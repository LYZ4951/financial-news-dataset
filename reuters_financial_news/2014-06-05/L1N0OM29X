WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - The regulator for two U.S. state-run mortgage financiers asked for public comment on Thursday regarding fees the firms charge lenders.

"Input must be received within 60 days," the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said in a statement. The FHFA regulates Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB>, which guarantee most of the nation's mortgages.
