ROME, June 5 (Reuters) - Alitalia's creditor banks have not yet reached agreement with Abu Dhabi airline Etihad over the struggling Italian carrier's 800 million euro ($1.09 billion) debt burden, a source close to the negotiations said on Thursday.

"We still have to work on it," the source said. How to treat Alitalia's debt has been a key sticking point in the negotiations between Etihad, the banks and the Italian government as they seek to hammer out a rescue deal for the loss-making airline.
