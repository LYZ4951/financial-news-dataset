HONG KONG, June 5 (Reuters) - China's main share index snapped four days of losses on Thursday, supported by strong gains in media companies as investors regained confidence in the sector's growth.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> rebounded from losses in the morning and ended up 0.8 percent at 2,040.88 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings gained 1.1 percent, its best day in more than three weeks. Some media companies were among the top percentage winners on the indexes. Chengdu B-Ray Media <600880.SS> soared the maximum allowed 10 percent in Shanghai. Beijing Gehua CATV Network <600037.SS> climbed 6.8 percent to a three-year high after the company said it signed an agreement with China Mobile on 4G development late on Wednesday.
