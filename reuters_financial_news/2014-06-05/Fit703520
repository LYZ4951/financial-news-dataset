June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited's <BPCL.NS> (BPCL) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'BBB-'. The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, the agency has affirmed BPCL's senior unsecured rating of 'BBB-' and the 'BBB-' ratings on its USD500m and CHF200m senior unsecured notes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Government Linkage:  BPCL has very strong linkages - operationally and  strategically - with its 54.9% shareholder, the Indian state (BBB-/Stable). Its  rating is equalised with that of India based on Fitch's Parent Subsidiary  Linkage criteria. The prices of around two thirds of the petroleum products  (including retail diesel, public distribution kerosene and household LPG)  marketed by BPCL are regulated by the government, and sold at prices lower than  international market prices. The government funds the under recoveries (UR;  difference between market prices and regulated prices) partly through direct  budgetary support and by directing upstream oil companies to provide discounts  to BPCL.Significant Player:  BPCL is the third-largest refiner in the country with a  capacity of 30.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) that accounted for 14% of  capacity in India, and the second-largest marketer of petroleum products with a  21% market share. In the financial year ended March 2014 (FY14), BPCL marketed  34.3mtpa (FY13: 33.7mtpa) domestically and exported 3.1mtpa (FY13: 3.2mtpa) and  refined 28.7mtpa (FY:13 28.6mtpa) of petroleum products.  Under Recoveries Impact Working Capital and Debt:  BPCL's gross UR in FY14 was  INR345bn (FY13: INR390bn), which was covered by government subsidies of INR184bn  (FY13: INR219bn) and discounts from upstream players of INR156bn (FY13:  INR168bn). BPCL shouldered INR5.1bn of the UR (FY13: INR2.5bn). BPCL's working  capital position has been impacted because of delays in the receipt of subsidy  payments from the state.  Diesel accounted for 52% of BPCL's FY14 UR. In the first two months of FY15, the  diesel UR has fallen to an average of INR4.9 per litre compared with INR8.4 in  FY14 and INR11.0 in FY13. Fitch expects the government to continue to gradually  increase the price of diesel. Provided there is no further weakening of the  Indian rupee nor a sustained increase in oil prices, the proportion and quantum  of the subsidy payment will reduce, which will have a positive impact on BPCL's  working capital and related debt requirement. High Capex Plans:  BPCL has outlined a fairly high capex plan of more than  INR300bn over the next four years. The largest part of the capex is for the  expansion of the Kochi refinery to 15.5mtpa from the current 9.5mtpa at a cost  of around INR142bn. The high capex is likely to lead to continued negative free  cash flows over the next four to five years.  Upstream Discoveries: BPCL has 20 upstream blocks (eight in India and 12  abroad), of which it has some successful discoveries - notably in the Rovuma  Basin in Mozambique (in which it has 10% participating interest), in its  Brazilian assets (20% participating interest), and West Australian onshore  assets in Perth (27.8% stake). The Mozambique asset is assessed at having  recoverable resources of 50trn-70trn cubic feet of natural gas, and the  investors in the project also plan to set up a natural gas liquefaction plant  with two trains with an initial capacity of 5mmtpa each.  Credit Profile to Weaken:  At FYE14, BPCL had a net leverage (net debt/EBITDA)  of 2.8x (FYE13: 3.8x) and interest cover of 4.7x (FYE13: 2.6x). With BPCL  expected to generate negative free cash flows, Fitch expects the company's net  leverage to increase to around 5x over the next two to three years. BPCL has a  comfortable liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of INR69bn at  FYE14 (FYE13: INR80bn). The company also enjoys good access to international and  domestic capital markets.RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include -An upgrade of India's sovereign rating provided that BPCL's current linkages  with the state are maintained Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include -A downgrade of India's sovereign rating
