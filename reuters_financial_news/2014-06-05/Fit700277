June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its criteria assumptions for  assessing credit risk in Greek residential mortgage loan pools. The updated  assumptions do not have any impact on the existing Greek RMBS and covered bond  ratings.  Following further weakening of the Greek housing market Fitch has made its house  price decline assumptions more conservative.  Fitch's base default expectations  on Greek mortgage pools have remained unchanged; however, some borrower and  product specific foreclosure frequency (FF) adjustments have increased, as  borrowers with loans secured by second homes and unemployed borrowers have shown  heightened probabilities of default as part of the performed regression  analysis. FF adjustment for loans in arrears has been revised upwards to reflect  a high portion of loans becoming delinquent and the potential difficulty of  these loans returning to performing due to a stressful economic environment. Following the upgrade of the Greek sovereign Country Ceiling to 'BB' from 'B+'  (see 'Fitch Upgrades Greece to 'B'; Outlook Stable' dated 23 May 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com), Fitch has added assumptions for rating scenarios up to  'BB'. House prices in Greece have declined by 34% on average from their 2008 peak  across regions. Fitch expects Greek house prices to suffer a further decline  from current levels of approximately 16% over the medium term in the context of  the severe recession the country is going through and the uncertainty  surrounding the real estate taxation framework. Fitch has revised upwards its  average peak-to-trough house price decline expectation for Greece to 45% from  42% in nominal terms.  Fitch has maintained the FF floor in the range of 40%-60% for loans that have  been subject to a restructuring, as the agency believes that borrowers who have  experienced problems servicing their mortgages and who have thus opted for a  "restructuring" package are more susceptible to economic shocks. Fitch has  revised upwards servicing costs assumption as the level of loans in arrears is  high and volume of restructured loans is expected to increase. For Greek banks  loan restructure is a main method for dealing with the high levels of arrears  while the property foreclosure ban is in place.
