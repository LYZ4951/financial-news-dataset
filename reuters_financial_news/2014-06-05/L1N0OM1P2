NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - The General Motors Co <GM.N> board of directors has asked the automaker's general counsel, Michael Millikin, a key counselor to Chief Executive Mary Barra, to stay beyond the mandatory retirement age of 65, a GM spokesman said on Thursday.

Millikin, 65, has been the company's top in-house lawyer since 2009. A report released on Thursday prepared by outside counsel spared him of the harshest criticism leveled against GM for an ignition-switch defect.
