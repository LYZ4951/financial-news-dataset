FRANKFURT, June 5 (Reuters) - A Frankfurt-based court gave Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> the green light to proceed with a 6.3 billion euro ($8.9 billion) rights issue on Thursday, one day after the bank's plans stalled due to a procedural bottleneck.

An official at the register court, responsible for recording the names of shareholders, said the 60 million shares purchased by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al-Thani of Qatar were registered as of Thursday.
