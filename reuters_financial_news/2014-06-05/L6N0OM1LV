DUBAI, June 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's market regulator has suspended trading in Etihad Atheeb <7040.SE> after the landline operator failed to disclose sufficient details on a network sharing deal with Saudi Telecom Co <7010.SE> (STC), according to a bourse filing on Thursday.

Earlier on Thursday, Atheeb said it had signed a so-called Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRU) agreement that gives it access to 30,000 STC data connections for 15 years, with an option to increase this to 100,000 connections. [ID:nL6N0OM1BX]
