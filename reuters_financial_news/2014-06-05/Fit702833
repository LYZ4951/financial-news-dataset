June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Scandinavian Consumer Loans IV's (SCL IV) notes final ratings, as follows: NOK934.5m floating rate Class A, due January 2037: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable NOK210m floating rate Class B, due January 2037: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable NOK357m floating rate Class C, due January 2037: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable NOK210m floating rate Class D, due January 2037: 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable SCL IV is incorporated in Sweden as a special purpose vehicle with limited  liability and is wholly owned by Nordax Finans AB (publ) (Nordax, the  originator, seller, and servicer).  The issue proceeds were used to purchase a portfolio of Norwegian unsecured  consumer loan receivables towards Norwegian individuals. Pool data for the  initial portfolio was provided to Fitch with a cut-off date of 22 May 2014, when  the pool totalled NOK2,119m and comprised 12,196 loans with an average current  balance of NOK173,779.  The ratings are based on Fitch's assessment of Nordax's origination and  servicing procedures, Fitch's expectations of future asset performance, the  available credit enhancement, and the transaction's legal structure.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  High Historical Default Rates The underlying loans are unsecured consumer loans that historically have  experienced high default rates. This risk is mitigated by the high recovery  rates and yield the portfolio generates. Fitch used the default multiple to  include an element of stress, including the potential portfolio migration during  the 24-month revolving period.  Based on this approach, Fitch applied a weighted average (WA) default base case  of 16.2% and a stress of 3.8x at the 'AAAsf' level. The agency has used a WA  recovery assumption of 43.9%, which was stressed with a high recovery haircut  (50% for 'AAAsf') to reflect the unsecured nature of the underlying receivables.  Counterparty Exposure  As a SPV wholly owned by Nordax, the structure is unusual relative to  securitisations in most other European jurisdictions; however, Fitch is  confident in legal opinion that an insolvency of Nordax will not cause the SPV  to be consolidated or forced into insolvency. Fitch's confidence is reinforced  by the successful use of this type of SPV structure in previous Swedish  securitisations.  Asset Outlook Stable Norwegian household indebtedness has increased substantially in the last 15  years, with housing credit making up the bulk of the debt due to increasing  prices. Therefore, the economy remains sensitive to the housing sector. Fitch  expects unemployment rates to remain stable in Norway and the agency does not  expect interest rates to change significantly in the medium term. Overall, Fitch  expects asset performance to remain stable relative to historical levels.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected increases in the default rate and loss severity on defaulted loans  could produce loss levels higher than the Fitch's assumption could result in  rating actions on the notes. Rating Sensitivity to Increased Default Rate Assumptions Class A/B/C/D notes Current ratings: 'AAAsf'/ AAsf'/'Asf'/'A-sf' Increase in default rate by 10%: 'AA+sf'/'AA-sf'/'A-sf'/'BBB+sf' Increase in default rate by 25%: 'AAsf'/'Asf'/'BBB+sf'/'BBBsf' Increase in default rate by 50%: 'AA-sf'/'A-sf'/'BBB-sf'/'BB+sf' Rating Sensitivity to Reduced Recovery Rate Assumptions Class A/B/C/D notes Current ratings: 'AAAsf'/ AAsf'/'Asf'/'A-sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 10%: 'AAAsf'/'AAsf'/'Asf'/'A-sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 25%: 'AAAsf'/'AAsf'/'Asf'/'A-sf' Decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'AAAsf'/'AAsf'/'A-sf'/'BBB+sf' Rating Sensitivity to Multiple Factors Class A/B/C/D notes Current ratings: : 'AAAsf'/ AAsf'/'Asf'/'A-sf' Increase in default rate by 10%, decrease in recovery rate by 10%:  'AA+sf'/'AA-sf'/'A-sf'/'BBB+sf' Increase in default rate by 25%, decrease in recovery rate by 25%:  'AAsf'/'Asf'/'BBBsf'/'BBBsf' Increase in default rate by 50%, decrease in recovery rate by 50%:  'A+sf'/'BBB+sf'/'BB+sf'/'BB+sf' The transaction features a 24-month revolving period unless terminated earlier  following an early amortisation event. After the revolving period has ended, the  notes will start amortising in sequential order. A step-up date occurs 12 months  after the scheduled amortisation date whereby the note margins will double.  The seller acts as initial servicer, with a hot back-up servicer in place from  closing (Emric Finance Process Outsourcing AB). The issuer bank accounts are  held with Nordea Bank AB <NDA.ST> (AA-/Stable/F1+) and the reserves are held with  Citibank N.A., London branch(A/Stable/F1).  Excess spread provides the first layer of protection against losses. The initial  credit enhancement for the notes is provided by overcollateralisation and the  credit enhancement reserve. The class A, B, C and D notes have 57.5%, 47.5%,  30.5% and 20.5% credit enhancement, respectively.
