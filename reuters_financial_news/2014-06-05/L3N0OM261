BANGKOK, June 5 (Reuters) - Thai shares rose on Thursday as optimism around the domestic economy gave more boost to consumer and hotelier shares while Philippine stocks were range-bound amid expectations of a possible interest rate hike after higher inflation in May.

Most Southeast Asian stock markets recouped early losses and closed higher as the European Central Bank is expected to ease monetary policy later on Thursday to support a fragile economic recovery. [MKTS/GLOB] <ECONEUROPE>  The SET index <.SETI> closed up 0.26 percent at 1,453.16, falling at one point to 1,444.98. Gains were led by shares of Big C Supercenter <BIGC.BK> and Minor International <MINT.BK>. Shares of ethanol producer Thai Agro Energy <TAE.BK> more than doubled on their debut as investors built an exposure into  alternative energy business. The stock closed at 5.6 baht versus the initial public offering price of 2.0 baht. The military government's economic policy to revive domestic consumption and investment underpinned market sentiment. The index had risen almost 12 percent so far this year, Asia's fifth best, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Philippine main index <.PSI> ended a tad higher. Philippine inflation quickened in May to a two-and-a-half year high on costlier food and utilities, prompting expectations the central bank could raise interest rates.
