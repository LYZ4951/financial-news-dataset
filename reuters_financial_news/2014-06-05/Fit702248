June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its mortgage loss criteria addendum for South Africa. This update does not have any impact on outstanding ratings. The most material change brought by Fitch to the criteria is an increase in the  property sale and legal costs assumptions; this follows a back-testing analysis  showing that a combination of a variable plus a fixed component of costs better  reflect the actual observations. For some portfolios this may result in slightly  increased cost assumptions. Fitch, however, believes that this rise in assumed  costs is compensated for by the housing appreciation of 2013. For the purpose of  determining recoveries upon default, the agency will now consider the ABSA house  price index updated to Q413 - as opposed to Q412 in the previous criteria  version. Other small changes include an update of the property value thresholds used to  adjust the recoveries on particularly low- and high-value properties; and a  higher adjustment for valuations provided by the Lightstone automated valuation  model (AVM) when related to very high-value properties. These changes do not  affect existing transaction ratings. Fitch may also adjust upwards the default probability of loans underwritten  after 1 April 2014, when certain information on adverse credit and paid-up  judgements was due to be deleted from credit bureaus as per new regulation. This  adjustment will be transaction-specific, and will be decided in light of  additional information from lenders as to the practical impact of this  regulation on their underwriting of new loans.  Mortgage performance has been stable since the last criteria review. It also  means, however, that the performance improvement seen in 2011 and 2012 may have  come to an end. Fitch maintains a Stable Outlook for South African mortgage  performance, while the downside risks from a downturn in the economy or any  substantial increase in interest rates remain. While housing affordability has been slightly receding since around the  beginning of 2012, it is in Fitch's view still better than 2011, when the  current market value decline (MVD) assumptions were first established. The  agency also found from available data that the mortgage industry made  significant progress in working out the defaults mainly inherited from the  crisis years of 2008 and 2009, reflecting an improvement in the liquidity of the  housing market since the last review. The report entitled "Criteria Addendum - South Africa: Mortgage Loss and Cash  Flow Assumptions", replaces the report of the same name dated 21 February 2013.  The report should be read together with "EMEA RMBS Master Rating Criteria",  "EMEA Residential Mortgage Loss Criteria", and "EMEA RMBS Cash Flow Analysis  Criteria", dated 28 May 2014 for a comprehensive understanding of Fitch's  approach to rating South African RMBS.
