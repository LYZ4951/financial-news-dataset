LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Poland is likely to see prices falling below zero in the next couple of months while monetary easing by the European Central Bank would lead to a stronger zloty, the country's finance minister said on Thursday.

"I am certainly concerned about deflation - we are expecting a temporary dip below zero inflation," Mateusz Szczurek told Reuters and Reuters Insider Television in an interview on the sidelines of the Institute of International Finance spring meetings. "It's quite possible in the next couple of months." Polish inflation fell to 0.3 percent in April, defying analysts' forecasts for a pick-up and moving further below the central bank's 2.5 percent inflation target. The decision by the European Central Bank on Thursday to cut rates and provide greater liquidity would drive money to Polish assets, creating a stronger currency, but this was not a concern, Szczurek said. The ECB cut interest rates to record lows, imposing negative rates on its overnight depositors to cajole banks into lending more and to fight off the risk of Japan-like deflation. The cut is the first time the ECB has deployed a negative deposit rate. "The rate cuts in Europe means more capital flowing into Poland - we are already seeing a stronger zloty as we speak," he said. "The Polish economy is more balanced than it was five or three years ago...we are not so not worried about the zloty. Looking forward it's something we need to keep an eye on." Szczurek and central bank Governor Marek Belka said on Wednesday that Poland should start discussion on how and when to adopt the euro after next year's parliamentary elections. Belka has previously said that Poland could bypass ERM-2, the waiting room for euro entry. Szczurek said he agreed with Belka: "It certainly doesn't look necessary."
