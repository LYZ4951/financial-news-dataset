June 5 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Stabilus S.A.'s (formerly Servus Holdco S.a.r.l.) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B' with a Positive Outlook. The remaining EUR256.1m senior secured notes issued by Servus Luxembourg Holding S.C.A [SLHS.UL] have been upgraded to 'BB-'/'RR2' from 'B+'/'RR3' based on improved recoveries. The ratings have been removed from Rating Watch Positive  (RWP) where they were placed on 30 April 2014.  The rating actions follow Stabilus's successful IPO on 23 May 2014 and the  reduction of debt by EUR58.9m. Fitch forecasts that funds from operations (FFO)  adjusted leverage will trend towards 4x by end of September 2014 (FY14), albeit  with interim debt fluctuations relating to short-term debt. The debt reduction  reduces interest expenses by approximately EUR4.5m per year, resulting in a  FFO/interest cover ratio above 3.0x (2015 forecast: 3.7x). At the same time,  public listing has further diversified the funding sources available to Stabilus  and enhanced its financial flexibility.  The Positive Outlook reflects the substantial reduction in debt following the  partial repayment of the bond, enhanced financial flexibility and expected FFO  interest cover of 3.7x for FY 2015. In addition, Stabilus continues to implement  its strategy of growth and further diversification with the Powerise segment  being an important contributor. The remaining senior secured notes also benefit  from improved recoveries following debt reduction. Stabilus's current  performance is in line with Fitch's expectations.KEY RATING DRIVERS  Deleveraging Through IPO  Fitch previously expected Stabilus's FFO adjusted leverage to remain near 4.5x  due to cash requirements related to the execution of the expansion strategy. The  IPO and debt reduction of EUR58.9m will reduce leverage to a level of around4x,  while enhancing financial flexibility. Discretionary cash flow should increase  due to lower interest payments.   Balanced, Resilient Profile Stabilus is the market leader in its main and commoditised product - gas springs  - with a significantly greater market share than its nearest competitors. As a  result, the company has considerable economies of scale and sound cash  generation. The ratings are further supported by Stabilus's broad mix of mature  and growth products in both automotive and industrial applications, with limited  customer concentration. This helps provide a buffer against the high demand  volatility and cyclicality that characterise the mature markets Stabilus  operates in. Given Stabilus's high fixed-cost base, a sustained decline in  demand would affect profitability and cash flow generation.   Competitive Threats Remain Stabilus has successfully positioned itself as a favoured supplier of automated,  electro-mechanical opening and closing systems, and has consequently become  increasingly important to OEMs' supply chains. However, Stabilus competes with  larger and more diversified suppliers, which Fitch expects will react to the  company's ambitious growth plans. In addition, this segment is likely to see  higher R&D and capex requirements, which will hold back the company's  deleveraging efforts.   Cash Flow Fluctuation  Stabilus has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) margins over the past four  years and during 1HFY14. However, capacity expansion efforts are likely to  remain a strong cash drain, although this should be mitigated by reduced  interest expenses following its IPO and debt repayment. As with most industrial  producers, Stabilus experiences seasonal working capital volatility. Outflows  are heaviest during the early part of the year. FCF generation could be further  restrained by dividend payments of 20%-40% of net income as planned in the new  dividend policy.  Sufficient Financial Flexibility Fitch views Stabilus's liquidity as adequate with sufficient financial  flexibility. Stabilus had EUR35m of cash on balance sheet at end-FY1H14,  although around EUR10m of this was for working capital needs and some of it is  restricted. The group has access to a EUR25m revolving credit facility (RCF).  Moreover, Stabilus has access to a EUR35m factoring programme, of which EUR20m  had been utilised in March 2014.   Strong Recoveries  The 'BB-' notes' Recovery Rating is 'RR2', reflecting above-average recoveries.  Recovery rates for the remaining creditors are expected to improve as a result  of debt reduction. The notching between the IDR and the instrument rating has  widened to two notches as a result of the debt reduction.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: The group focuses on three product lines (gas springs, Powerise and  swivel chairs) and its overall scale is limited compared with some other  automotive suppliers. Therefore, in addition to enhanced product and geographic  diversification, upgrades would require a substantial strengthening of key  credit ratios. We would view FFO adjusted leverage sustainably below 4.0x, FFO  interest cover sustainably above 3.5x and fixed charge cover sustainably above  3.0x as a pre-requisite.
