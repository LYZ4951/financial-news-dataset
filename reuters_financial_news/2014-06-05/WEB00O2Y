FRANKFURT, June 5 (Reuters) - FMS Wertmanagement, the bad bank winding down assets from nationalised German lender Hypo Real Estate, has sold a $1.2 billion U.S. commercial real estate loan portfolio, it said on Thursday.

FMS said in a statement it made the sale to take advantage of strong liquidity and heightened investor interest in the United States, adding that the portfolio consisted mostly of performing loans.
