CAIRO, June 5 (Reuters) - The gap between official and unofficial exchange rates of the Egyptian pound narrowed further on Thursday with the pound strengthening in the black market and remaining stable at a central bank auction.

Former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who toppled Egypt's first freely elected leader last July following mass protests, took more than 95 percent of the vote in presidential polls last week and joins a long line of leaders drawn from the military. On the black market, the dollar changed hands at a rate of 7.25/27 on Thursday, continuing to strengthen after the elections. Wednesday's rate of 7.35/38 pounds to the dollar compared with last week's rates of around 7.50 before Sisi's win was officially confirmed. Black market traders cited hopes of new investment and aid from Arab Gulf countries, who are public backers of Sisi, as a reason why demand had weakened. [ID:nL6N0OB0JG] The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1403 pounds <CBEO>, unchanged from its last sale on Wednesday. It had offered $40 million. Forex traders and economists have described the central bank's decision to allow the pound to gradually weaken since March as a managed depreciation. The central bank has not said why it has been letting the currency weaken. Business leaders have cited clarity on the direction of the currency as a condition for further investment.  The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars <EGP=> are determined by the results of the central bank sales <EGYTV>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. Egypt's foreign reserves fell to $17.284 billion at the end of May from $17.489 billion in April, the central bank said on Thursday. It had sold $1.1 billion at an exceptional forex auction on May 14. [ID:nL6N0O0395]
