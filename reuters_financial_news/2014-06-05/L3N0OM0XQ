BANGKOK, June 5 (Reuters) - Thai shares eked out slim gains on Thursday as optimism around the military government's policy boosted shares linked with domestic spending while stocks in the Philippines edged lower after higher-than-expected inflation in May.

Southeast Asian stock markets were broadly weak, in line with others in Asia <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on Thursday. [MKTS/GLOB] Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> was up 0.01 percent at midday. It fell to a three-day low earlier due to profit-taking in shares such as energy explorer PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK>. Shares of hotelier Minor International <MINT.BK> rose after curfew was lifted in some tourist towns. Shares of builder Italian Thai Development <ITD.BK> hit a six-month high as the army planned to push through infrastructure projects. The index is expected to move narrowly around 1,445-1,455 points, strategists at broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities said. The SET was at 1,449.4 at midday. The rally this week brought the SET's year-to-date gain to 11.6 percent, making it Asia's fifth-best performer, according to Thomson Reuters data. "Investors should closely watch the economic plans from the National Council of Peace and Order (NCPO)," they wrote in a report. Thailand's finance ministry plans to propose a revised state budget for the next fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and a deficit of 250 billion baht ($7.6 billion), similar to the current year's. [ID:nL3N0OL1ZV] The Philippine index <.PSI> eased 0.3 percent after an early  range-bound session. Data showed Philippine inflation quickened in May on costlier food and utilities, but the central bank is still seen keeping rates steady for now to support the economy. [ID:nL3N0OM0CF] Bucking the trend, shares of Bloomberry Resorts Corp <BLOOM.PS> gained as the leisure and gaming firm was in talks with a potential Japanese partner for what could be the company's maiden overseas venture.
