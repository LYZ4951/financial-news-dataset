BRUSSELS, June 5 (Reuters) - German Chancellor declined comment on Thursday on the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates to record lows, saying the bank took its decisions independently.

Merkel was asked about the ECB's move at a news conference after a meeting of Group of Seven leaders in Brussels.
