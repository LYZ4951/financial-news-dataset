PARIS, June 5 (Reuters) - European shares were steady early on Thursday, with indexes hovering below recent multi-year peaks ahead of a European Central Bank meeting that is expected to yield fresh measures to spur euro-zone growth.

At 0709 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.06 percent at 1,375.72 points, hovering just below a 6-1/2 year high hit earlier this week. At its meeting on Thursday, the ECB is expected to impose negative interest rates on its overnight depositors, seeking to prompt banks to lend instead and to prevent the region from slipping into Japan-like deflation, and launch a long-term refinancing operation (LTRO) targeted at businesses.
