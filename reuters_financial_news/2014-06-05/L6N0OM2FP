LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is examining data related to a global investigation into the possible manipulation of currency markets, but has yet to open a criminal investigation, it said on Thursday.

"The SFO is receiving and examining complex data on this topic. If and when we open a criminal investigation, that decision will be announced in the usual way," the agency's head David Green said in an emailed statement.
