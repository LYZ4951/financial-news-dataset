Oct 6 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co <HPQ.N> plans to separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers.

HP's printing and personal computing businesses account for about half the company's revenue and profit, according to its latest quarterly financial results. [ID:nL3N0S127C] The company's plan to split itself comes less than a week after eBay Inc <EBAY.O> said it planned to spin off PayPal, its lucrative payments business, by the end of 2015. [ID:nL3N0RV4DA] The separations could each rank among the biggest global spinoffs. HP has a market capitalization of about $66 billion and eBay has a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion.
