Oct 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will purchase 250 billion euros of euro-denominated covered bonds and simple, transparent asset-backed securities as it tries to raise euro zone inflation, a Reuters poll of traders forecast.

On Thursday, the ECB announced that these kinds of purchases would be made over at least two years. But it did not specify the amount it would buy. [ID:nF9N0OS01U] Ahead of that ECB meeting last week, euro money market traders had forecast 200 billion euros of total purchases in repackaged loans in a similar poll taken on September 29. ECB President Mario Draghi said that the central bank's balance sheet would move toward the dimension it was at in early 2012, roughly 3 trillion euros. Currently the ECB's balance sheet is around 2 trillion euros, and traders say the take-up of the new long-term loans (TLTROs) in December would be influential in how much the ECB buys of ABS and covered bonds. The ECB started offering TLTROs last month, which saw tepid demand from banks at the first tranche, just 82.6 billion euros, much less than expected.  "We have to be careful about the potential coming from TLTROs to increase the balance sheet. The less( take-up) there is from the TLTROs the more the ECB will have to do with the ABS and covered bonds." said a trader at a large dealer.  A separate Reuters poll of economists forecast that banks would bid for 175 billion euros at the TLTROs in December. [ID:nL3N0RP2YY] That take up would not reflect strong demand as more than 300 billion euros are still outstanding of the ECB's crisis loans from late 2011 and early 2012. Banks are expected to return another 3.1 billion euros of those crisis loans next week, more than the 2.3 billion euros they will repay this week.
