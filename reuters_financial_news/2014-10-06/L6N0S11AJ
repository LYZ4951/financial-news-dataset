LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), trying to fight back from a slump in its listed stocks and a management upheaval, wants to attract an overseas exchange such as Nasdaq <NDAQ.O> as a shareholder as part of a recovery plan, its chairman said.

TASE has replaced its two top executives in the past year and is trying to craft a fresh strategy involving a switch from being mutually owned to a for-profit organisation, seen as the route to reviving its fortunes. Chairman Amnon Neubach told Reuters TASE wants a foreign entity to take a stake in the company and has discussed the possibility with U.S. group Nasdaq, already established as a destination for many Israeli companies seeking a stock market listing. TASE may also pursue its own stock market listing. Neubach, in London for an event to promote the Israel economy in partnership with Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> derivatives exchange Eurex, said a meeting with Nasdaq had included the possibility of the U.S. exchange taking a 20 percent stake, as well as a cooperation deal. "The idea would be that a company will start (by listing) in Israel and then move directly to Nasdaq. That gives them a future and of course, dual trading in Israel and on Nasdaq." Nasdaq, which already operates a number of stock markets across northern Europe and London-based derivatives market NLX, declined comment. Neubach said TASE would also consider interest from other exchanges. Neubach, who has served on the boards of several public companies including Bezeq Israel Telecom <BEZQ.TA>, was an economic adviser to former prime minister and president Shimon Peres during the 1980s. [ID:nL6N0MH4Q8] He was appointed chairman of TASE in March, replacing long-time incumbent Saul Bronfeld who resigned last year after clashing with the head of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) over strategies to boost volumes. The number of companies listed on the TASE has shrunk to 474 from 654 since 2007, while average daily trading volume has fallen sharply in the past two years.  NEW MODEL  As part of a series of recommendations for reviving flagging trading volumes, the ISA suggested TASE become a for-profit bourse, saying this would help minimise conflicts of interest between TASE's management and market players. [ID:nL6N0MZ3F6] But Neubach said this was still at least a year away. TASE is currently owned by its members, mainly local and foreign investment banks. Neubach said the exchange was working on a model giving its  members, who hold voting rights but no equity, no more than a 5 percent holding. Legislation would have to be modified accordingly, which will take time. "(The plans) are in a very advanced position. I hope ... that about 12 or 15 months from today everything will be closed. Because of legislation ... we cannot say that it will be sooner," he said. Chief Executive Yossi Beinart - himself a relatively recent recruit following the same shakeout that led to Neubach's appointment - in May set out a revival strategy involving recruiting a sales team to help promote its services and allowing trading of companies not listed on the exchange. [ID:nL6N0NZ31Q]   Beinart is aiming to lure 100 companies to TASE in the next five years and generate volume of 2.5 billion shekels ($681.5 million) a day.  He has also proposed changing TASE's trading week to Monday to Friday, rather than Sunday through Thursday, to align more with global markets. [ID:nL5N0QV24V] TASE is speaking to stakeholders to assess the consequences on staffing, logistics and other issues, Neubach said. "As of today I have heard very few objections and most people have been supportive because they believe it will be beneficial to work on the same days as the European and American markets."
