PARIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - European shares rose early on Monday, adding to the previous session's rebound in the wake of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs figures which sparked a rally in stock markets worldwide.

German equities were leading the gains, with the DAX index <.GDAXI> up 1.3 percent. The Frankfurt bourse, closed on Friday for a public holiday, was catching up with the rebound in stocks in Europe. At 0708 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.5 percent at 1,354.11 points in a broad-based rally. Shares in exporters such as Airbus <AIR.PA> featured among the top gainers, getting a lift from the euro's further slide following U.S. jobs data. Airbus was up 1.1 percent while Daimler <DAIGn.DE> was up 1.9 percent.
