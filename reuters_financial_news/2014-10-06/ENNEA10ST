MACAU, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gambling revenue in the world's biggest gambling hub Macau fell 11.7 percent in September on an annual basis, the fourth consecutive monthly decline this year, as Beijing's campaign against corruption and falling housing prices in China sapped demand from big-spending customers.

Gambling revenue from Macau's 35 casinos fell to 25.6 billion patacas (3.21 billion US dollar) in September from 29 billion patacas a year earlier, according to data released by the Macau government on Monday. Analysts were expecting a decline of 13-15 percent.
