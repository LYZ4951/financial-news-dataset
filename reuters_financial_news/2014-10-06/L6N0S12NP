TIRANA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Albania's economy contracted 0.6 percent in the second quarter versus the same quarter last year, denting government hopes for a 2.1 percent expansion in gross domestic product this year.

Gjergj Filipi, head of the Institute of Statistics, said the figure was weak due to the second quarter last year being the strongest since 2009 thanks to high public investment ahead of parliamentary elections. Compared with the first quarter of the year, GDP rose 0.4 percent in April-June, the Institute said. In the first quarter, GDP grew 1.7 percent on a year-on-year basis. "The economy is growing from one quarter to the next. The Albanian economy is stabilizing, with modest rates of growth, but it is stabilizing," Filipi said. Construction, transport and manufacturing activity fell by 22 percent, 23 percent and 1.3 percent respectively in the second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. "This is no surprise for us because the second quarter of 2013 was unusual in its intensity," Filipi told reporters.
