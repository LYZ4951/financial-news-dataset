HANOI, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rallied 0.51 percent at Monday's break, led by the property sector after news that real estate developer Vingroup <VIC.HM> may own a majority of shares in a supermarket operator.

The Hanoi-based firm Vingroup has agreed to buy 21 million shares, or 70 percent, of Ocean Retail Co, a subsidiary of the Ocean Group <OGC.HM>, from the latter group, Vingroup said in a filing to the exchange late last Friday. The shares are worth 210 billion dong ($9.9 million) at face value, the document said, without giving the actual value of the deal. OGC shares jumped 4.58 percent, having touched an intraday high level of more than six months in early trade, while VIC climbed 3 percent to 51,500 dong, Reuters data showed. Funds also flowed into oil and gas shares, betting on the sector's positive results this year, said deputy manager Nguyen Tuan of An Binh Securities. Petrovietnam Drilling & Well Services Corp <PVD.HM> advanced 1 percent, after ending near its one-month low on Sept. 29, while Petrovietnam Transportation Corp <PVT.HM> increased 1.69 percent. Both firms are subsidiary of state oil and gas group PetroVietnam. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).  VN Index   614.66 PREV.
