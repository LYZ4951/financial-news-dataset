FRANKFURT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> performed well in the third quarter, especially in retail and investment banking, helping it shoulder the burden of charges for legal and regulatory issues, two financial sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The bank has positioned itself as Europe's "last man standing" in investment banking after rivals like Barclays <BARC.L> slashed operations. "Real money is being earned once again," said one of sources. Both sources declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Deutsche Bank, which is scheduled to release its quarterly results on Oct. 29, declined to comment. Germany's largest lender is striving to settle a number of probes before year-end, including those involving U.S. mortgage-backed bonds and the attempted manipulation benchmark interest rates, the sources said. Deutsche also aims to conclude settlement talks with U.S. authorities before year-end over dealings with blacklisted countries such as Iran, the sources said. [ID:nL6N0RV3IX] The bank's net result in the quarter will be burdened by charges for legal and regulatory settlements, although an improving operating performance will help the bank to shoulder those costs, the sources said. Whether the bank books its legal or settlement costs in the third quarter or the fourth - or whether the costs will be paid down next year - depends more on the actions of regulators than on a decision by the bank, the bank has said publicly.  Any conclusion in investigations into possible attempts to manipulate foreign exchange benchmarks is unlikely in 2014, and Deutsche Bank is not interested in an industry-wide settlement, the sources said. [ID:nL1N0MT1HV] Deutsche Bank launched a reform plan in 2012 to boost compliance functions after getting hit by a wave of post-financial crisis investigations.
