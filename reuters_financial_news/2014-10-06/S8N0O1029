DUBLIN, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Ireland's lenders are taking too long to deal with loan arrears and the delays are interfering with government efforts to sell off bank stakes nationalised during the financial crisis, Central Bank Governor Patrick Honohan said on Monday.

"Perceptible progress in dealing with arrears is now undeniable.  But it is still too slow," Honohan said in a speech to students in Dublin. [ID:nL6N0RY2JL]
