LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Britain's Pension Protection Fund (PPF) cut the estimated levy it charges UK defined benefit - final salary - pension schemes by about 10 percent to 635 million pounds ($1.01 billion) for 2015/16 from a year ago period, it said on Monday.

"While the future is inevitably uncertain, levy estimates for the following two years appear likely to fall further rather than rise, based on the expected path of asset values and yields," Alan Rubenstein, chief executive officer of the PPF said in a statement.
