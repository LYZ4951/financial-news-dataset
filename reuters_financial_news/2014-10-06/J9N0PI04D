JAKARTA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves were unchanged at $111.2 billion by the end of September compared to the previous month, Bank Indonesia said on Monday.

Foreign exchange reserves were "relatively stable from the previous month," Bank Indonesia spokesman Tirta Segara said in a statement. Foreign reserves were supported by global Islamic bonds issuance, oil and gas export revenue and an increase in bank forex deposits to the central bank .
