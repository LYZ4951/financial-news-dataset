WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The United States on Monday exempted Turkey's Denizbank <DENIZ.IS> from broader U.S. sanctions on the Russian financial industry, allowing the Turkish lender to continue accessing U.S. debt markets despite its Russian ownership.

Denizbank is owned by Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's largest bank by assets, which became subject to U.S. sanctions last month, triggered by what the West sees as Moscow's interference in eastern Ukraine.
