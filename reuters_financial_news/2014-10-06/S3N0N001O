STOCKHOLM, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Sweden's coalition government of the Social Democrats and Greens and the opposition Left Party said on Monday they had reached an agreement to significantly limit profit-taking by private players in the Nordic country's welfare sector.

Reaching agreement on the issue was a key demand for the Left Party to lend support the minority government's budget bill due later this year. "We need to put our welfare sector in order and that is what we aim to make sure happens," Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told a news conference, adding the new regulations would be included in the budget bill.
