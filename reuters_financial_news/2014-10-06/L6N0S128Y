LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Brazilian debt insurance costs fell 19 basis points on Monday and the average premium carried by its dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries narrowed by 15 bps after weekend elections saw surprise gains for pro-business candidate Aecio Neves.

Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) touched 1-1/2 week lows of 157 bps, according to Markit while sovereign debt spreads  narrowed to 199 bps over u.s. Treasuries on the EMBI Global index <11EML>, the lowest since end-April 2013. Brazil's dollar bond maturing in 2045 almost half a cent to 96.79 <105756BW9=>. Neves, a former two-term state governor and senator who had been widely written off until the last few days of the campaign, rode a late surge in support to second place with 33.6 percent support in Sunday's first round of voting. He will face incumbent Dilma Rousseff, who won 41.6 percent support, in the runoff on Oct. 26. "Neves' strong pro-business stance would likely be welcomed by investors, giving Brazilian companies the reform and support they badly need, and that they have lacked for some time," said Anna Stupnytska, Global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investments. "If Neves wins, this could put Brazil on the path to real structural reform," she added.
