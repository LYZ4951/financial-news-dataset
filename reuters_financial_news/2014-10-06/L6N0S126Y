JERUSALEM, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Rafi Melnick, one of the six voting members of the Bank of Israel's monetary policy committee, ended his three-year term on Monday, the central bank said, and it was not immediately clear who would replace him.

Melnick, also provost at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Institute think tank, was one of the three external MPC members. A central bank spokesman said a special search committee has yet to recommend to the government any successor and as a result, the MPC would be comprised of five members starting with the upcoming interest rate decision on Oct. 27. After heavy lobbying from former central bank chief Stanley Fischer, Israel introduced a rate-setting committee in 2010 after decades in which the governor alone took rate decisions.
