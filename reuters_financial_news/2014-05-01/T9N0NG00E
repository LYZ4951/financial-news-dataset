TOKYO, May 1 (Reuters) - Shares in Nomura Holdings <8604.T> climbed 4.6 percent to 615 yen on Thursday, bouncing off a 13-month low touched on the previous day, after its fourth-quarter net profit came in at 61.3 billion yen ($600 million), beating market estimates of 41 billion yen.

Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage, also said after the market close on Wednesday that it would repurchase 100 million shares, or 2.6 percent of its outstanding stock, with 44 million of that set aside for those exercising stock options, or rights to buy shares. [ID:nL3N0NK38Q]
