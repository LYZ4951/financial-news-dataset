LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - British fund manager Schroders  <SDR.L> said assets under management rose to a record 268 billion pounds ($452.53 billion) in the first quarter of 2014 after it took in new money across a range of products.

Those new wins - which totalled 3.8 billion pounds across multi-asset, equities and fixed income - meant the year had started well, Chief Executive Michael Dobson said, although uncertainty in financial markets meant retail investor demand could take a hit in the short term.
