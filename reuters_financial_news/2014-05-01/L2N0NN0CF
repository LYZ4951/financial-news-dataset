May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp <CI.N> said on Thursday that its first-quarter profit rose as revenue increased, medical customers grew and it managed medical costs of its commercial and Medicare customers.

Cigna reported net income of $528 million, or $1.92 per share, up from $57 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier, when it took a charge for exiting a business. The company reported earnings of $1.83 per share, excluding investment gains.
