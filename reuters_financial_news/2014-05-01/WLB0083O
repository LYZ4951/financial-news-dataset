LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> plans to sell off at least 25 percent of its TSB business in a stock market flotation before the end of June, Finance Director George Culmer told reporters on a conference call.

Lloyds must sell the business, valued by analysts at around 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), as a condition of its 20.5 billion pound bailout during the 2008/9 business.
