NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Apr 30 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $11.2 billion to $1.032 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $9.9 billion to $1.067 trillion.
