May 1 (Reuters) - Since the financial crisis began nearly seven years ago, policymakers and regulators have been trying create a safer global banking system to ensure that taxpayers will not have to pick up the bill in the future when a bank gets into trouble. They are also involved in investigating a whole range of misdemeanours in financial markets from mis-selling of consumer financial products to rigging of benchmark interest rates.

Top regulators are speaking exclusively to Reuters at this week's summit to give their views on the regulatory landscape and where financial rule-making is going next.
