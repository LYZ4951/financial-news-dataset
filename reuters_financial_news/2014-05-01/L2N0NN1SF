May 1 (Reuters) - The most unusual activity in the stock market on Thursday was in an exchange-traded fund tied to bonds, where volume exploded.

More than 21.8 million shares in the iShares 7-10 Year Bond ETF <IEF.P> changed hands on Thursday, the heaviest trading day for that ETF in its history. The ETF didn't move much, gaining just 29 cents to $102.41, but it's the volume that was particularly unusual - the day's activity amounts to 2,343 percent of the average day over the past 90 days.  This may reflect investors getting ready for the jobs report on Friday, and also may be the result of big short positions in 10-year futures that have built up over time and are yet to be shed even as the 10-year note yield continues to drop. Two weeks ago investors were net short 162,278 10-year contracts, the most since early January, in anticipation of higher rates.  That hasn't happened, and so those short positions are losing money. Other notable bond ETFs, like the iShares 20-year-plus Treasury Bond ETF <TLT.P>, saw heavy volume as well.From earlier in the day: 16:10 - U.S. equity averages ended the day close to unchanged on Thursday, as some of the trading-crowd favorites rebounded from recent losses while cyclical sectors like energy and materials stocks finished lower.  The market muddled through a session sandwiched between the Federal Reserve's relatively uneventful Wednesday meeting and Friday's scheduled nonfarm payrolls report. Strong manufacturing figures and consumer spending data has given some hope that payrolls figures will confirm a pickup in economic activity after the weak first quarter of growth. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 22.03 points or 0.13 percent, to 16,558.81, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.28 points or 0.01 percent, to 1,883.67 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 12.896 points or 0.31 percent, to 4,127.451. Avon Products <AVP.N> was the worst performer on the S&P today, losing 10 percent, while CBRE Group Inc <CBG.N> rose 8.8 percent as the day's biggest gainer.

The move makes the sector as the best performing on Thursday, and puts it on track to post its sixth consecutive week of gains. Exelon <EXC.N> is leading utilities less than an hour away from the closing bell, up 2.5 percent on the day. It's almost recouped the 3.2 percent loss posted Wednesday after it said it would buy Pepco <POM.N> to become the top U.S. power distributor.
