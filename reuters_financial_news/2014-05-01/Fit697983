May 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch: Detroit's Treatment of Bondholders Strains  Boundaries of Creditor Expectations   While Detroit's agreement with bond insurers treats the unlimited tax general  obligation (ULTGO) bonds closer to Fitch's expectations than those the city  proposed, bankruptcy treatment of the utility bonds and the city's suit to  invalidate certificates of participation (COPs) challenge traditional rating  distinctions linked to bondholder security,. according to a new Fitch Ratings  report. 'Most Detroit bondholders are left vulnerable. If special revenue bondholders  are impaired as proposed, or the city's suit to invalidate the COPs is  successful, there could be a roadmap for a legal strategy in a limited number of  other cases,' said Amy Laskey, Managing Director, U.S. Public Finance.  The agreement on the ULTGO bonds stipulates even more substantial impairment for  LTGO bondholders. Holders of pension certificates of obligation may get a very  low recovery at best. Even bonds secured by 'special revenues' may be at risk.  Maintaining or restoring essential services should be expected to trump  attention to security distinctions when a municipality is distressed to the  point of bankruptcy. Rating distinct security structures at levels without any  direct linkage to the ULTGO debt will make sense only when that security  reflects impregnable legal protection.  It remains to be seen whether special revenue status, which could include a  statutory lien on dedicated tax revenues, affords that kind of protection. The  proposed impairment of the utility debt in the PPOA suggests it may not.  The city is challenging the validity of the COPs it issued to provide funding  for pension plans in the mid-2000s. Should the city prevail, the decision will  suggest a legal theory to attack certain other nontraditional securities used by  municipalities in order to avoid adherence to legal requirements related to debt  issuance. Fitch believes most of the commonly used structures are better  positioned to survive such a claim.
