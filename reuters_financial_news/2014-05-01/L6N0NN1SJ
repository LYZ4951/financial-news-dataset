LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - An incident which resulted in a controlled explosion in the London financial district of Canary Wharf was "non-suspicious" and the area would return to normal soon following a security alert, a London police spokesman told Reuters on Thursday.

Earlier a suspect package was found near the Barclays <BARC.L> headquarters, a Canary Wharf security official said.
