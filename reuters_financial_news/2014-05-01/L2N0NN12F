WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday a complex type of swaps known as "package transaction" must be traded on regulated platforms in the coming months, pursuant to a phased compliance timeline.

Swaps have started trading on these platforms - known as Swap Execution Facilities - this year as the agency's rules for the $690 trillion global swaps market start coming into effect after the financial crisis.
