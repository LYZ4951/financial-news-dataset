LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays Plc <BARC.L> said it had poached a senior banker from Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) <CBA.AX> to fill its vacant post to head operations and technology.

Barclays on Thursday said Michael Harte, executive of enterprise services and chief information officer at CBA, would become its operations and technology officer, filling a role left by Shaygan Kheradpir, who resigned in November to become chief executive of Juniper Networks <JNPR.N>.
