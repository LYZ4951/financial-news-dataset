Chief Executive Officer Thomas Borgen spoke with Reuters:  ABOUT THE DANISH ECONOMY "The limited growth in the Danish economy means the top line in particular will have some challenges to growth, and that's why it's crucial for us to continue to be diligent on costs and continue to develop alternative products and solutions for clients."  ABOUT DANISH MARKET SHARE "In Denmark we are a market leader with a market share of plus/minus 30 percent. We are very comfortable with that market share. We do not see a need to grow it but there are lots of products we can continue to develop for the Danish market. In addition we have a very good platform in Norway and Sweden where we can see great growth opportunities."   ABOUT BUSINESS IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN "We are fully committed to Norway and Sweden. We are doing a strategic review; however it is not a question of downsizing Norway or Sweden."  ABOUT CRIMEA CONFLICT
