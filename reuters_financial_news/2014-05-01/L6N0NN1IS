LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Northill Capital, the independent asset manager backed by the Bertarelli family, said on Thursday it had acquired a majority stake in fellow independent asset manager Longview Partners.

After the deal, Northill will control 55 percent of global equities-focused Longview, which manages $19.5 billion on behalf of mostly institutional clients, it said in a statement. The deal is the largest to date for Northill, founded in 2011 by Jon Little, former vice-chairman of BNY Mellon Asset Management, with the aim of build a portfolio of high quality specialist asset managers. Northill received financial backing at launch from the Bertarelli family, which led the pharmaceutical business Serono before it was bought by Merck <MRCG.DE> in 2006.
