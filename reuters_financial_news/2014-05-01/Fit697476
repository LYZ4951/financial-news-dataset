May 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed El Paso de Robles,  California's (the city) outstanding obligations as follows: --$28.6 million general obligation (GO) bonds at 'AA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  SECURITY  The bonds are general obligations of the city, payable from unlimited ad valorem  taxes levied within the city.  KEY RATING DRIVERS STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH RECESSION: The city's solid financial  position has shown consistent growth following the economic downturn. City  finances benefit from conservative budgeting, proactive financial planning,  active expenditure management and the recent adoption by voters of a temporary  half-cent sales tax. ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE REVENUE PROFILE: Solid reserve levels mitigate concerns  to some degree regarding the general fund's dependence on sales and transient  occupancy taxes, which are derived from a fairly narrow economic base.  LIMITED LOCAL ECONOMY: Local economy is largely centered on wine production and  tourism, with a growing presence of biotechnology and software engineering  concerns. Wealth levels and unemployment are comparable to the national  averages. POSITIVE DEBT PROFILE: Overall debt levels are low and amortization is rapid.  There are no near-term plans for debt issuance and the recent passage of a  dedicated half-cent sales tax is expected to help the city address its capital  needs. Pension costs will likely rise over the next several years, subject to  future state legislative action, to address unfunded liabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit characteristics  including the city's strong financial management practices. The Stable Outlook  reflects Fitch's expectation that such shifts are unlikely.  CREDIT PROFILE The city is located in San Luis Obispo County (implied GO rating of 'AAA';  Stable Outlook) about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, about 15  miles from the coast. The city's population as of 2013 was 30,556.  STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND MANAGEMENT The city has demonstrated consistently strong financial performance, due largely  to active expenditure management and conservative budgeting and planning. The  city was able to manage costs well during the recession through the elimination  of discretionary spending and the reduction of general fund full time equivalent  staffing by 35% through frozen positions and retirement incentives. As a result,  the city was able to close a structural imbalance in fiscal year 2011 that was  created in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The city has been adding back positions  in the time since. The city is projected to finish fiscal year 2014 with a modest operating surplus  after transfers. Four consecutive fiscal years of surpluses, in addition to a  fund balance reclassification in fiscal year 2011, are projected to bring total  general fund balance to a very strong $17.1 million, or 65.2% of spending, in  fiscal year 2014 from $10.7 million, or 40.7% of spending, in fiscal year 2011.  The preliminary fiscal year 2015 budget shows another modest surplus and the  city's five year forecast shows continued structural balance. Fitch considers  the city's projections to be reasonable given conservative assumptions for the  city's collection of sales and transient occupancy tax revenues and a recently  passed half-cent sales tax measure that will relieve some pent-up capital  spending pressures on the general fund.  FINANACIAL STRENGTH OFFSETS REVENUE VOLATILITY CONCERNS The city's sound reserves and policy's regarding the maintenance of these  reserves reduce concerns regarding the city's significant degree of reliance on  economically sensitive revenues. Sales tax revenue and transient occupancy tax  revenue account for 29% and 13%, respectively, of fiscal year 2013 general fund  revenues. Property taxes, which Fitch views as an inherently more stable revenue  source, accounted for a somewhat low 27.7% of the general fund revenue base.  Sales and property tax revenue both saw declines related to the recession;  however, both revenue sources have nearly fully recovered to peak levels as of  fiscal year 2013. Transient occupancy tax collections, which are typically very  economically sensitive, proved to be a resilient revenue source during this past  recession. Management's informal policy is to maintain no less than 25% of spending in  general fund balance. Reserves have remained well above this level and  management does not anticipate a reduction in general fund reserves over the  near term.  AVERAGE ECONOMIC PROFILE The city's local economy is mainly based on wine production and tourism, with a  growing presence of higher-paying software engineering and biotechnology  concerns. Tourism continues to grow, as evidenced by year-over-year increases in  sales and transient occupancy tax collections and the on-going construction of  7-8 new high-end hotels within city limits. The city also participates in the  broad and diverse San Luis Obispo county regional economy with a large state  government and utility presence. Unemployment has trended above the national rate but below the state's high rate  since the economic downturn. The December 2013 unemployment rate decreased to  6.7% from 8.6% in the prior year, as employment growth outpaced a mild labor  force contraction. Wealth indicators are generally at or below regional and  national averages. The city's 2013 population of 30,556 has grown by an above-average annual rate  of 2.1% over the past decade, but Fitch does not detect signs of related capital  pressures. Taxable assessed valuation (TAV) posted solid growth in fiscal year  2014 and has nearly returned to its prerecession peak. The housing market has  also posted decent recovery.  FAVORABLE DEBT POSITION Overall debt levels are low at $2,028 on a per capita basis and 1.7% of TAV.  Amortization is above average, with nearly 65% of principal retired within 10  years. The city's capital needs are minimal and are nearly completely funded by  grants, gas tax revenue, and the revenue generated by the new half-cent sales  tax. The city does not anticipate issuing further debt over at least the near  term.
