KUWAIT, May 1 (Reuters) - Michel Accad has been appointed chief executive of Kuwait's Al Ahli Bank <ABKK.KW>, a stock market statement said on Thursday, the latest in a series of senior management changes at Kuwaiti lenders.

Accad joins Ahli, a medium-sized lender, from Kuwait's Gulf Bank <GBKK.KW> where he resigned as CEO last year. He was replaced by Spanish banker Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno. [ID:nL6N0MF2EU] Two other large Kuwaiti banks have had changes in top management recently.
