May 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the Country  Ceiling of 'BBB-' on the two sub regions of the franc zone, Union Economique et  Monetaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) and Communaute Economique et Monetaire  d'Afrique Centrale (CEMAC) reflects the benefits derived from their monetary  arrangement with France (AA+/ Stable). The Country Ceiling is markedly higher  than the sovereign ratings of rated member countries - Gabon (BB-), Cameroon (B)  and the Republic of Congo (B+). Under the monetary arrangement France guarantees full convertibility of the CFA  franc at a fixed rate with the euro. This rules out the risk of a  balance-of-payments crisis and is a key external strength.  The monetary arrangement has supported macro stability in the form of low  inflation, stable currency and budget discipline (due to an inability to  monetise budget deficits). Had franc zone countries not been linked to a strong  currency at times of recurrent political crisis (as in Cote d'Ivoire in 2011 or  Mali in 2012), instability would have been aggravated by sharp depreciation of  the currency, high inflation and increased dollarisation.  Foreign-exchange (FX) reserves have remained close to 100% of the monetary base  in recent years, due to abundant oil-related FX inflows in CEMAC and debt  cancellation, which has taken the form of retrocession of funds in foreign  currency in UEMOA. If needed, the French Treasury would provide external  liquidity through an unlimited overdraft on the central banks' account. However,  an unsustainable drain on FX would likely trigger adjustment measures, as in  1994 when the currency was devalued by 50%. GDP growth compares well with African peers'. Non-oil growth performance in the  franc zone (5.5%) has been slightly below that of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)  (6.2%) over the last decade. Growth was lower in UEMOA (4%) than in CEMAC (7.1%)  where oil receipts have financed vast infrastructure projects in countries such  as Gabon and the Republic of Congo. Public debt is moderate, at 30% of GDP on average. Almost all franc zone  countries (except oil-rich Gabon and Equatorial Guinea) have benefited from  external debt forgiveness from official creditors. Despite the involvement of  the IMF and other development partners, public finance management is weak.  Financing in UEMOA relies heavily on development aid and in CEMAC on  commodities. The tax take is low and government arrears are high. Weak public  finances are a key factor explaining the large gap between these countries'  sovereign ratings and the Country Ceiling.  Structural indicators are also generally weak. The franc zone comprises  countries with the lowest income per capita in the world. Their economies are  undiversified, based on agriculture or commodity exports, which make them  vulnerable to commodity price changes. The region is marred by political  instability, as recently illustrated by the crisis in the Central African  Republic (CAR). World Bank governance indicators and doing business indicators  are well below the 'B' median.  Stronger economic development is hampered by the lack of efficient public  services, infrastructure (eg, paved roads, electricity) and limited economic  integration. The main barriers are tariffs (for certain goods), lengthy border  controls and road blocks. The two sub-regional currencies are not convertible  between each other. Financial depth is among the lowest in the world.  Controls and delays on capital transfers between the sub-regions and the rest of  the world are a key factor explaining the eight-notch difference between the  Country Ceiling of the franc zone and the sovereign rating of the ultimate  guarantor, France. Capital flows are free within each sub-region, as illustrated  by the recent development of a regional local-currency debt market in UEMOA. A change in the monetary arrangement with France would prompt a review of the  Country Ceiling. A change of several notches in France's rating could also  affect the Country Ceiling. Fitch would not expect any development at member  country level to lead to an improvement in the Country Ceiling, which is already  high relative to sovereign ratings in the zone.
