DUBAI, May 1 (Reuters) - All markets in the Gulf edged up on Thursday, led by Saudi Arabia which rose to a six-year high on the back of petrochemicals and cement makers.

The kingdom's main index <.TASI> gained 0.8 percent to 9,660 points, its highest close since June 2008. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) <2010.SE>, up 2.6 percent, was the main support, also topping daily turnover.

Shares in Saudi Public Transport Co (Saptco) <4040.SE> jumped 2.8 percent after the company, together with a French partner, won a 7.86 billion riyal ($2.1 billion) contract to operate and maintain buses in Riyadh. [ID:nL6N0NN1CT] In Qatar, the index <.QSI> added 0.4 percent. Industries Qatar <IQCD.QS> rose 2.5 percent, recovering further after a sell-off earlier this week which was triggered by a 38 percent drop in first-quarter net profit. However, overall trading volume in Qatar roughly halved.
