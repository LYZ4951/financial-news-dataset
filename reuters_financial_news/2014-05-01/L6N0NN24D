LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - BC Partners [BCPRT.UL] is selling a 7.8 percent stake in UK estate agents Foxtons <FOXT.L> via an accelerated bookbuild for at least 3.10 pounds ($5.23) a share, two sources said on Thursday.

Foxtons currently has a market capitalization of 895.22 million pounds. A price of 3.10 pounds per share would value the stake at 70 million pounds. Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> and Numis <NUM.L> are running the share sale, one of the sources said. BC Partners began exiting Foxtons through an initial public offering in 2013.
