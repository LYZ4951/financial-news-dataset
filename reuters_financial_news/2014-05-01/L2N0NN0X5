WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange <ICE.N> and several of its affiliates will pay a $4.5 million penalty to settle civil charges over what U.S. regulators say were repeated failures to comply with exchange rules and federal laws.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said that NYSE engaged in a series of different business practices that either violated rules or were conducted without having a rule in place to permit such activity.
