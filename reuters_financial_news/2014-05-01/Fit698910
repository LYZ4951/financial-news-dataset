May 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Bank of  Queensland Limited's <BOQ.AX> (BOQ, BBB+/Stable/F2) REDS Warehouse Trust No.1  mortgage-backed floating-rate notes as follows:  AUD354.5m Class A notes affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; and AUD18.0m Class B notes affirmed at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable. The notes are issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as  trustee of REDS Warehouse Trust No.1.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating actions reflect Fitch's view that available credit enhancement  supports the notes at their current rating levels, the agency's expectations of  Australia's economic conditions, and that the credit quality and performance of  the underlying loans have remained in line with the agency's expectations.  As at end-February 2014, the collateral pool consisted of 1,487 loans with a  total portfolio balance of AUD367.7m, with a weighted average loan-to-valuation  ratio of 49.3%, and a weighted average seasoning of 40.6 months. Reduced  documentation loans make up 2.9% of the transaction. The trust's current  facility limit is AUD500m. Lenders mortgage insurance (LMI) covers 100% of the  pool, with 93.1% provided by QBE Lenders' Mortgage Insurance Limited and the  remaining 6.9% provided by Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Unexpected increases in delinquencies, defaults and losses would be necessary  before any negative rating action would be considered.
