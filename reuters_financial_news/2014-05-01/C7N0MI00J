COPENHAGEN, May 1 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> reported first-quarter pretax profit above forecast on Thursday and raised its full-year profit guidance thanks to cost cuts and lower writedowns on loans.

Denmark's largest lender said that pretax profit rose 64 percent to 3.63 billion Danish crowns ($674.3 million), beating a forecast of 3.5 billion crowns.
