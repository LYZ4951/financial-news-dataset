SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Australia's top investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd <MQG.AX> posted a 56 percent rise in half yearly profits on Friday, boosted by a strong performance by its market-facing business.

Net profit of A$764 million ($710 million) for the six months to March 31, was slightly above analysts' consensus forecast of A$720 million and up from A$490 million a year ago.
