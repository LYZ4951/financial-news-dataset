FRANKFURT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> is in talks with private equity companies Apollo and Cerberus [CBS.UL] to sell a 4 billion euro ($5.4 billion) portfolio of Spanish property loans, German weekly magazine WirtschaftsWoche reported.

Commerzbank, Germany's second-largest lender, declined to comment. Apollo and Cerberus could not immediately be reached. The Frankfurt-based bank is seeking to sell off the portfolios of its former mortgage unit Hypothekenbank Frankfurt International, formerly known as Eurohypo to cut its balance sheet and fulfil stricter bank safety rules known as Basel III.
