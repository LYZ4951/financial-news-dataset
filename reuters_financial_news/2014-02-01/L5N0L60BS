FRANKFURT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's <DBKGn.DE> fund management unit DWS is growing impatient with German airline Lufthansa's <LHAG.DE> delay in appointing a new chief executive, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said.

Henning Gebhardt, a fund manager at DWS, told the paper Lufthansa was taking too long to appoint a successor to Christoph Franz who said in September he would leave to join Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche <ROG.VX>.
