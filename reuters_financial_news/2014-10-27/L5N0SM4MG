LISBON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Millennium bcp <BCP.LS>, Portugal's largest listed bank, should be breaking even by the end of this year after a long period of losses, its chief executive said on Monday.

"There is a consistent positive trend, quarter after quarter. We are confident that at the end of the year we will reach the break-even point," Nuno Amado told reporters. Millennium bcp said on Sunday it had dramatically reduced its nine-month net loss to 98 million euros from 597 million euros a year earlier, with net interest income rising 29 percent to 791 million euros. BCP failed the industrywide health checks  on Europe's banks but these looked at the state of their balance sheets at the end of 2013 and Millenium said it did not need to raise new capital or sell strategic assets as a result.
