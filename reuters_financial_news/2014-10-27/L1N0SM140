NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Hess Corp. <HES.N> agreed to sell its stake in Hess Energy Trading, also known as HETCO, to an affiliate of funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity firm, according to a statement Monday.

Oaktree will provide working capital to HETCO and has committed up to $500 million of additional capital for HETCO to make potential new investments in the commodity space, according to the statement. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. Hess has been shedding assets since 2013, when activist shareholders including Elliott Management forced a reorganization of the board. The venture changes hands as the landscape of commodities trading is shifting away from large banks, which are divesting physical commodity holdings, toward independent commodity merchants like Mercuria and Trafigura.  Hetco is a joint venture between Hess, which holds a 50 percent stake, and former Goldman Sachs <GS.N> partners Stephen Hendel and Stephen Semlitz.
