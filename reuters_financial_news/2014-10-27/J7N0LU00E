JERUSALEM, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel left its benchmark interest rate <ILINR=ECI> at 0.25 percent for a second straight month on Monday after signs of slight economic improvement reduced the immediate need for a rate cut.

Eight of 12 economists polled by Reuters had forecast no move, with four others predicting a rate reduction of 0.1-0.15 percentage point. The central bank lowered its key rate by a combined half-point in July and August. Hurt partly by a summer war with Palestinian militants in Gaza, Israel's economy is expected to slow to a growth rate of around 2.2 percent in 2014 from 3.2 percent in 2013. The economy grew an annualised 1.9 percent in the second quarter, revised up from a prior estimate of 1.5 percent while other data showed improvement.
