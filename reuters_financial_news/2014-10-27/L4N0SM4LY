Oct 27 (Reuters) - Banks will borrow 175 billion euros from the European Central Bank in the second tranche of cheap loans due in December, leaving a third of the available cash untapped, according to a Reuters poll of euro money market traders.

Demand for the December operation is expected to be stronger than the first one in September when banks took just 82.6 billion euros, much less than expected, and a fraction of the more than 1 trillion euros banks took up in two similar loans in late 2011 and early 2012. The difference is that those had no strings attached whereas the latest loans are tied to banks actually lending the money to businesses. But with about 300 billion euros of the old crisis loans still outstanding, some of that is expected to be rolled over to the new ECB loan facility before they mature in January and February. That suggests the various policy steps the ECB has taken so far won't boost bank lending and get inflation back to the 2 percent target ceiling, leaving them few other options other than buying sovereign bonds. Many traders in polls taken in September said the take up in December - which they also then put at 175 billion euros - would depend on the results of the ECB's Asset Quality Review (AQR). The ECB said very few banks were under-capitalised and the results of the AQR were more positive than expected, although some traders said it would not help the central bank in expanding its balance sheet. [ID:nL5N0SL1PA] When asked if the results would make it easier for the ECB to expand its balance sheet in the coming year, 11 of 18 traders said 'yes', while the remaining seven said 'no'. The regular survey showed the ECB is expected to allot 95 billion euros in the regular weekly tender and 7 billion euros in the three-month operation. Banks took 92.92 billion euros at last week's tender and 6.7862 billion euros in July.
