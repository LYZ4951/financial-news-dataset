LISBON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Portugal's Banco BPI <BBPI.LS> sees the potential for "a large increase in efficiency" from the possible acquisition of Novo Banco, which was carved out of Banco Espirito Santo after a state rescue in August, BPI chief executive said on Monday.

Fernando Ulrich reiterated in a news briefing that his bank - Portugal's second-largest listed lender - is considering the opportunity of buying Novo Banco and is eagerly awaiting the release of its starting balance sheet and auditing results. [ID:nL6N0S34D8]
