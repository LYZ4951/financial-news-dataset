LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - European shares erased their early gains while futures on benchmark German government bonds turned higher on Monday after a key index of German business sentiment hit its lowest level in almost two years.

The Munich-based Ifo think-tank's business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, fell to 103.2 from 104.7 the previous month, suggesting Europe's largest economy could be in for a bumpy ride in the fourth quarter.
