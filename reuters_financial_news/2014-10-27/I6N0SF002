MILAN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, Italy's biggest bank by assets, does not plan to distribute excess capital, Chief Executive Federico Ghizzoni said on Monday.

"No, I certainly don't think so ... It's capital which we'll certainly need for organic growth," Ghizzoni said on the sidelines of a conference.
