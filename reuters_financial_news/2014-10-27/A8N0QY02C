ATHENS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Greek bank shares <.FTATBNK> jumped more than 5 percent early on Monday, leading the broader equities market higher, after the European Central Bank's health check turned out better than expected, traders said.

"We had a positive surprise, the market was not expecting such good news," said Theodore Krintas, head of wealth management at Attica Bank. "The bottom line is that banks will not need new money, valuations are adjusting upwards." The Athens bourse's banking index was gaining 5.5 percent at 0836 GMT to 149.4 points, outperforming the broader market's <.ATG> 3.1 percent rise. Eurobank <EURBr.AT> was adding 9.5 percent, with Piraeus Bank <BOPr.AT> up 6.1 percent.
