LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - European banking shares rallied on Monday after health checks from regulators and the European Central Bank reassured investors over the health of the region's financial system.

However, shares in Italian bank Monte Paschi <BMPS.MI> and Britain's Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> fell after Monte Paschi failed a test set by the European Central Bank and Lloyds only narrowly passed the health check. The Euro STOXX Banking Index <.SX7E> rose by 1.3 percent, with Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> surging 5.7 percent higher.
