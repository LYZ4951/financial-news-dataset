HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Struggling Chinese developer Agile Property Holdings Ltd <3383.HK> has obtained a critical 12-month extension to repay what remains of a $475 million loan due in December, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

Banks including HSBC Holdings <HSBA.L>, Standard Chartered <STAN.L> and Hang Seng Bank <0011.HK> agreed to extend as much as $265 million of the loan, the company said in a filing on Sunday. The rest of the loan will be repaid by the net proceeds of a $213 million rights issue Agile announced earlier this month. [ID:nL3N0SB19I]
