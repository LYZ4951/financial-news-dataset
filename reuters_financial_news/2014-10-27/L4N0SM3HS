Oct 27 (Reuters) - Indonesia's stock market fell to a more than one-week low on Monday as the appointment of a new cabinet failed to lift investor sentiment, while in several other Southeast Asian markets upbeat U.S. economic data helped cap the falls.

The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> ended down 1 percent, led by financials, with Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> and Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK> falling 2.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.  Indonesia's new president on Sunday named professional technocrats to lead the top economic ministries and implement much-needed reforms that address costly fuel subsidies, cooling investment and creaky infrastructure in Southeast Asia's biggest economy.

Foreigners, however, bought a net $55.65 million worth of Indonesian shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Kuala Lumpur saw net foreign outflows of $9.07 million, while Manila witnessed $6.58 million in outflows, data from their exchanges showed.  For Bangkok, it was $41.43 million in outflows, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Asian equities rose on Monday, taking heart from upbeat U.S. economic data and slightly better-than-expected health checks on euro zone banks, which helped revive investor appetite for risk.

Vietnam <.VNI> closed down 1.8 percent in cautious trading as investors offloaded most stocks after one of the country's top tycoons was detained last week on suspicion of fraud. [ID:nL4N0SM30E]
