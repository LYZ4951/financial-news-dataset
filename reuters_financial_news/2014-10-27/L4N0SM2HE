BANGKOK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Thailand's stock exchange halted on Monday trading in shares of industrial estate developer Hemaraj Land and Development PCL <HEMRAJ.BK> and WHA Corp <WHA.BK> after the companies failed to clarify a news report about a possible acquisition.

A local newspaper reported on Monday that WHA was in talks to acquire a listed company with market value of about 50 billion baht ($1.5 billion).  The report sparked speculation that Hemaraj was the target, which helped push Hemaraj shares up more than 4 percent in early trade.
