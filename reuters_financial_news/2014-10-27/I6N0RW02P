MILAN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Unicredit <CRDI.MI> CEO Federico Ghizzoni on Monday said he did not expect further further loan writedowns this year as a result of a banking review conducted by the European Central Bank.

Speaking on the sidelines of an industry event, Ghizzoni said Unicredit would not take part in any possible consolidation of the sector in the wake of the tests. Shares in Italy's Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> slumped on Monday after an industry health check found it had the biggest capital hole to fill among European banks. [ID:nL5N0SM1AD]
