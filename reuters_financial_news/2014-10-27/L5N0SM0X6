SOFIA, Oct 27 (Reuters) - These are some of the main stories in Bulgarian newspapers on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

-- Boiko Borisov, the leader of the centre-right GERB party which won the parliamentary elections earlier this month, said the formation of a stable government was a nearly impossible task and he was concerned about how stable the next cabinet could be (Presa, Monitor, Trud, 24 Chasa, Capital daily). -- Borisov said if a stable government is not formed, it would be better for everyone to form a temporary technocratic cabinet and agree on a new date for parliamentary elections, July 1 2015, for example, adding there is a possibility for two-in-one elections - parliamentary and local elections, in order to save money from organising two elections in one year (Presa, Monitor). -- GERB and the Socialist party (BSP), which came second in the parliamentary elections, called for the immediate resignation of the central bank's management over its inability to find a solution for the troubled Corporate Commercial Bank (Trud, 24 Chasa, Standart, Duma).  -- A 38-year-old woman was found dead after going missing on Saturday as torrential rains flooded the Primorsko Municipality near the Black Sea city of Burgas (Trud, 24 Chasa, Presa, Standart, Duma).
