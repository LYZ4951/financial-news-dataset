HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd <0388.HK> were set to open 3.4 percent lower on Monday, heading for their biggest daily decline in six months, amid uncertainty over the launch date of a scheme linking Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks.

The shares, which have risen more than 33 percent since the scheme was announced in early April, were set to open at HK$168.5 per share. That was compared to a 0.12 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index <.HSI>. A landmark stock trading agreement between Hong Kong and Shanghai will not be launched next week as initially expected as the link-up has not yet won regulatory approval, the Hong Kong stock exchange's chief executive, Charles Li, said on Sunday.
