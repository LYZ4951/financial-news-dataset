MILAN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Trading in Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> was suspended on Monday after shares opened down more than 17 percent following stress tests carried out by European authorities which showed the lender had a capital shortfall of around 810 million euros ($1.03 billion).

Genoa-based Carige and bigger rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> are the only two Italian banks - among the nine that were found short of capital at the end of last year by the stress tests - that still need to raise cash despite having carried out share sales in the course of 2014. [ID:nL5N0SL0KL] Carige said on Sunday it would seek to raise at least 500 million euros by selling new shares to investors.[ID:nI6N0RW029] Banco Popolare, which had a capital shortfall at the end of last year but already filled it, opened more than 6 percent higher and was up 5.11 percent at 12.97 euros by 0717 GMT. Italy's banking index <.FTIT8300> opened up more than 2 percent, but pared some gains and was up 0.23 percent at 0717 GMT.
