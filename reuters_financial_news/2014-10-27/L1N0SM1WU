NEW YORK, Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were slightly lower in early afternoon trading on Monday, led by a drop in energy shares as oil prices extended recent declines.

Shares of Gilead Sciences <GILD.O>, up 1.7 percent, helped to limit some of the declines, along with Micron Technology <MU.O>, which jumped 3.5 percent after it announced a $1 billion stock repurchase. But the S&P 500 energy index <.SPNY>, down 2.1 percent, was the biggest negative influence on the benchmark index, with U.S. crude <CLc1> briefly trading below $80 a barrel. Goldman Sachs slashed its crude price forecasts, citing abundant supply and lackluster demand. "We did have a big run last week, so the fact that we're flattish today is not a surprise," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama."There's continued focus on the price of oil, and the debate is, yes, it really helps the consumer... But, in terms of the producers, it's certainly a headwind to say the least." The S&P 500 posted its best weekly percentage gain Friday since January 2013.  At 1:40 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 4.33 points, or 0.03 percent, to 16,801.08, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 4.11 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,960.47 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 4.20 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,479.52. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Juniper Networks <JNPR.N>, which rose 3.5 percent, while the largest decliner was Halliburton <HAL.N>, down 6.7 percent. Micron was the largest gainer on the Nasdaq 100, while the largest decliner was Tesla Motors <TSLA.O>, down 5.5 percent.  Shares of Brazilian companies traded in the United States tumbled after President Dilma Rousseff won reelection in a runoff vote, defeating centrist and market favorite Aecio Neves by a slim margin. Petrobras ADRs <PBR.N> slumped 13 percent  and Vale <VALE.N> lost 5.5 percent. A Brazilian exchange-traded fund <EWZ.P> dropped 4 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,883 to 1,092, for a 1.72-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,563 issues fell and 1,043 advanced for a 1.50-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
