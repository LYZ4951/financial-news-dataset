SHANGHAI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - China's CSI300 index <.CSI300> fell more than 1 percent in early trading on Monday, led by brokerages, after the Hong Kong stock exchange chief said a closely-watched scheme linking Hong Kong and Shanghai had not yet won regulatory approval.

Western Securities <002673.SZ> tumbled 5.3 percent, followed by Pacific Securities Co Ltd <601099.SS> which fell 4.6 percent. China Merchants Securities Co Ltd <600999.SS> and Haitong Securities <600837.SS> both declined by about 2 percent each.
