FRANKFURT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse's <DB1Gn.DE> said its operating profit more than doubled in the third quarter, helped by a rise in revenue compared with the year-earlier quarter, which was burdened by legal settlement costs.

Quarterly earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 232.5 million euros ($295 million), beating an average expectation of 219 million euros in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages and up from 101 million euros a year earlier. [ID:nL6N0SJ0XX]
