SHANGHAI, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Chinese shares fell on Monday, dragged lower by brokerages on uncertainty over the launch of a landmark scheme linking the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges.

Investors were also disappointed after a key Communist Party meeting last week ended without any announcement of major policies to support the slowing economy, analysts said. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.5 percent at 2,290.42 points, while the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.9 percent. Financials were the main drags on the mainland market with CITIC Securities <600030.SS> and Haitong Securities <600837.SS>, the country's two biggest listed brokerages, both down 2.8 percent.
