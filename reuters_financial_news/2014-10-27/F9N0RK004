FRANKFURT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank spent 1.704 billion euros last week on covered bonds under a new purchase programme with which it hopes to foster lending to businesses and thereby support the euro zone economy.

Covered bonds are debt backed by pools of home or commercial properties, and 90 percent of the global market is based in Europe, especially in Denmark, Germany, Spain, France and Sweden. The covered bond purchases, which the ECB began making last week, are part of a stimulus package the central bank hopes will ease lending conditions and generate positive spill-over effects to other markets. As part of the package, the ECB is also offering banks cheap, long-term loans (TLTROs) and plans to buy asset-backed securities (ABS) - or bundled loans - later this year.
