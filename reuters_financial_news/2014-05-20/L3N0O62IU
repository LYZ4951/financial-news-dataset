SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, May 20 (Reuters) - Bank of China <601988.SS> and Malaysia's Hong Leong Bank <HLBB.KL> are among the bidders shortlisted to buy Indonesia's state-owned Bank Mutiara Tbk, people with knowledge of the bidding process said on Tuesday.

Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> has also qualified to bid, its finance director Achmad Baiquni told Reuters. Poltak L. Tobing, an official at the state-run Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation, told Reuters the bank 11 bidders had been shortlisted. He declined to identify any of the bidders. Non-binding bids are due next month, the sources said. They declined to be named because the sale process was confidential.
