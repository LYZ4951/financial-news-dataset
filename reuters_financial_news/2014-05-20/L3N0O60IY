BANGKOK, May 20 (Reuters) - Thailand's baht fell against the dollar in early trade on Tuesday after the imposition of martial law by the army, but it steadied later and dealers suspected that was due to intervention by the central bank.

At 0157 GMT the baht was quoted at 32.52/59 per dollar after earlier trading at a low of around 32.64 <THB=TH>.
