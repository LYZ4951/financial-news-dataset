May 20 (Reuters) - The leading U.S. health insurance trade group on Tuesday hit out at the extremely high cost of new specialty medicines, accusing drugmakers of taking advantage of the insurance system by pricing products at unsustainable levels.

The latest salvo in the war on escalating U.S. healthcare costs came from AHIP - America's Health Insurance Plans - and targeted Sovaldi, the new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc <GILD.O>. "Sovaldi has shown tremendous results, and it's the kind of medical innovation we need to sustain. Unfortunately, the drug's maker has priced it at an astronomical level that is not sustainable for consumers, innovation, or society," AHIP said on its Coverage blog. Sovaldi is the first in a new wave of all-oral treatments for the liver disease that has been a tremendous advance over prior treatments. The new drug has demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients in just 12 weeks or less with few side effects. Prior to the Sovaldi approval, hepatitis C treatments took 24 or 48 weeks, cured about 75 percent of patients and involved many more pills as well as injectable interferon that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that led many people to avoid or discontinue treatment. But concern that hundreds of thousands of patients will  seek treatment with the Gilead drug that costs roughly $1,000 per pill has provided a rallying point for insurers and others seeking to rein in the skyrocketing cost of new medicines in the United States, which has no price controls on drugs, unlike Europe and other countries. In its first full quarter on the market, Sovaldi had more than $2 billion in sales, shattering previous pharmaceutical records. Representatives from Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Drugmakers have argued that it costs billions of dollars to  develop new medicines and that high prices are necessary to sustain innovation. They also note that a treatment such as Sovaldi can save future healthcare costs by preventing liver failure, cancer or the need for a transplant. The campaign against Gilead may also be an effort to pressure other drugmakers, such as Merck & Co <MRK.N>, AbbVie <ABV.N> and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co <BMY.N>, before they set prices for their hepatitis C drugs that are expected to gain regulatory approval in the next year or two. AHIP said promising new drugs are being priced in a way that threatens Americans' access to them. "We need to find a solution that ensures important drugs like Sovaldi are priced at sustainable levels so that we can foster even more life-saving innovation." John Castellani, chief executive of PhRMA, the leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, said the problem is an insurance system that pushes too much of the cost of treatment onto the patient with high co-pays and deductibles for drugs.
