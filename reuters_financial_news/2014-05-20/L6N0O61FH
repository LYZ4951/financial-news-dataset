LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Tuesday following losses in the previous three sessions, with telecom company Vodafone <VOD.L> falling after saying its core earnings would fall in 2015 due to the investment needed in the business.

At 0708 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which last week hit a six-year high of 1,372.81, was up 0.06 percent at  1,359.66 points. National benchmark indices in U.K., France and Germany were trading flat to 0.1 percent higher. Vodafone shares fell 3.4 percent, the biggest decliner on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, after the world's second-largest mobile operator also said it recorded impairments of 6.6 billion pounds ($11 billion) due to fierce competition and regulatory changes in Europe.
