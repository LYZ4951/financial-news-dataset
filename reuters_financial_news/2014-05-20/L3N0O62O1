HONG KONG, May 20 (Reuters) - Demand to pull out money from hedge funds rose to five month high in May as investors looked to adjust their portfolios ahead of the mid-year point.

The SS&C <SSNC.O> GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator, a monthly snapshot of hedge fund clients giving notice to withdraw their cash expressed as a percentage of assets under administration, rose to 4.32 percent in May from 3.23 percent in April and the highest since December last year. The bulk of the activity in May represented typical semi-annual requests, Bill Stone, chairman and chief executive of SS&C Technologies, said in a statement.

Such requests have risen every May since at least 2008, data from SS&C GlobeOp shows.
