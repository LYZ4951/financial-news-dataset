ATHENS, May 20 (Reuters) - Greek property prices continued to fall in the first quarter, even though economic recession eased, as squeezed household incomes, record high unemployment and tax increases still took a toll, data showed on Tuesday.

Property accounts for a large chunk of household wealth as Greece has one of the highest home ownership rates in western Europe - 80 percent versus a European Union average of 70 percent - according to European Mortgage Federation data. Bank of Greece data showed that apartment prices fell 7.5 percent in the first three months of 2014 from a year earlier, after an 8.6 percent decline in the previous quarter. Higher property taxes to help plug budget deficits, coupled with tight credit from capital-strapped banks and a jobless rate hovering near 27 percent have pressured the market as Athens struggles to emerge from a crippling debt crisis. Based on the central bank data, apartment prices have plunged 34.7 percent from a peak in 2008, when the country's recession began. The property market could start to see some relief if the economy pulls out of a six-year recession this year. Greece's economy shrank by 1.1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace of contraction in four years. The government and its international lenders project a mild expansion of 0.6 percent for the full year. [ID:nL6N0O12BO] Annual property price declines have accelerated since 2010 when the country's debt crisis exploded. Prices fell 4.7 percent in 2010, 5.5 percent in 2011 and 11.7 percent in 2012.
