SYDNEY, May 20 (Reuters) - Australia's Treasury Wine Estates <TWE.AX> said on Tuesday it rejected a A$3.1 billion ($2.90 billion) takeover offer from private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co LP <KKR.N> on the grounds that the bid was too low.

Treasury said U.S.-based KKR offered A$4.70 per share on April 16 but that the offer price did not represent the company's fundamental value. The stock closed at A$4.07 on Monday.
