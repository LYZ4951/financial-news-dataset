May 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its global criteria for rating  structured finance (SF) transactions.  The changes to the report will not have  any rating impact on existing SF transactions. The criteria describe Fitch's overarching approach to analysing SF transactions  and identify the key considerations when assigning a SF rating. These include  asset isolation and legal structure, asset quality, credit enhancement,  financial structure and originator and servicer quality. The report also  describes the agency's expectations regarding bankruptcy remote special purpose  vehicles which are used in SF transactions.  In this update, Fitch has included a description of the additional risks  presented by transactions with revolving periods together with potential  structural mitigants.  In instances where the revolving period poses excessive  risk, Fitch may decline to rate or cap the maximum achievable rating for the  transaction.  The report has also been expanded to include a section on the agency's  analytical approach when reviewing representations and warranties which are  given by key parties to a transaction. It also identifies instances where the  robustness of the representations and warranties may be subject to additional  scrutiny.  Other minor text updates have also been included. The principles discussed in the criteria are applicable to all asset classes  including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed  securities and structured credit transactions. The criteria provide an  overarching framework applicable to all SF transactions which is complemented by  asset class-specific and cross-sector rating criteria.
