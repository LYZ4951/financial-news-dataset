KIGALI, May 20 (Reuters) - The African Development Bank is considering three ways it could help Zimbabwe clear its huge debts and will settle on a rescue package in three months time, the bank's chief economist said on Tuesday.

The International Monetary Fund in January approved a six-month extension of a monitoring programme for Zimbabwe aimed at helping it to clear $10 billion in external debts and give it access to much-needed new international credit. "We have three or so options that we think Zimbabwe can pursue and get out of this debt quagmire," Mthuli Ncube told a news conference on the sidelines of the AfDB annual meeting. The bank's deal to help Zimbabwe, which is emerging from a decade of economic decline and hyperinflation, will be disclosed in three months time, he said.
