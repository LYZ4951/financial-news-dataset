FRANKFURT, May 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank improved its leverage ratio by 24 basis points from 2.5 percent by selling 3.5 billion euros ($4.80 billion) of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, a source close to the transaction said on Tuesday.

Deutsche Bank's first-ever AT1 issue was a multi-currency benchmark deal intended to address concerns about its capital reserves.[ID:WEB00NHL] Deutsche also plans to raise an additional 8 billion euros in equity capital through a share placement and rights issue in June, a measure that would alone improve the bank's leverage ratio from 2.5 percent to 3.1 percent once the transaction is completed, Deutsche said on Monday.[ID:nL6N0O50WE]
