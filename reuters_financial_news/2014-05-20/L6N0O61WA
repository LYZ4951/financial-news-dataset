BUDAPEST, May 20 (Reuters) - Several banks are set to leave Hungary and the number of major lenders in the market is also expected to decline in an ongoing transformation of the sector, central bank Director Marton Nagy said on Tuesday.

Central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said in December that four major foreign banks could quit Hungary within the next 18 months.
