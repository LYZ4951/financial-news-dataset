DUBAI, May 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co <4300.SE> plans to price a benchmark-sized, dollar-denominated sukuk of five years duration this week, a document from lead arrangers said.

Initial price thoughts for the sukuk are at the high 6 percent range, the document said. Benchmark size traditionally means around $300 million for issuers classified as high-yield - meaning they pay a higher interest rate because of their low credit rating. Dar Al Arkan is rated B+ by Standard & Poor's, four notches below the lowest investment grade score, albeit with a positive outlook.  The developer said on Monday it would talk with international investors on Tuesday ahead of a potential sukuk. Dar Al Arkan has chosen Alkhair Capital - a unit of Bahrain-based Bank Alkhair, whose chairman is the same as Dar Al Arkan's - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> as coordinators and bookrunners of the potential deal.
