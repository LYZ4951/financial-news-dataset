HONG KONG, May 20 (Reuters) - China shares lingered at three-week lows on Tuesday, as continued losses in the beverage sector offset most gains from financial and energy counters.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended a choppy session up 0.2 percent at 2,008.12 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings finished flat. The ChiNext index <.CHINEXTC> of mostly high-tech start-ups listed in Shenzhen gained 1.4 percent, after the country's top securities regulator said it anticipates 100 initial public offerings between June and the end of the year, a smaller amount than some investors had feared.
