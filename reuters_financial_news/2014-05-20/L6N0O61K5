BERNE, May 20 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank will continue to do business with Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> as it has done in the past despite the bank's guilty plea to helping wealthly Americans dodge taxes, the central bank's chairman said on Tuesday.

"We will continue our business relationship with Credit Suisse as was the case in the past," Thomas Jordan said at an event in Bern.
