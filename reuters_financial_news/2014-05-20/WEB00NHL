FRANKFURT, May 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank has sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.80 billion) of its first-ever Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, a multi-currency benchmark deal intended to address concerns about its capital reserves.

Germany's flagship lender said on Tuesday it placed a 1.75 billion euro tranche with a coupon of 6 percent, a $1.25 billion tranche with a coupon of 6.25 percent and a 650 million pound tranche with a coupon of 7.125 percent.  Deutsche Bank had been deluged with a demand equivalent to more than 25 billion euros and had over 1000 orders in its order book, sources familiar with the transaction said.
