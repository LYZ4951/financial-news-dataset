LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - British estate agency Countrywide <CWD.L> has appointed former medical insurance executive Alison Platt as group chief executive with effect from Sept. 1, the company said on Tuesday.

Britain's largest estate agency by revenue said current chief executive Grenville Turner would become non-executive chairman from that date. It announced in Febuary that Turner would step down in 2014 to take the chairman role. [ID:nL6N0LW19V]
