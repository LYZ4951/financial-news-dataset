May 20 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Indonesia-based PT Bank Central Asia Tbk <BBCA.JK> (BCA), PT Bank Danamon Tbk <BDMN.JK> (Danamon) and PT Bank Pan Indonesia Tbk <PNBN.JK> (Panin). The rating Outlooks are Stable. Fitch has also assigned National Short-Term Ratings of 'F1+(idn)' to BCA and Danamon, a Short-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B' to Panin and Support Rating Floor of 'BB' to Danamon. A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary.  'AAA(idn)' Long-Term National Ratings denote the highest ratings assigned by  Fitch on its national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to  issuers or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to  all other issuers or obligations in the same country. 'AA(idn)' Long-Term National Ratings denote expectations of very low default  risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default  risk inherently differs only slightly from that of the country's highest rated  issuers or obligations.  'F1(idn)' Short-Term National Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. Under the agency's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned  to the lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the  liquidity profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VRs and National Ratings  BCA's IDRs, Viability Ratings (VRs) and National Ratings reflect Fitch's view  that its strong credit fundamentals will continue to be underpinned by its  business model that focuses on low-risk transactional banking and will remain  comparable with higher rated peers' in emerging markets over the medium term.  However, the credit profile is constrained by BCA's operating environment. BCA  has demonstrated resilient and strong performance in terms of asset quality and  profitability through economic cycles. It has built up a substantial loss  absorption buffer against more challenging operating conditions, with Fitch Core  Capital (FCC) ratio at 17.5% and loan loss provision at 1.8% of gross loans at  end-1Q14.  Danamon's IDRs, VRs and National Ratings reflect its strong capital profile (FCC  ratio at 19% at end-1Q14) and satisfactory profitability and its relatively  weaker funding profile. The bank's loan-to-deposit ratio remains high and well  above the industry average. The bank heavily relies on high cost deposits, with  non-CASA (current account and saving account) deposits making up around 60% of  total deposits at end-1Q14. The bank's focus on mass-market lending results in  non-performing loan (NPL) ratios that are higher than the industry average, but  this is mitigated by its strong interest margins. Fitch expects the bank's  profitability to moderate from a high base, given an expected rise in funding  and credit costs and slower growth in mass-market loans.   Panin's IDRs, VRs and National Ratings reflect declining and below-average  capitalisation, moderate asset quality, and modest earnings compared with  higher-rated Indonesian banks. Panin's core capital has gradually declined, but  it remained satisfactory with FCC ratio at 15.7% at end-1Q14 due to strong  credit growth (23% CAGR in 2011-2013). Loan growth moderated to 13% in 2013 from  very strong growth of 28% CAGR in 2011-2012, but remained faster than the  increase in its internal capital generation. Fitch expects Panin to further  reduce its loan growth to conserve capital and improve asset quality.  The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that the three banks will be  able to comfortably cover the potential increase in non-performing loans and  rise in credit and funding costs without impairing capital due to their  satisfactory pre-provision profits and loan loss provisions. In addition,  Indonesian regulators' recent moves, including implementing stricter  requirements in borrowers' down payment and banks' loans-to-deposits ratios in  2013, will help to prevent the build-up of excessive risk in the system.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs, and National Ratings BCA's ratings are sensitive to overly aggressive asset expansion, a significant  change in its business model resulting in greater appetite for risks and/or a  sharp deterioration of the operating environment manifested by a lower sovereign  rating.  Danamon's ratings are sensitive to its funding and liquidity profile. Rating  upside for Danamon may result from material improvement in its franchise and  flexibility in funding and liquidity while maintaining sound asset quality.  For Panin, rapid loan expansion, which could negatively affect its capital and  funding position in a difficult economy, may result in a downgrade to the bank's  VR. However, as the 'BB' IDR of Panin is at the same level as its SRF, the IDR  will not be affected by a downgrade of the bank's VR, unless considerations  underpinning its 'BB' SRF also weaken. Sustained improvements in its ability to  generate capital and asset quality are positive for an VR update.   RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING (SRs) and SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  (SRFs) BCA's, Danamon's and Panin's SRs and SRFs, reflect Fitch's view of a moderate  probability of extraordinary state support available to them, if needed. Fitch  believes that these three banks are systemically important to the country  because BCA, Danamon and Panin are the third, sixth and seven largest banks in  Indonesia by assets, respectively. A change in the government's ability and  willingness to provide extraordinary support would affect these banks' SRs and  SRFs.  The list of rating actions is as follows:  BCA:  Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'F3'  National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AAA(idn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating assigned at 'F1+(idn)' Support Rating affirmed at '3'  Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb-'  Danamon: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR affirmed at 'B';  National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA+(idn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating assigned at 'F1+(idn)' Support Rating affirmed at '3';  Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Support Rating Floor assigned at 'BB'  Panin: Long-Term IDR affirmed at 'BB'; Outlook Stable Short-Term IDR assigned at 'B'   Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb'  Support Rating affirmed at '3'
