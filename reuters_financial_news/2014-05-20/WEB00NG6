ZURICH, May 20 (Reuters) - Switzerland's financial regulator effectively cleared Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> top management of blame for the Swiss bank's guilty plea and a $2.5 billion fine for helping Americans evade taxes, in a report released on Tuesday.

FINMA, the regulator, said the Zurich-based lender had violated Swiss supervisory law by failing to adequately monitor and control the business of its private bankers with U.S. clients.
