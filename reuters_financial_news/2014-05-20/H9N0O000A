HONG KONG, May 20 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index rose to a five-week closing high on Tuesday, helped by China Mobile after a broker upgrade pushed shares of the telecom giant to their highest since January.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended up 0.6 percent at 22,834.68 points, its highest close since April 14.  The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 0.3 percent, pulled down mainly by weaker Chinese banks in the afternoon. China Construction Bank Corp <0939.HK>, Tuesday's biggest drag on indexes, shed 0.7 percent.  China Mobile Ltd <0941.HK> rose 1.8 percent to its highest close since Jan. 8 after Goldman Sachs put the world's largest telecom carrier by subscriber base on its conviction buy list. Competitor China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd <0762.HK>, on which Goldman has a neutral rating, was down 3.1 percent.
