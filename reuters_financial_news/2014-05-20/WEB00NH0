ZURICH, May 20 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> Chief Executive Brady Dougan said on Tuesday he remained "very committed" to the Swiss bank and had never considered stepping down.

Dougan was speaking on a call with analysts and reporters after the U.S. government announced that his bank had agreed to pay a $2.5 billion fine after pleading guilty to helping Americans evade taxes. "Going forward I'm very committed to Credit Suisse and focused on taking the business and strategy forward," Dougan said.
