FRANKFURT, May 20 (Reuters) - British private equity company Terra Firma [TERA.UL] and a co-investor on Tuesday placed a 12.5 percent stake in Deutsche Annington <ANNGn.DE> with investors, sending shares in the German property group lower.

The buyout group led by British financier Guy Hands and its partner Citigroup Property Investors sold 30 million shares for 19.50 euros apiece, a source familiar with the transaction said. Terra Firma and Deutsche Annington declined to comment. Shares in Deutsche Annington <ANNGn.DE> were down 5.5 percent to 20.21 euros by 1029 GMT, leading the biggest decliners in Frankfurt's small-cap index <.SDAXI>. Terra Firma is also planning to transfer its remaining shares in Deutsche Annington, held through investment vehicle Terra Firma Deutsche Annington Fund (TFDA), to the fund's owners. [ID:nL6N0O54GP]  That move will likely put further pressure on Deutsche Annington shares as some of TFDA's investors may sell as soon as a 90 day lock-up period expires, a Frankfurt-based trader said. TFDA holds a 67.3 percent stake Deutsche Annington.
