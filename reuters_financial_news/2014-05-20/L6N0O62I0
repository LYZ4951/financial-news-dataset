MADRID, May 20 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Liberbank <LBK.MC> said on Tuesday it was planning an accelerated share placement to bring in investors before proceeding with a further capital raising, which it is carrying out to pay back state aid.

The bank, among lenders which took part of a 41.3-billion-euro ($56.66 billion) European rescue when it was hurt by a property crash, said it was in talks with various investors interested in taking a sizeable chunk of its capital, but had not reached any deal yet.
