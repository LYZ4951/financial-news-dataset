PARIS, May 20 (Reuters) - A fund led by Andrea Bonomi further raised its stake in Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> to above 10 percent, three days ahead of the closure deadline for a takeover offer for the French holiday firm that the Italian businessman opposes.

Bonomi-led Strategic Holdings bought an additional 427,635 Club Med shares at 18.96 euros each on May 19, raising its total stake to 3.36 million shares, stock market watchdog AMF said.
