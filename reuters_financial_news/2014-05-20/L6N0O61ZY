MADRID, May 20 (Reuters) - Spain's Realia <RLIA.MC> said on Tuesday that the sale of its 59 percent stake in French property investment group SIIC de Paris <IMMB.PA> would reduce its net debt by just over 1 billion euros ($1.37 billion) and involve a loss.

The Spanish real estate company said earlier on Tuesday it had agreed to sell the holding to France's Eurosic <ESIC.PA>. [ID:nL6N0O61JB]
