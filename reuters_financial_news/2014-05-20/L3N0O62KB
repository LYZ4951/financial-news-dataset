May 20 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1000 GMT on Tuesday:

** Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> is in the final stages of selling a portfolio of Spanish property loans for up to 3.9 billion euros ($5.4 billion) to JP Morgan <JPM.N> and private equity firm Lone Star, sources close to the matter said. [ID:nL6N0O61U2]  ** British aerospace and defence supplier Cobham <COB.L> is buying U.S. communications equipment maker Aeroflex Holding Corp <ARX.N> for $1.46 billion, continuing its quest for more commercial customers as its main defence clients cut spending. [ID:nL6N0O61KR]  ** Australia's Treasury Wine Estates <TWE.AX> is betting its Penfolds brand and a cost-cutting new CEO will boost earnings and justify its decision to reject a $2.90 billion takeover offer from private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co LP. The world's No. 2 winemaker said it had rejected KKR's bid as too low, sending its share price above the bid value as investors rushed to get in ahead of any new offers from other parties. [ID:nL3N0O606G]  ** London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> said it entered into exclusive talks with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance to acquire its asset management and stock index unit, Russell Investments. [ID:nFWN0O202G]  ** Private equity group BC Partners [BCPRT.UL] is considering selling French domestic cleaning products maker Spotless Group and is looking for a price tag of between 900 million euros ($1.23 billion) to 1 billion euros, Les Echos said. [ID:nL6N0O61BE]  ** Italian cement maker Italcementi <ITAI.MI> said it had set final price in a takeover bid for the shares in its French unit Ciments Francais <CMFP.PA> that it does not yet own at 79.5 euros ($110) per share. The price is 'ex dividend' and is an increase from a preliminary takeover price of 78 euros announced on March 6, which included the dividend. [ID:nL6N0O61CG]  ** French nuclear group Areva <AREVA.PA> could be interested in a deal for Alstom's <ALSO.PA> wind turbines unit, its CEO said, while adding Areva was not directly involved in talks over the possible sale of Alstom's energy business. [ID:nL6N0O61OH]  ** Ophthotech Corp <OPHT.O> said it could potentially receive over $1 billion in payments as part of a licensing deal for its experimental eye drug with Novartis AG <NOVN.VX>. [ID:nL3N0O54AQ]  ** British insurer RSA Insurance Group Plc <RSA.L> said on Monday it had reached agreement to sell its majority-owned Canadian brokerage business - Noraxis Capital Corp - to U.S. insurance brokerage Arthur J. Gallagher & Co <AJG.N> for C$500 million ($460.60 million). [ID:nL3N0O60AV]  ** China-focused private equity firm Hopu Investments Co. Ltd. plans to acquire a minority share in Russia's largest untapped copper deposit by the end of 2014, the operator of the project said. The project's operator, Baikal Mining Co, and Hopu have also agreed to form an investment consortium comprising major Chinese players in the industrial sector and financial institutions for the project. [ID:nL6N0O620W]  ** A fund led by Andrea Bonomi further raised its stake in Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> to above 10 percent, three days ahead of the closure deadline for a takeover offer for the French holiday firm that the Italian businessman opposes. Bonomi-led Strategic Holdings now holds 10.5 percent of Club Med's capital, clouding prospects for a takeover offer launched a year ago by China's Fosun International <0656.HK> and French private equity firm Ardian. [ID:nWEB00NG4]  ** Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD> got regulatory approval from the United Arab Emirates' central bank for its purchase of Barclays' <BARC.L> retail operations in the country 10 days ago, its chief executive said. [ID:nL6N0O61U0]  ** The Finnish government proposed a sell-off of Altia, a liquor maker fully owned by the state, as it seeks new revenue to finance spending and reduce the need for borrowing. [ID:nL6N0O61VF]  ** Spanish real estate group Realia <RLIA.MC>, controlled by Spain's FCC <FFC.MC> and lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>, said it reached an exclusive agreement with French listed investment group Eurosic to sell its stake in another property vehicle, SIIC de Paris.
