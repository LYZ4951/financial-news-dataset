WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) - The $2.5 trillion in reserves accumulated by banks could be the trigger for more rapid inflation if banks start lending that money quickly in an improving U.S. economy, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday.

Plosser also said that it was the "natural tendency" of central bankers to wait too long to raise rates, and that inflationary forces may be building in the economy now that could force the Fed into a quicker-than-expected response, or use tools to restrain bank credit.
