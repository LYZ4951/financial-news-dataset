BUDAPEST, May 20 (Reuters) - Banks in Hungary have started shifting funds out of the central bank's main two-week liquidity instrument into government debt after the regulator announced plans to transform the instrument last month, central bank Director Marton Nagy said on Tuesday.

"Many banks have moved from two-week deposits toward government debt. One look at the government debt auctions or the yields shows what has happened in the past month," Nagy told a banking conference organised by financial news website portfolio.hu.
