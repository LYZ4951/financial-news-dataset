LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - Intermediate Capital Group plc <ICP.L> said on Tuesday it had raised a record amount of money across its products to boost third party assets under management by 8 percent to 10.7 billion euros ($14.68 billion).

The company, a specialist asset manager that provides mezzanine finance, private debt, leveraged credit and minority equity, said a record period of realisations during the period had left total assets under management flat at 13.0 billion euros. Pretax profit in the year to end-March 2014, meanwhile, was up 11 percent to 158.7 million pounds from 142.6 million pounds. ICG said in a statement that it would pay a final dividend of 14.4 pence per share to bring its total dividend for the year to 21.0 pence, a rise of 5 percent. It also announced a share buyback of up to 100 million pounds. "There is no doubt that investor interest in credit strategies is increasing," said ICG's chief executive, Christophe Evain, in a statement.
