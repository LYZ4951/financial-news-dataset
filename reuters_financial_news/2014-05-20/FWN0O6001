LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - British drugmaker AstraZeneca <AZN.L> said that there could be no further negotiation with U.S. suitor Pfizer <PFE.N> on the value of a takeover proposal, in a statement which it said it issued to clarify the situation under UK takeover rules.

"This restriction that prevents further negotiation on value is a consequence of Pfizer's actions," AstraZeneca's chairman Leif Johansson said in the statement.
