BRUSSELS, May 20 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators charged on Tuesday HSBC <HSBA.L>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> with rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro.

The move followed a record 1.7-billion-euro ($2.3 billion) fine levied on six banks including Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> and Citigroup <C.N> last December for similar offences. "The (European) Commission has concerns that the three banks may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro interest rate derivatives," the EU competition authority said.
