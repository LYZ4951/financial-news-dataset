HELSINKI, May 20 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has a suite of policy options to deploy if it needs to ease monetary policy further, including a broad-based asset-purchase programme, ECB Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said.

ECB President Mario Draghi set out similar options in a speech in Amsterdam on April 24. If deflation risks increase significantly, measures could include "nontraditional measures boosting demand, for example broad-based purchases of securities," Liikanen said in presentation slides dated May 14 and published on the Bank of Finland's website on Tuesday.
