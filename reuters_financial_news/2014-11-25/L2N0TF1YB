NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - A mid-afternoon flurry of buying in long-dated U.S. Treasury futures and exchange-traded funds pushed prices to session highs on Tuesday.

The purchases were part of a broad U.S. bond market rally in the wake of record low 10-year yields across Europe and a robust $35 billion five-year Treasuries note auction, analysts said. [ID:nL2N0TF1KU] At 2:06 p.m. EST (1906 GMT), 34,856 contracts of 10-year Treasury note futures for March 2015 delivery <TYH5> traded at a price of 126-9/32 and 18,950 contracts of March 2015 30-year Treasury bond futures <USH5> transacted at 141-11/32 on the Chicago Board of Trade, CME Group data showed. Traders said this block trade was likely a curve-flattening move in anticipation that long-term U.S. bond yields would fall further due to muted inflation and sluggish domestic growth. A minute later, Blackrock's ETF benchmarked to Barclays 20-plus year Treasury index <TLT.P> experienced a sudden surge in volume when 127,147 contracts traded, lifting its share price to nearly $121.02. Shares of the ETF had traded at $120.69 five minutes earlier, Reuters data showed. In late U.S. trading, it traded at $121.15, up 0.8 percent on the day.
