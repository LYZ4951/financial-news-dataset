VIENNA, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Russia-focused Austrian property firm Immofinanz <IMFI.VI> is heading for a positive second quarter on the back of foreign exchange rate effects and will continue to invest in Russia, Chief Executive Eduard Zehetner told Reuters.

Immofinanz's Russian portfolio is valued on the basis of the euro-rouble exchange rate, and a weak rouble increases the value of Immofinanz' portfolio due to technical, non-cash effects. When asked whether the second quarter will have a positive result, Zehetner said yes. In the first quarter of its financial year 2014/15 when the rouble strengthened, forex-based revaluations pushed Immofinanz to a net loss. [ID:nL6N0RK2GF] "In sum, the (second) quarter will be much better," he said. Russia's rouble <RUB=> has fallen almost 30 percent against the dollar this year, weakened by an economic downturn, made worse by a fall in global oil prices and sanctions imposed by the West over the crisis in Ukraine. Immofinanz is continuing to offer rent reductions to its Russian clients who are struggling to pay their rents with falling customer demand and a weaker rouble, Zehetner said. He added that such reductions resulted in less rental income between August and October compared with the previous quarter, when rental income rose. "Such an increase will not be possible to sustain throughout the year," Zehetner said. Nevertheless, Immofinanz is committed to Russia and will continue to invest there "moderately", Zehetner said, citing an 80-million euro extension to one of its Moscow shopping malls. Building will most likely not start before the end of 2015. "We must have good nerves...we believe in the Russian market," Zehetner said in an interview late on Monday.  Immofinanz depends on its five shopping centres in Moscow and a logistic centre in St. Petersburg for more than a third of its rental income.
