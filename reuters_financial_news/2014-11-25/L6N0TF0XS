TEL AVIV, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Gazit-Globe <GZT.TA>, Israel's largest real estate investment company, swung to a loss in the third quarter mainly due to losses from currency hedging transactions and said it would raise its dividend by 2 percent in 2015.

Gazit-Globe <GZT.N> said on Tuesday it lost 13 million shekels ($3.4 million) in the third quarter, compared with a profit of 314 million a year earlier. The 2013 quarter was boosted by a one-time gain. Rental income in the quarter fell 4 percent to 1.2 billion shekels, but was unchanged excluding exchange rate effects. Funds from operation rose 2 percent to 150 million shekels. Net operating income, which reflects the group's core business, slipped 2 percent to 840 million shekels but rose 2 percent excluding exchange rate effects.  It will pay a dividend of 0.45 shekel a share for the third quarter, representing an annual payout of 1.8 shekels. The company said it will pay a quarterly dividend of 0.46 shekel a share in 2015. Beginning in 2016, the company will announce changes to its dividend policy for the coming year in January.
