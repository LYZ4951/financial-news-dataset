LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone shares marked time on Tuesday after a two-day rise that left some key regional indexes in "overbought" territory on a technical basis.

An unexpected rise French industrial morale helped put a floor on the market, however, building on a strong German business sentiment survey on Monday. [ID:nP6N0Q402D] At 0811 the euro zone Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> was flat at 3,213.10 points. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> was up 0.1 percent while France's CAC <.FCHI> was flat. All three indexes closed in "overbought" territory on Monday, based on their 7-day Relative Strength Index, a momentum indicator which compares the magnitude of rises and falls in prices. "The market was pretty 'overbought' so a small pullback (in the Euro STOXX 50) from here towards 3,190 is normal," said Roelof-Jan van den Akker, a senior technical analyst an ING in Amsterdam said. "A short-term consolidation making a higher bottom for a couple of weeks before the next rally starts would be my most likely scenario." The broader FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of pan-European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,385.96 points.
