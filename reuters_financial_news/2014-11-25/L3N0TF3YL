BEIJING, Nov 25 (Reuters) - China's central bank will wait until the fourth quarter economic index is released before considering further rate cuts and easing, a central bank adviser said on Tuesday, adding a decision would depend on U.S. and Japanese monetary policy.

Chen Yulu, who sits on the central bank's monetary policy committee, also reiterated the central bank line that Friday's rate cut did not represent a change in monetary policy. Chen made the comments on the sidelines of an economy and finance forum in Beijing.
