FRANKFURT, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The low cost of borrowing carries risks of excess on financial markets such as those for corporate bonds and syndicated credit, Germany's Bundesbank warned on Tuesday.

"The longer the phase of low interest rates continues, the greater the danger of excess in certain segments of the market," Bundesbank Vice President Claudia Buch said in a statement on the publication of a report on financial stability.
