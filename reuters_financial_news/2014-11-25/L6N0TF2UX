DUBAI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Pakistan plans to price a dollar-denominated Islamic bond issue on Wednesday and currently expects it to yield around 6.875 percent, according to a document from lead managers.

The five-year sukuk is classified as benchmark size - meaning it will be worth upwards of $500 million. It was announced on Sunday that Pakistan would hold a series of meetings with fixed income investors in the United Arab Emirates on Monday and in both London and Singapore on Tuesday, before issuing a sukuk that complied with rules for selling it in the United States.
