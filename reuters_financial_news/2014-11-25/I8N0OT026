ANAND, India, Nov 25 (Reuters) - India is considering giving banks more flexibility when restructuring distressed loans in a bid to help cash-strapped projects to get funding from lenders, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.

"The RBI is exploring ways to allow banks more flexibility in restructuring," Rajan said in a speech at the Institute of Rural Management on Tuesday in the state of Gujarat. "This is a risk we are prepared to take if it allows more projects to be set on the track to recovery."
