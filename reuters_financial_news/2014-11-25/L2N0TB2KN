CHICAGO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - It's year-end, and retirement savers of all ages need to check their to-do lists. Here are some suggestions for current retirees, near-retirees and younger savers just getting started.

ALREADY RETIRED: TAKE YOUR DISTRIBUTION Unfortunately, the "deferred" part of tax-deferred retirement accounts doesn't last forever. Required minimum distributions (RMDs) must be taken from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) starting in the year you turn 70 1/2 and from 401(k)s at the same age, unless you're still working for the employer that sponsors the plan. Fidelity Investments reports that nearly 68 percent of the company's IRA account holders who needed to take RMDs for tax year 2014 hadn't done it as of late October. It's important to get this right: Failure to take the correct distribution results in an onerous 50 percent tax - plus interest - on any required withdrawals you fail to take.  RMDs must be calculated for each account you own by dividing the prior Dec. 31 balance with a life expectancy factor (found in IRS Publication 590). Your account provider may calculate RMDs for you, but the final responsibility is yours. FINRA, the financial services self-regulatory agency, offers a calculator (http://bit.ly/1xKMPWm), and the IRS has worksheets to help calculate RMDs (http://1.usa.gov/1uEYW5a). Take care of RMDs ahead of the year-end rush, advises Joshua Kadish, partner in planning firm RPG Life Transition Specialists in Riverwoods, Illinois. "We try to do it by Dec. 1 for all of our clients - if you push it beyond that, the financial institutions are all overwhelmed with year-end paperwork and they're getting backed up."  NEAR-RETIRED: CONSIDER THE ROTH Vanguard reports that 20 percent of its investors who take an RMD reinvest the funds in a taxable account - in other words, they didn't need the money. If you fall into this category, consider converting some of your tax-deferred assets to a Roth IRA. No RMDs are required on Roth accounts, which can be beneficial in managing your tax liability in retirement. You'll owe income tax on converted funds in the year of conversion. That runs against conventional planning wisdom, which calls for deferring taxes as long as possible. But it's a strategy that can make sense in certain situations, says Maria Bruno, senior investment analyst in Vanguard's Investment Counseling & Research group. "Many retirees find that their income may be lower in the early years of retirement - either because they haven't filed yet for Social Security, or perhaps one spouse has retired and the other is still working. Doing a conversion that goes to the top of your current tax bracket is something worth considering." Bruno suggests a series of partial conversions over time that don't bump you into a higher marginal bracket. Also, if you're not retired, check to see if your workplace 401(k) plan offers a Roth option, and consider moving part of your annual contribution there.  YOUNG: START EARLY, BUMP IT UP ANNUALLY "Time is on my side," sang the Rolling Stones, and it's true for young savers. Getting an early start is the single best thing you can do for yourself, even if you can't contribute much right now. Let the magic of compound returns help you over the years. A study done by Vanguard a couple years ago found that an investor who starts at age 25 with a moderate investment allocation and contributes 6 percent of salary will finish with 34 percent more in her account than the same investor who starts at 35 - and 64 percent more than an investor who starts at 45. Try to increase the amount every year. A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 43 percent of plan participants haven't increased their 401(k) contributions in the past two years. Kadish suggests a year-end tally of what you spent during the year and how much you saved. "It's not what people like to do - but you have a full year under your belt, so it's a good opportunity to look at where your money went. Could you get more efficient in some area, and save more?"
