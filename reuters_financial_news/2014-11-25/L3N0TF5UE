Nov 25 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn raised his stake in U.S. car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc <HTZ.N> to 10.77 percent from 8.48 percent.

The billionaire was already Hertz's largest shareholder and in the past few months had successfully pushed for management changes and won board seats on the company. [ID:nL1N0RC2U0] Hertz shares rose 1.7 percent to $25.68 in trading after the bell on Tuesday. Hertz has owned up to a string of accounting errors, originating in 2011, that will require it to restate or correct its financial results for the past three years. Earlier this month, Icahn-backed John Tague was named as Hertz's chief executive, fending off a challenge from Dollar Thrifty CEO Scott Thomson, who was backed by Jana Partners, the company's second-largest shareholder. [ID:nL3N0TA6AG] The role had fallen vacant in September after Mark Frissora stepped down citing personal reasons, about a month after the accounting issues came to light. [ID:nL3N0R92MK]
