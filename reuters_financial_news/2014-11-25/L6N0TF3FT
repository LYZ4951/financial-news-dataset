MOSCOW, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's top bank, is expected to post 69.6 billion roubles ($1.5 billion) in third-quarter net profit, down 26 percent year-on-year, due to higher provisions for loan losses, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

Sberbank is one of several Russian state-controlled banks subject to Western sanctions limiting their access to international capital markets over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis. Analysts said Sberbank would set aside more than 100 billion roubles in provisions in the third quarter, more than twice the amount a year earlier, because of risks linked to the Ukraine crisis, a slide in the rouble and non-performing loans. "The peak in provisions will be influenced by both a combination of risks, Ukrainian assets, the devaluation of the rouble and large non-performing loans, as well as Sberbank's prudential approach to setting aside provisions," Gazprombank analyst Andrey Klapko said. "We think the peak of provisions due to the above-mentioned risks is possible in the third and fourth quarters," he said. VTB <VTBR.MM>, Russia's second-largest bank, last week posted a 98 percent drop in third-quarter net profit, also stung by higher loan-loss provisions, Ukraine-related risks and a slowdown in the Russian economy.
