ZURICH, Nov 25 (Reuters) - A Vontobel <VONN.S> banker, who was detained in Poland in connection with the conviction of former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness for tax evasion, is back in Switzerland, Vontobel told Reuters on Tuesday.

"As far as possible, he will answer possible questions of the German authorities from Switzerland, where a German lawyer will support him," the Vontobel spokesman said.
