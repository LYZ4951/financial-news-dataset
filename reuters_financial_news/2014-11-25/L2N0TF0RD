NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were slightly higher on Tuesday as the market's long-running upward bias looked to continue, though further gains may be difficult to come by in a week that's expected to be quiet.

Equities have been strong of late. The S&P 500 <.SPX> is up for 12 of the past 14 sessions, and all three major indexes are coming off five-week streaks of gains. Both the Dow and S&P closed at records on Monday, and the S&P is up more than 13 percent from an intraday low hit in mid-October.  Much of the rally has come on bets for more stimulus from central banks around the world, which is expected to continue supporting markets, though the swiftness of the gains since October could spur some profit taking.  Market moves this week could be amplified by low volume, which is expected with some market participants out for the Thanksgiving holiday. The U.S. stock market will be closed on Thursday and will close early on Friday. Investors are looking ahead to the latest read on third-quarter economic growth, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT). Reads on home prices and consumer confidence will be released after the market opens; both are expected to show growth.
