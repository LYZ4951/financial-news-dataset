WASHINGTON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday proposed to impose tougher capital standards on General Electric's <GE.N> finance unit, one of a handful of non-bank firms deemed critically important to the health of the financial system.

The proposed standards would be generally similar to those that apply to large banks, the Fed said. The proposal was open for public comment for a period of 60 days. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act automatically designated banks with more than $50 billion in assets as "systemically important financial institutions."
