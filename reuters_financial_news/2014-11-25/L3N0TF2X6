HANOI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> bounced back 0.58 percent from its lowest close in almost a month to end on Tuesday on bargain hunting, but a low volume showed cautious sentiment dragging following a limit on stock investment loans.

Food producer Masan Group Corp <MSN.HM> led the gainers to climb 3.77 percent, followed by property firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> with a 2.71-percent advance. "It's a technical rebound today from the 580-point support level," said a trader with Ho Chi Minh City Securities, adding that the market has yet to recover from recent falls as selling near the session close was strong. A total of 114 million shares changed hand, compared with the five-day average of 141 million, based on Reuters data. The index dropped 0.94 percent on Monday to touch its lowest close since Oct. 27, following a central bank's announcement of a cap on loans for share investment and requirements for banks to provide the credit.
