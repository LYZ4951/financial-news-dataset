SHANGHAI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Shanghai's stock index reached a multi-year high on Tuesday as investors remained optimistic that China shares will get more policy support following the central bank's surprise cut in lending rates.

However, Hong Kong shares were down at midday. Analysts said  investors there were more cautious and consolidated positions after Monday's gains. Beijing is considering further cuts to interest rates and other policy adjustments, insiders told Reuters, on concerns about deflationary risks and high debt loads. Further easing would likely ease liquidity conditions, which would be highly positive for stocks in China.

The CSI300 index <.CSI300> rose to 2,667.13 points at the end of the morning, its highest level in over 20 months, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> gained 17.9 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,550.78 points, its highest level since end-August 2011.

In Hong Kong, "there is no movement at all. People are cautious," said Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong. "They are not willing to chase, and not selling aggressively as well." Wong added the overall tone in the market is positive and investors were expecting for additional rate cuts.
