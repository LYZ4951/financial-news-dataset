MADRID, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The euro zone risks facing a scenario of low inflation and low growth for a prolonged period, although the European Central Bank (ECB) has the means to deal with this if needed, Bank of Spain governor Luis Maria Linde said on Tuesday.

"There is a risk that growth and inflation will be very low for a long time, the ECB has the instruments to tackle that," Linde told a parliamentary commission, adding he did not see any signs of deflation.
