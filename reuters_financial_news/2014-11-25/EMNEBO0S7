NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Short interest on the Nasdaq fell 2.4 percent in the first half of November, the exchange said on Tuesday.  As of Nov. 14, short interest fell to about 8.798 billion shares, compared with 9.01 billion shares as of Oct. 31.  Investors who sell securities 'short' borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.  Shorting can also be part of a hedging strategy.  (U.S. markets team) ((+1-646-223-6344))  Keywords: MARKETS SHORTINTEREST/NASDAQ
