MOSCOW, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Rating agency Standard & Poor's is unlikely to change Russia's rating even if the country falls into recession, the agency's senior director for sovereign ratings, Christian Esters, said on Tuesday.

"External and fiscal buffers are strong enough to support the rating even if the economy goes into recession," he said at a conference in Moscow.
