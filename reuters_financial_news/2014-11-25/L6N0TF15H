LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - European shares marked time on Tuesday after a two-day rise that left some regional indexes in technical "overbought" territory.

An unexpected rise French industry morale helped put a floor on the market, however, building on a strong German business sentiment survey on Monday. [ID:nP6N0Q402D] The euro zone Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> was flat at 3,212.26 points. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> was up 0.1 percent while France's CAC <.FCHI> down 0.1 percent. All three indexes closed in "overbought" territory on Monday, based on their 7-day Relative Strength Index, a momentum indicator which compares the magnitude of rises and falls in prices. "A small pullback (in the Euro STOXX 50) from here towards 3,190 is normal," said Roelof-Jan van den Akker, a senior technical analyst an ING in Amsterdam. "A short-term consolidation ... for a couple of weeks before the next rally starts would be my most likely scenario." The broader FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of pan-European shares was flat at 1,386.23 points.  Energy companies weighed on the FTSEurofirst as Brent crude oil prices fell to $79.50 on the back of lower expectation of a significant output cut by OPEC. [ID:nL3N0TF27E]  Kingfisher <KGF.L> was among top fallers on the index, shedding 2.4 percent after Europe's No. 1 home improvement retailer posted an 11.8 percent decline in third quarter profit, hurt by a weak French market and foreign currency movements. [ID:nL6N0TF0QM] Zodiac Aerospace <ZODC.PA> was the top riser, up 4.4 percent, after the maker of aircraft cabin interiors and systems predicted a gradual return towards normal levels of profitability in the current financial year.
