NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has put his three-bedroom Brooklyn home up for rent, having moved in June to Gracie Mansion, the grand mayoral residence on Manhattan's Upper East Side, his office said on Thursday.

The house will rent for $4,975 a month, according to the listing, which describes the residence as a "charming country-style private house" located in "prime South Slope," referring to one of the more desirable corners of gentrifying Brooklyn.  While de Blasio campaigned for last November's election, the modest home, with its weathered vinyl siding, became a symbol of his claim that he was more in touch with the city's less wealthy residents than his predecessor, billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg, one of the city's wealthiest residents, already owned a mansion on the Upper East Side when he was elected. He continued to live there and at his weekend home in Bermuda for his 12-year tenure rather than move into Gracie Mansion.  De Blasio's Brooklyn house, where he lived until recently with his wife and their teenage son and daughter, has been repainted and has a new dishwasher, refrigerator and microwave oven, according to the listing. Out back there is an herb garden, a patio and a miniature crab apple tree. A spokeswoman declined to say how closely the mayor would get involved in choosing his new tenant. The broker who is handling the rental did not respond to an interview request.
