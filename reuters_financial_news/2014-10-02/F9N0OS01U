NAPLES, Italy, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Following is the text of the European Central Bank's statement on its programme to buy asset-backed securities and covered bonds:

- Programmes will last at least two years  - Will enhance transmission of monetary policy, support provision of credit to the euro area economy and, as a result, provide further monetary policy accommodation - Eurosystem collateral framework is guiding principle for eligibility of assets for purchase  - Asset purchases to start in fourth quarter 2014, starting with covered bonds in second-half of October   The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today agreed key details regarding the operation of its new programmes to buy simple and transparent asset-backed securities (ABSs) and a broad portfolio of euro-denominated covered bonds. Together with the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the purchase programmes will further enhance the transmission of monetary policy. They will facilitate credit provision to the euro area economy, generate positive spill-overs to other markets and, as a result, ease the ECB's monetary policy stance. These measures will have a sizeable impact on the Eurosystem's balance sheet and will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2%.  The Eurosystem's collateral framework - the rules that lay out which assets are acceptable as collateral for monetary policy credit operations - will be the guiding principle for deciding the eligibility of assets to be bought under the ABS purchase programme (ABSPP) and covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3). There will be some adjustments to take into account the difference between accepting assets as collateral and buying assets outright. To ensure that the programmes can include the whole euro area, ABSs and covered bonds from Greece and Cyprus that are currently not eligible as collateral for monetary policy operations will be subject to specific rules with risk-mitigating measures.  The two programmes will last for at least two years and are likely to have a stimulating effect on issuance. Asset purchases will commence in the fourth quarter of 2014, starting with covered bonds in the second half of October. The ABSPP will start after external service providers have been selected, following an ongoing procurement process.  Further to its decision of 4 September 2014 to start an asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided on the following technical modalities of the programme:  - Senior and guaranteed mezzanine tranches of asset-backed securities (ABSs) will be purchased in both primary and secondary markets. -  In order to qualify for purchases under the programme, ABS senior tranches must:  - be eligible under the collateral framework for Eurosystem credit operations as it may be modified over time. For further information on the collateral framework, please see http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/assets/html/index.en.html   - be denominated in euro and have issuer residence within the euro area;  - be secured by claims against non-financial private sector entities resident in the euro area - either legacy or newly originated - of which a minimum share of 95% is euro-denominated and of which a minimum share of 95% are resident in the euro area;  - have a second-best credit assessment of at least CQS3, currently equivalent to an ECAI rating of BBB-/Baa3/BBBl;  - for ABSs with underlying claims against non-financial private sector entities resident in Greece or Cyprus which cannot achieve a second-best credit assessment of CQS3, a derogation based on the fulfilment of the following requirements will be applied for as long as the Eurosystem's minimum credit quality threshold is not applied in the collateral eligibility requirements for marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Cypriot or Greek governments:  i. compliance with the above criteria except the credit quality threshold;  ii. ratings on a second-best basis at the maximum achievable rating in the jurisdiction;  iii. a minimum current credit enhancement of 25%; iv. availability of investor reports and of modelling of the ABSs in standard third party ABS cash-flow modelling tools, as assessed by the ECB;  v. all counterparties to the transaction (e.g. account bank and swap provider), except for the servicer, have a first-best rating of at least CQS3 and full back-up servicing provisions are in place.   - The eligibility criteria for guaranteed mezzanine tranches of ABSs will be communicated at a later stage.   - The Eurosystem will conduct appropriate credit risk and due diligence procedures on the purchasable universe on an ongoing basis.   - The Eurosystem will apply an issue share limit of 70% per ISIN, except in the case of ABSs with underlying claims against non-financial private sector entities resident in Greece or Cyprus and not fulfilling the CQS3 rating requirement; for those ABSs, a corresponding limit of 30% per ISIN will be applied.   - For fully retained securities, purchases by the Eurosystem would be possible subject to some participation by other market investors.
