LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Investment fund assets held worldwide rose 5.2 percent during the second quarter to 25.65 trillion euros ($32.41 trillion), the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) said in a statement.

Net cash inflows fell to 252 billion euros from 292 billion euros, due to a turnaround in net flows of money market funds during the quarter, it said on Thursday. Long-term funds, all funds excluding money market funds, took in 301 billion euros of new money, up from 271 billion euros in the previous quarter, it said.
