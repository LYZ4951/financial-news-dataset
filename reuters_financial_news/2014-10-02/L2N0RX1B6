NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Shares of movie theater companies fell on Thursday, with some down for a third straight session, after Netflix Inc <NFLX.O> announced a film production deal with actor Adam Sandler.

In the deal, Sander will star in and produce four films that will be shown exclusively on Netflix's streaming service, bypassing the theater system. [ID:nL2N0RX12U] Regal Entertainment Group <RGC.N> fell 3 percent to $18.94 while Cinemark Holdings Inc <CNK.N> lost 2.5 percent to $31.72. AMC Entertainment <AMC.N> was unchanged at $22.92. Thursday marked the third straight daily decline for both Regal and Cinemark, with Regal down 5.4 percent over that period and Cinemark off 7.4 percent. The theater chains were also pressured by Netflix earlier this week, when the online movie renter announced its first foray into feature film production, jointly producing the sequel to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" with Weinstein Co. [ID:nL3N0RV68U] Both AMC and Regal said they would not show the film in their theaters.
