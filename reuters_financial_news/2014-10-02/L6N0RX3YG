JOHANNESBURG, Oct 2 (Reuters) - A crackdown by British regulators on payday lender Wonga will have no direct impact on the company's business in South Africa, a spokeswoman for the lender's South African unit said on Thursday.

"All South African customers will need to repay any outstanding loans that they may have," Debbie Sharwood said in a statement, adding Wonga was continuing to tighten its lending criteria in Africa's most advanced economy.
