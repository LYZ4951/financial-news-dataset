VIENNA, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> Chief Executive Karl Sevelda does not expect the Austrian lender to pay a dividend on 2014 results should it report a full-year loss as expected, he said on Thursday.

"From today's perspective I cannot imagine that management will propose a dividend to the annual meeting if there really is a loss," he told reporters on the sidelines of a panel discussion. Emerging Europe's number two lender said last month it could lose as much as 500 million euros ($632 million) this year because of problems in Ukraine and Hungary but then rebound to profit in 2015.
