STOCKHOLM, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The upward trend in private equity transactions is set to continue, the head of major Swedish player Ratos <RATOb.ST> said in a Reuters interview, adding it's chasing its next acquisition even though selling is currently easier than buying.

Ratos, with holdings in 18 Nordic firms, last week added to a growing list of Swedish initial public offerings when it floated window and door maker Inwido <INWI.ST>, the Stockholm bourse main list's eighth IPO this year. [ID:nL6N0RR0V8] With roots dating back to 1866, and with its own listing taking place 60 years ago, Ratos has seen its shares slide by more than 60 percent from their 2011 peak, trading at the same level as during the 2009 financial crisis. Some of the company's holdings face tough challenges despite a global economic recovery, which has forced Ratos to make several capital injections during the last years, putting pressure on its own shares. Ratos' Chief Executive Susanna Campbell said the transaction market continued to improve however, and that industrial and financial players are showing strong interest both in buying and selling assets. "And the stock market is also open in a way that it hasn't been for quite some time. When I look ahead it's my assessment that this will continue to be the case," she said in the interview. Ratos will probably be a net seller of assets in 2014, Campbell said, pointing to the sale of SB Seating in July and the recent listing of Inwido. With its net cash position of almost 4 billion crowns following the transactions, Ratos is now working "extremely hard" to find the right companies to invest in, Campbell said. "But given how we see the business cycle and the market, I think some companies are expensive," she added. Ratos sets a target for each of its investments to reach an average annual return of at least 20 percent, but this had not been achieved by the time it sold SB Seating, in its first exit since 2012. In fact, the return on investment was close to 14 percent for the maker of ergonomic office chairs, and while Campbell said the 20 percent target remains relevant, it is also tough to achieve. "There will be a difference. The companies we invested in in 2007 for example, right before the financial crisis, they will have a hard time reaching 20 percent on average. But hopefully we will do something to compensate for that," she added.  SHARES MUST TURN Among the dark spots in Ratos' portfolio is Norwegian oil services company Aibel, in which the private equity firm bought 50 percent together with Sweden's Sixth AP Fund less than two years ago. Ratos invested 1.7 billion Swedish crowns ($236.50 million) in the company shortly before Aibel's top customer Statoil <STL.OL> announced large investment cuts, putting pressure on profitability and forcing Ratos to inject 32 million Norwegian crowns ($4.96 million) in fresh capital this summer. Ratos' operating profit fell by 13 percent in the first half of the year, not least due to higher restructuring costs among its holdings - primarily at Aibel. Campbell said further measures will be taken this year to ensure that Aibel adapts to lower volumes, but expects  prospects will then improve. "As far as we can see, it's going to be during this autumn that we will make adjustments. Then we hope for it to be over," she said. Adding to Ratos' headaches is the fact that Inwido, in which it still holds 31.3 percent, fell below the offer price of 68 crowns per share following Friday's listing to trade at 63.75 crowns on Thursday.  Campbell said she was disappointed, and that the goal had been for an initial rise following the listing. "We estimated this to be a price from which it could lift a little afterwards. That did not happen and it is really disappointing. So short-term, that is a failure", she said. "I think we will have to judge whether this was a successful or unsuccessful step in (on the bourse) a little later." Ratos has operated as a pure private equity conglomerate for 15 years. Its shares traded at 51.85 crowns on Thursday, slightly above the 49.50 crowns it stood at in March 2009.  Since the company released its third-quarter financial report on Aug 14, the shares have dropped almost 8 percent, compared to a flat development for the Stockholm stock exchange <.OMXSPI>.  Campbell said the share price trend must be turned around, and that the best way to do so will be to focus on Ratos' holdings.
