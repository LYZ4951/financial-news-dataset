SEOUL, Oct 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's finance minister warned on Wednesday that the accelerating decline of the Japanese yen <JPY=> could hurt smaller export companies as monetary policies in various countries diverge.

"The structural issues that have accumulated in our economy have now surfaced as problems as difficult situations persist," said Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan at an event in Seoul.
