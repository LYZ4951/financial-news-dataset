Oct 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> denied a report in the New York Times on Thursday that its computer system had been breached for the second time in about three months.

"The story is false. We are not aware of any new attack,"  JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an email. The New York Times DealBook column, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported that the biggest U.S. bank had found that hackers with links to Italy had gained entry to some of its servers. The attack was discovered recently, the newspaper said.
