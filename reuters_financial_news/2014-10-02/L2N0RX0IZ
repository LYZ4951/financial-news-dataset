NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Motors Inc <TSLA.O> was one of the biggest movers of Thursday's premarket session, after the company's chief executive hinted at a new product that would be unveiled next week.

Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company, wrote on Twitter that it was "about time to unveil the D and something else."  An image that accompanied the tweet suggested the unveiling might include a new vehicle model.[ID:nL3N0RX0QH] Shares were up 3 percent to $247.50 before the bell.
