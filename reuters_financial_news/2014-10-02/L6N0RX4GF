LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - European shares fell sharply on Thursday, with Italy's FTSE MIB share index <.FTMIB> recording its biggest daily percentage drop in 18 months, after the European Central Bank gave less details about its plan to buy secured debt than the market had expected.

ECB President Mario Draghi said the central bank would begin to buy covered bonds (CB), a form of secured debt, from banks in mid-October and purchase asset-backed securities (ABS) at some point in the fourth quarter of the year. [ID:L6N0RX19G] "Draghi confirmed that purchases will take place at least over the next two years, but disappointed investors by not confirming the size of purchases. Overall, today's ECB meeting confirms that governing council is now in wait and see mode," Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders, said.
