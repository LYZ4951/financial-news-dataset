BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Pierre Moscovici, the EU economy commissioner-designate, said on Thursday that the issue of Eurobonds - a way of sharing state debt liabilities in the euro zone - was unlikely to be discussed in the next five years.

Answering questions at a parliamentary confirmation hearing, the former French finance minister said: "The time for Eurobonds is not upon us yet." He added that he thought it was unlikely to be on the table during his five-year mandate. Germany and some northern allies fear that Eurobonds, backed by all euro zone states collectively, would mean an increase in the very low borrowing costs they currently enjoy.
