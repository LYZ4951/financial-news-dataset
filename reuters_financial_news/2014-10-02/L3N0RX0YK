Oct 2 (Reuters) - U.S. federal and state authorities are investigating used-car dealerships to examine if they are inflating borrowers' income or falsifying employment information on loan applications to ensure that anyone can buy a car, the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter.

Falsified loan applications may lead borrowers to ultimately fall behind on their repayments and that could spell trouble for investors such as insurance companies and public pension funds, the newspaper said.

It is not known how many subprime auto loans have been made on the basis of falsified applications.
