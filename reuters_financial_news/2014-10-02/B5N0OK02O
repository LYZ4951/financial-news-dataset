BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Pierre Moscovici, the former French finance minister nominated as EU economy commissioner, told his confirmation hearing on Thursday that he would use room for manoeuvre in EU budget rules to foster growth.

"You cannot cut the deficit if you don't have economic growth," he said. "As commissioner I would be there to safeguard the rules and use the room for manoeuvre within the rules."
