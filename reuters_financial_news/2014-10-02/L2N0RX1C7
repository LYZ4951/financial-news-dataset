NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - A former executive of Foundry Networks Inc was found guilty on Thursday of leaking inside information about the data-equipment maker that enabled a San Francisco hedge fund to earn millions of dollars.

David Riley, Foundry's former chief information officer, was found guilty by a federal jury in Manhattan of two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy, after a trial that lasted more than three weeks. A mistrial was declared on a fourth count on which jurors were deadlocked. The verdict brought to 83 the number of people who have been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty since October 2009 amid a years-long campaign against insider trading by the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. It marked a rebound for Bharara's office, after its winning streak in insider-trading trials was broken in July with the acquittal of Rengan Rajaratnam, a younger brother of convicted Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam.
