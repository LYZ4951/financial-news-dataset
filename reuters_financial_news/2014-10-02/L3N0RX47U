Oct 2 (Reuters) - Turkish conglomerate Anadolu Group has offered to buy a 40.25 percent stake in supermarket chain Migros <MGROS.IS> from BC Partners [BCPRT.UL], the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing a notification on the Borsa Istanbul stock exchange.

Anadolu offered 26 lira per share ($11.475), a premium of 36 percent to Migros's closing price on Thursday. This would put the market capitalization of the company at 3.4 billion lira, the report said. (http://www.ft.com/fastft?post=215372) The offer was made by Anadolu Industry, the holding company of the group, the FT reported. London-based BC Partners, a private equity group, which owns about 80 percent of Migros, has been in informal talks to sell the chain for many years, but a slowdown in the Turkish economy and fall in value of lira against the dollar has made it difficult to do so, the newspaper reported. The notification was issued by a holding company for BC Partners' stake in Migros which said that both the sides were in talks, the FT reported. BC Partners had bought Migros in 2008 for $3.25 billion with the help of Turkey's Turkven and Italy's DeA Capital <DEA.MI>, beating a bid by larger rival Blackstone <BX.N> and Croatian food group Agrokor.
