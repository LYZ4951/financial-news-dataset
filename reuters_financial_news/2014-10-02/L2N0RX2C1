NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC is exploring a sale that could fetch more than $1 billion for the privately-held specialty drugmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.

Atlanta, Georgia-based Arbor, which makes prescription drugs for cardiovascular, hospital and pediatric markets, is working with JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N> on the potential sale, the people with knowledge of the situation said on Thursday, asking not to be named because the discussions are private. Arbor joins a number of healthcare companies considering a sale at a time when robust buyout appetite from pharmaceutical and biotech companies is driving deal volumes to their highest levels in several years. Representatives for Arbor could not be immediately reached for comment, while JPMorgan declined to comment. The company has branded and generic prescription products for specialty focused conditions in various stages of development, and has 280 sales professionals, according to its website.
