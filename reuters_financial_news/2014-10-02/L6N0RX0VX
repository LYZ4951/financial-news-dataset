DUBAI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The Dubai Financial Market could see one more company list on the stock exchange before the end of the year, in addition to the already-announcing share sale by a healthcare and education start-up, its chairman said on Thursday.

"It is possible that we will have one more listing before the end of the year," Essa Kazim told reporters at an event to mark the commencement of trading of Emaar Malls Group, which completed a $1.58 billion initial share sale last month.
