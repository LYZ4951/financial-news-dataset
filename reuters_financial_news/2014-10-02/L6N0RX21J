MOSCOW, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday the government would help companies hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine and that it would increase the capital of domestic banks.

"The government is prepared to support sectors and companies that have been hit by unwarranted foreign sanctions. This would include helping them raise capital. First and foremost, I mean financial institutions," he told the VTB Russia Calling investment conference.
