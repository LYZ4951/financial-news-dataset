LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The UK Independence Party, which wants Britain to leave the European Union, has claimed a boost in its campaign to upset British politics after a businessman pledged to give the party a donation of 1 million pounds(1.62 million US dollar).

Insurance entrepreneur Arron Brook originally planned to give 100,000 pounds to UKIP but he said he would raise the donation ten-fold after a comment by William Hague, a senior Conservative Party member, who called him a "nobody."
