BUDAPEST, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's ruling party will first discuss a bill that will set out the rules for fair banking on Nov. 4, when the party will also start discussions on a planned conversion of foreign currency loans into forints, a senior Fidesz lawmaker said.

Antal Rogan, head of the party's parliamentary group, also said on Thursday that he has written a letter to the President of the Republic Janos Ader urging him to sign off on a law passed in parliament last month that forces banks to pay refunds to borrowers on past loans.
