BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Pierre Moscovici, the former French finance minister nominated as EU economy commissioner, told his confirmation hearing on Thursday that he would "act as a European" and apply EU budget rules to France as he would to any other state.

"Any country, large or small, if it does not take effective action as required, I will follow the necessary procedures," he said in answer to a question about whether he would be ready to penalise his French Socialist allies for breaking deficit limits set for countries in the euro zone.
