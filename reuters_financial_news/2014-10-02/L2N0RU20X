Oct 2 (Reuters) - The number of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil fell in the first nine months of the year as the impact of a recession, dwindling confidence and political uncertainty delayed the conclusion of some deals, bankers said.

The number of transactions fell to 375 in the January to September period from 452 a year earlier, although the total deal value jumped 46 percent to $50.24 billion, a Thomson Reuters report on M&A activity showed.
