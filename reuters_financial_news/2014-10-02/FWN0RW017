FRANKFURT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - German industrial services and building firm Bilfinger <GBFG.DE> said on Thursday its supervisory board Chairman Bernhard Walter would step down next month to allow shareholder Cevian to assume a second seat on the board.

The move comes days after Swedish activist investor Cevian raised its stake in Bilfinger to 25.6 percent. [ID:nWEA00G22]
