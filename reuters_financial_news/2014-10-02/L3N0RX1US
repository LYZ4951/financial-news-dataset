BANGKOK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Indonesia's key index posted its biggest one-day percentage drop in nearly six months on Thursday due to concerns about the ability of the incoming government to enforce reforms, while Thai benchmark hit an over two-week closing low after data showed weak consumer confidence.

Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> finished down 2.7 percent at 5,000.80. Foreign selling hit large caps such as Astra International <ASII.JK>, Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> and Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK>. Sentiment was hit after the ruling coalition, led by president-elect Joko Widodo's party, lost the parliament head election to the opposition, led by losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto's party, brokers said. [ID:nL3N0RU49W] Jakarta-based Reza Priyambada, head of research Woori Korindo Securities Indonesia said the political concern came on top of a negative trading in Asian market. "Investors are questioning whether Joko Widodo can run an effective government if his programs have to be brought to such a tough opposition in parliament," Priyambada said. In Bangkok, investors cashed in on recent gainers such as Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> and Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK>, sending the key SET index <.SETI> 1.1 percent lower at 1,569.73, the lowest since Sept. 16. Consumer confidence in Thailand dropped in September for the first time since the military coup in May, a university survey showed, adding to evidence that authorities have not yet been able to get an economic recovery on track. [ID:nL3N0RX0LR] Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI>, Malaysia <.KLSE> and the Philippines <.PSI> ended down, in line with Asian peers after a slew of weak global manufacturing data. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was down 0.3 percent. [MKTS/GLOB]
