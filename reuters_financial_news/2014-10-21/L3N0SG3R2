MUMBAI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose for a third straight session on Tuesday to mark their highest close in 1-1/2 weeks as coal-related stocks such as Jindal Steel and Power <JNSP.NS> surged on the government's plans to auction coal blocks the top court cancelled in August.

India promised on Monday to open up the coal industry to private players and moved closer to selling a stake in a state-run oil company, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi picked up the pace on economic reform days after relaxing fuel price controls.

"We are bullish on the market for the next one year, largely due to the reforms initiated by the government and due to falling inflation," said Dipen Shah, head of private client group research at Kotak Securities. "The valuations should improve in the coming few months." The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose 0.55 percent, or 145.80 points, to end at 26,575.65.
