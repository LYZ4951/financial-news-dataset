LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - If the U.S. and Japanese experience is anything to go by, the prospect of the European Central Bank buying corporate bonds, in an attempt to stimulate lending within the euro zone, will hit the euro.

The ECB is considering buying corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the matter as soon as December, several sources told Reuters. [ID:nL6N0SG1Z0] If the proposal gets the green light, the ECB could begin buying the bonds, a market the central bank itself estimates amounts to more than 1.4 trillion euros, early next year. Traders' initial reaction to that prospect was to push the euro down half a percent against the dollar, and that could be just a foretaste of things to come. [FRX/]  In the absence of domestic demand, when a central bank opens the spigots and pumps more and more money into the local economy, that money tends to seek alternative destinations that offer better returns. Though the U.S. Federal Reserve would probably dispute it, traders and indeed many emerging market finance ministers, would see a linkage between the early rounds of Fed-led quantitative easing and a weakening dollar. [ID:nL2N0HE26G] The Fed's asset purchase programmes released trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy. But, unable to find decent returns at home, those dollars went globetrotting in search of higher yields, weighing down on the greenback's external value as they were converted into foreign currencies for investment. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy has also been characterised in recent years by significant asset purchase programmes, intended to stimulate domestic economic activity and ignite inflation, but resulting in a weaker yen as a "side effect". With a surfeit of yen but weak loan demand at home, Japan's main banks have opted for aggressive overseas expansion, and that has led to a ballooning of their foreign currency-denominated loans. [ID:nL4N0Q02XO] That has been part of the narrative behind the yen's weakness on the foreign exchange market.  PAPERWEIGHT There is no reason why, if the European Central Bank decides to buy corporate paper, the result will be any different. The euros injected into the system by ECB purchases of corporate bonds would probably leak out of the currency bloc and head elsewhere. Why would investors expect returns in a euro zone with deep-rooted economic problems and where ultra-easy ECB monetary policy has made yields on euro deposits negligible at best? It is far more likely that the euros end up, at least partly, being converted into foreign currencies and invested in economies that offer better returns, just as arguably was the Japanese and U.S. experience.
