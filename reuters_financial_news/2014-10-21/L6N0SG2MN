LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Castle Harbour, a boutique London-based financial services firm, said on Tuesday it had hired ex-Deutsche Bank fund manager Damien Regnier to co-manage a new 200 million euros ($255.22 million) convertible bond fund.

The R&D - Pure Global Convertibles Fund is expected to launch in the fourth quarter, Castle Harbour said in a statement, and will follow a similar strategy to Regnier's previous fund. "He will adopt the same 'pure' non-benchmarked, investment-grade strategy focused on institutional investors that he developed at DeAWM," Castle Harbour said in a statement.
