FRANKFURT, Oct 21 (Reuters) - German engineering group Siemens <SIEGn.DE> is in advanced talks to sell its hearing-aids business for more than 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), two people familiar with the matter said.

Siemens this year announced plans to list its audiology unit, but declining equity markets have made such a move less attractive. Sources told Reuters in August the group was renewing efforts to divest the unit. [ID:nL6N0QJ3FZ] Private-equity firm EQT Partners AB is the frontrunner in the sales negotiations, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. A deal could be reached within the next few weeks, it said. Siemens and EQT declined to comment.
