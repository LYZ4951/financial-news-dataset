MOSCOW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Tuesday it had conducted 8.63 billion roubles ($210 million) worth of forex interventions to defend the rouble on Oct 17.

The central bank releases its interventions data with a time lag. The rouble <RUB=> has been sliding on falling oil prices and broad risk aversion towards Russia because of its role in the Ukraine crisis.
