MADRID, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Spanish nationalised lender Bankia <BKIA.MC> is expected to report on Friday a 86 percent rise in nine-month net profit from a year ago, continuing to restore its balance sheet after billions of euros in state aid in 2012.

Five analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast average net profit for the nine months to September of 673 million euros, boosted by cost-cutting, capital gains from stake sales and lower provisions as bad loans come under control. Following are the results of the poll in simple averages and millions of euros.
