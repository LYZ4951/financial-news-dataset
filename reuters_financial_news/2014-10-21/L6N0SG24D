OSLO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Norwegian insurance company Gjensidige <GJFS.OL> reported third quarter results below forecasts, mainly due to weather related damages, but CEO Helge Leiro Baastad sees a positive trend despite intense competition and a challenging rate level.[ID:nFWN0SG005]

The following are comments from chief executive Helge Leiro Baastad to Reuters after the presentation:  ON WHY RESULT IS WEAKER THAN EXPECTED: "We are satisfied with a pretax profit of nearly NOK 1.4 billion and a combined ratio of 85.5, but compared to the exceptionally good result in the same quarter last year, it is off course a little weaker. "The result was negatively affected by more claims relating to thunder and lightning and the proportion of large losses was somewhat higher. "The overall level of large losses was nonetheless lower than we normally expect. Long term we expect this level to be around 5.1 percent with the current portfolio, and for the third quarter it was 3.8 percent. "The financial result in the quarter was satisfactory given the challenging interest rate situation.  "Housing products are especially volatile, and it is becoming increasingly expensive to compensate for damages to houses and cars.  "A top priority now is to ensure that the premiums are well adjusted, without losing volume. The competition is intense, but we feel we are in a good trend.  ON CONSOLIDATION
