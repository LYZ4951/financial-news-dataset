BUCHAREST, Oct 21 (Reuters) - European Central Bank financial stress tests should not reveal any surprises for the Romanian banking system, the Bucharest central bank's governor Mugur Isarescu said on Tuesday, despite funding from the West having fallen.

Isarescu told reporters funding from foreign banks for their Romanian affiliates had fallen by 9 billion euros over the past five years.
