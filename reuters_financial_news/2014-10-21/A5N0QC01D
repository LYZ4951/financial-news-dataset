PRAGUE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - External risks to the Czech economy, mainly the situation in the euro zone and also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have been on the rise in recent weeks, Czech central bank Governor Miroslav Singer said on Tuesday.

The economy is on a path towards balanced and faster growth, but could be held back by those external factors, he said in a presentation to students released on the bank's website. He said a recession in the euro zone would be a bigger risk than impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, unless the situation in the latter case deteriorates into extreme scenarios. External risks were on the downside for both inflation and growth, Singer said.
