MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> opened down 0.9 percent on Tuesday as Italy's third largest lender continues to remain under pressure on concerns a European banking review may unveil fresh capital shortfalls.

"The stock will probably remain higly volatile until the results of the (ECB's) comprehensive assesment are known," ICBPI analyst Luca Comi, who has a neutral rating and 1.70 euro price target on the stock, said in a morning note. By 0708 GMT, the stock was down 0.4 percent at 0.832 euros. The European banking stocks index <.SX7P> was down 0.3 percent.  Further clouding the picture is a report in Italian newspaper La Repubblica which said the European Central Bank could ask from next month that Monte dei Paschi books its Alexandria and Santorini derivative deals at market value, generating new losses of nearly 600 million euros.
