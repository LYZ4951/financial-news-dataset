MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities have detained the chief executive of oil services company Oceanografia [OCNGR.UL], which is at the center of a fraud probe involving Citigroup Inc's <C.N> local unit Banamex.

Amado Yanez was detained late on Monday, a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. It was unclear what charges he was facing. Oceanografia is at the center of a loan scandal that cost Citigroup more than $500 million, after the bank said it uncovered bogus loans to Oceanografia at Banamex. Oceanografia was a top service provider to state-run oil giant Pemex [PEMX.UL] over the past decade, winning billions of dollars in contracts. The company is now in bankruptcy proceedings.
