COPENHAGEN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank said on Tuesday it planned to outsource the printing of banknotes and minting of coins from 2016 and it expected to save 100 million crowns ($17.2 million) from it in the 2016 to 2020 period.

"Underlying demand for new banknotes and coins has been declining for several years, and the Nationalbank doesn't expect the trend to change," it said in a statement. At end of 2013, the value of banknotes and coins in circulation in Denmark was 65.8 billion crowns. The number of banknotes in circulation declined to 164 million from 166 million in 2012.
