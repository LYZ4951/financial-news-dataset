BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators are set to fine JPMorgan <JPM.N>, UBS <UBSN.VX> and Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> collectively over $115 million for rigging Swiss franc LIBOR benchmark interest rates, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> alerted the European Commission to the wrongdoing and so would not be penalised for its own role in the cartel, the source said on Tuesday.  JPMorgan will receive the biggest fine at just over 70 million euros ($89 million), the person said. Details are likely to be released following an agreement on the fines by the European Commission at its weekly meeting, currently under way.
