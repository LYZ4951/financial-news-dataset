WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. home resales jumped to their highest level in a year in September, the latest indication that the housing market recovery is gradually getting back on track.

The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday existing home sales rose 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.17 million units, the strongest reading since September of last year.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising to a 5.10 million unit pace last month from August's 5.05 million unit pace. Sales, however, were down 1.7 percent compared to September of last year.
