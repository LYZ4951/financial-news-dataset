SINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's Keppel Corporation Ltd <KPLM.SI> said its third-quarter net profit fell 9 percent on the year to S$414 million ($325.8 million), weighed down by a lacklustre performance at its property division.

The property division's pretax profit for the quarter fell 37 percent to S$198 million, while offshore and marine segment recorded a 27 percent gain, Keppel said in a statement on Tuesday.  [ID:nSNZ9X6Xxc]
