LJUBLJANA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Slovenia's state-owned bank asset management company said it issued a state-guaranteed 3-year bond valued at 424.6 million euros ($544.72 million) with an interest rate of 1.5 percent.

The bank, which manages the bad loans of Slovenia's state-owned banks, exchanged the bond for bad loans taken over from state-owned lender Abanka Vipa. The bad bank was set up last year to ease the overhaul of the country's banking system.
