BANGKOK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's stock index hit a more than one week high on Tuesday, helped by selective buying in a reporting season while the Indonesian benchmark snapped two sessions of gains as investors waited for the formation of the country's new cabinet.

The Straits Times index <.FTSTI> was up 0.7 percent at 3,202.74, the highest close since Oct. 10, extending gain for a third session. Shares of Keppel Corporation <KPLM.SI> rose 0.9 percent, among actively-traded stocks. Keppel, the world's largest jackup rig builder, reported after market close that its third-quarter net profit fell 9 percent on the year to S$414 million ($325.8 million), weighed down by a lacklustre performance at its property division.[ID:nL3N0SG3M3] Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> finished down 0.22 percent, reversing from a near three-week closing high on Monday. New Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Tuesday he was re-evaluating some of his choices for cabinet jobs after an anti-graft agency raised concern about possible problems with some candidates.
