MILAN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> rose nearly nine percent after a string of recent losses as investors took a more upbeat view about the outcome for the lender of a European banking review.

Italy's third-biggest lender saw its share price rebound 8.8 percent at 1220 GMT to trade around 0.90 euros apiece, recovering from a string of recent losses which were due to expectations the review would uncover a capital shortfall.
