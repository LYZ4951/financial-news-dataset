Oct 21 (Reuters) - Discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp <ETFC.O> reported an 83 percent rise in third-quarter profit, helped by a surge in trading activity and a drop in provisions for bad loans.

The company's net income rose to $86 million, or 29 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $47 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. [ID:nBw8D7bMsa]
