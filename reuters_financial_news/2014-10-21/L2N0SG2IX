NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. banks and other lenders will make 7 percent more home loans in 2015 than 2014 as an improving job market and low interest rates should stoke home purchases and demand for loans to buy them, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Tuesday.

The Washington-based industry group forecast overall mortgage originations will increase to $1.19 trillion next year, led by a 15 percent increase in purchase loans to $731 billion. The anticipated increase for purchase mortgages would more than offset a modest 3 percent decline in mortgage refinancing, which will total $457 billion in 2015, MBA said.
