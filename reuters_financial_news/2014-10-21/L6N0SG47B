MADRID, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Bankinter <BKT.MC> will kick of Spanish banks' quarterly reporting season on Thursday with growth in net profit thanks to fewer provisions from a year ago, stabilising financial margins and increased control over bad loans.

Six analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast average net profit for the nine months to September of 209 million euros, up 34 percent from a year earlier. Bankinter was the least exposed of Spanish banks to a devastating property crash in 2008 and, unlike peers, posted loan growth in the first half of this year. Following are the results of the poll in simple averages and millions of euros.
