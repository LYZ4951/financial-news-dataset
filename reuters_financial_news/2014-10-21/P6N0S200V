PARIS, Oct 21 (Reuters) - European shares fell in early trading on Tuesday, adding to the previous session's losses as data showing a slowdown in Chinese economic growth kept investors on edge, offsetting better-than-expected quarterly sales from Apple <AAPL.O>.

Shares in oil giant Total <TOTF.PA> fell 1.2 percent after its chief executive Christophe de Margerie was killed when a business jet collided with a snow plough during takeoff at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport. [ID:nL2N0SG00D] At 0703 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,270.57 points, after losing 0.6 percent on Monday.
