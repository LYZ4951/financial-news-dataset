ABU DHABI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank <ADCB.AD> will open a representative office in Singapore this year as part of its plans to expand in southeast Asia, the bank said on Saturday.

The fourth-largest lender in the United Arab Emirates by assets has obtained approval for the office from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, it said. ADCB launched a representative office in London five months ago, and has two branches in India.
