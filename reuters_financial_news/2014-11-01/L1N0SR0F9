BUENOS AIRES, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Argentina has received bids worth $2.2 billion in an auction for third-generation (3G) and fourth-generation (4G) licenses, the government said on Saturday, part of a push to improve cellular telephone and internet services in the South American country.

The amount bid for the communications frequency licenses was 14 percent above the $1.97 billion minimum set by the government for the auction. Bidders included Movistar, a unit of Spain's Telefonica <TEF.MC>, Personal, controlled by Telecom Argentina <TEC2.BA>; Claro, owned by Mexican group America Movil <AMXL.MX>; and Airlink. Details of the offers will be made public later this month when the auction results are announced, according to a statement from the government.
