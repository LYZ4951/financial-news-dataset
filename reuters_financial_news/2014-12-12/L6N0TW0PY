LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Two former UBS Group AG <UBSG.VX> bankers are preparing to start a global cross-asset, long-biased hedge fund in January to bet on out-of-favour companies and events such as mergers and acquisitions and spin-offs.

Laurent Constanty and Fabien Baetz, both former executive directors at the fixed income solutions group of the Swiss bank, will launch the Reaching Value and Opportunities Fund with about $20 million, most of which is their own money. The fund aims to raise 100 million euros ($124.6 million)and generate 15 percent annual gains through investments in stocks, bonds and other securities, Constanty and Baetz told Reuters. The launch comes at a tough time for the industry, with hedge funds gaining just under 5 percent on average through November this year, data from tracker Eurekahedge showed, and as big investors continue to show a preference for larger funds.
