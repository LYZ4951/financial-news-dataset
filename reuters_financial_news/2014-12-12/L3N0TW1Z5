JAKARTA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank has warned firms against holding unhedged offshore loans as the rupiah slides to its weakest level since 2008, senior deputy governor said on Friday.

Bank Indonesia's senior deputy governor Mirza Adityaswara said the depreciation of rupiah <IDR=ID>, which in December fell more than 2 percent, was fair. The rupiah was traded at 12,445 per dollar at 0556 GMT on Friday.
