SOFIA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Bulgarian finance minister said on Friday that ratings agency Standard & Poor's had missed some positive developments in the country in its latest downgrade and that S&P would soon have reasons to revise its rating.

S&P cut Bulgaria's sovereign credit rating to below investment grade at BB+, compared with its previous BBB- rating, as the fallout from the Balkan country's worst financial crisis since the 1990s continues to bite. "The rating agency has not taken into account some positive results are already a fact," Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said in a statement.
