SYDNEY, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Australia's securities market regulator on Friday asked for complete and better disclosure of costs for investment products available in pension funds after a government-backed inquiry called for more efficiency in the $1.6 trillion system.

The move is aimed to improve the quality of disclosure by funds and allow consumers to make informed decisions, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) said in a statement. Australia's pioneering so-called 'super industry' - bigger than the country's annual economic output - provides more than A$72 billion a year in retirement funds, double the regular federal pension. And it is held up as a model for other developed countries. But the industry is plagued by high fees and a narrow range of products for retirees to invest their savings in. Coupled with poor spending decisions by retirees - who often cash in their 'super' and splash out on holidays and cars - it has meant more Australians are outliving their investments.

"These benefits have been offset by higher costs elsewhere in the system rather than being reflected in lower fees." ASIC's order will apply to all product disclosure statements for superannuation and investment products from Jan. 1, it said in a statement.
