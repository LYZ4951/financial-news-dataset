PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French food group Danone <DANO.PA> is keeping hold of its medical nutrition business, a top Danone executive told Reuters on Friday.

Board secretary Laurent Sacchi made the comments after Danone issued a statement saying each of the group's core businesses had a role to play in the French group's strategy.  "We are keeping this business," Sacchi said.
