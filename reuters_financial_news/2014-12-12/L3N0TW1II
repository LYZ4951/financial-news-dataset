BANGKOK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Thailand's Quality Houses PCL <QH.BK> said on Friday it aimed for revenue growth of 20 percent in 2015 as the developer plans to book higher income from condominium projects amid improving sentiment in the overall property market.

Quality Houses plans to launch 30 new housing projects worth a combined 40 billion baht ($1.22 billion) next year and spend about 6 billion baht to buy land, senior executive vice president Suwanna Bhuddhaprasart told reporters.
