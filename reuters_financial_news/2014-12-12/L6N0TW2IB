COPENHAGEN, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Danish crown <EURDKK=D3> has strengthened to its highest level in two years on Friday after the European Central Bank's (ECB) second offer of loans drew tepid interest.

The lack on interest in the ECB's offer has prompted expectations of additional monetary policy measures from the ECB which has driven euro area money market rates lower, widening the spread against the Danish equivalent.
