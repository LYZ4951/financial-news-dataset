STOCKHOLM, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Window and door maker Inwido <INWI.ST> is looking to buy companies in the central parts of Europe, its top chief said on Friday, adding that while most savings measures have been completed there will probably be more restructuring ahead.

Inwido, floated by investment firm Ratos <RATOb.ST> in September, has large market shares in its three top markets Sweden, Finland and Denmark after numerous acquisitions, but sees "endless" opportunities to improve its market share in Europe, Chief Executive Hakan Jeppsson told Reuters. He said Inwido was looking primarily within the "wood belt" - from Slovenia, Switzerland, Austria, southern Germany and northern Italy and across to the United Kingdom - where the market for wooden products is comparatively large. "We know who they are, and we know pretty well what we want to do," Jeppsson said, adding he prefers to buy companies with sales of more than 100 million Swedish crowns ($13.2 million). "To go to Bavaria just to buy a company of 8 million (in sales) - it's just too much work. There has to be some substance."  Jeppsson said raising its market shares in Sweden and Finland, where it is already a dominant player, would be tough. In Norway and Denmark however, the company could grow both structurally and organically. Inwido, which works under 20 different brands in Europe such as Elitfonster and ERA, has undergone several efficiency improvements in recent years, cutting staff to roughly 3,000 from 4,500 six years ago.  Jeppsson said there was more to be done ahead both structurally and on Inwido's product range, but no decisions had been made on further cuts, and the company was currently focusing on growth.  "We still have 26 plants. I don't think there will be that many in five years."  SHARES DOWN AFTER IPO Jeppsson said the company's forecast of 2-3 percent average market growth next year in the Nordic countries was still valid, even if the Finnish and Norwegian markets looked a bit uncertain. Inwido has an operating margin (EBITA) target of 12 percent. In the first nine months of the year, it reached a little over 9 percent. To reach the margin goal, handling the seasonally very weak first quarter is key, according to Jeppsson. He said with the current portfolio and efficiency, and with market growth of 2-3 percent, it would take a few years. "Whether it'll be in 2016, 2017 or the beginning of 2018 - it's hard to say. We are somewhat depending on the market not dying again." The Inwido share has fallen 6 percent from its offer price of 68 Swedish crowns, to trade at 64 crowns on Friday.[ID:nL6N0RR0V8] Jeppsson said that on and around Sept 26, the share's first day of trading, markets became turbulent, and the Inwido share went with the flow and got stuck at lower levels. "It feels as if we have a lower valuation than many similar businesses, and I'm not quite sure of the reason for that. I suppose it's more a question of the time it will take (for the market) to gain confidence in the company." "There is nothing this far which we haven't delivered on." Private equity firm Ratos still holds roughly 31 percent of the shares.  Inwido, whose customers are mainly consumers while a smaller part are construction companies, is generally helped by warm weather. Jeppsson said the whole year had probably been affected by unusually high temperatures, including this winter so far in the Nordic countries.
