LJUBLJANA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Slovenia's economy should grow by 2.5 percent this year and 1.75 percent in 2015, the International Monetary Fund said on Friday after completing a regular mission to the euro zone country that narrowly avoided an international bailout last year.

Delia Velculescu, the head of the Fund's mission, said Slovenia should press on with pension reform and with plans to sell state-owned banks, which almost collapsed under bad loans last year.
