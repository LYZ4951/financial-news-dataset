FRANKFURT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has given initial endorsement to the plans of 13 banks to address capital shortfalls discovered in recent health checks, it said on Friday.

"The Supervisory Board today endorsed the last set of capital plans from the banks where the comprehensive assessment detected a capital shortfall," a spokesman said in a statement.  "The outcome will feed into the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process decisions, which is subject to no objection from the Governing Council," he said.  "At that point, all 13 banks with remaining capital shortfalls have six or nine months (depending on its origin) to cover the shortfalls and implement their plans."
