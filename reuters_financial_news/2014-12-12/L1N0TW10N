NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. prime money market funds' holdings in U.S. Treasuries decreased 13 percent to $54 billion at November to the lowest level in nearly two years due to tight Treasury bill supply and higher yields offered by competing debt, J.P. Morgan analysts said on Friday.

Prime money market funds invest in commercial paper, bank deposits and other private debt in addition to U.S. government securities. Meanwhile, U.S. money funds' holdings of fixed-rate reverse repurchase agreements or reverse repos (RRP) offered by the Federal Reserve fell by $8 billion last month, the analysts said in a report released on Friday. Fed has been testing reverse repos where it pays money funds, Wall Street dealers and mortgage finance agencies interest to borrow its Treasuries.
