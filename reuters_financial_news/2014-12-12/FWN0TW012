VIENNA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Austrian property group Conwert <CONW.VI> has agreed to sell its entire Czech portfolio and most of its assets in Slovakia as it sharpens its focus on Germany and Austria, it said on Friday.

The combined transaction volume is 48.5 million euros ($60 million), in line with the amounts on Conwert's books, it said without naming the local buyers. "With the sale of this major part of the portfolio in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, we have achieved a very significant step in streamlining the portfolio in Eastern Europe in 2014," Chief Executive Clemens Schneider said in a statement.
