KAMPALA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> inched down on Friday due to demand for dollars from companies in the energy sector, and traders said it had a stable outlook after the central bank held its key lending rate.

At 1203 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,765/2,775, compared with Thursday's close of 2,760/2,770. "The market has seen significant demand from energy sector firms," said Faisal Bukenya, head of market making at Barclays Bank. The shilling is down 8.8 percent this year.  A trader from a leading commercial bank said it should trade on a stable footing in the medium term after the central bank kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged on Friday. [ID:nL6N0TW19U]
