MUMBAI, Dec 12 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell for a fifth session in six on Friday to post its worst weekly loss since July as oil explorers continued to slump after Brent crude prices slipped to below $63 a barrel.

The broader NSE index <.NSEI> closed down 0.8 percent. For the week it lost 3.7 percent for its worst weekly performance since mid-July. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally ended 0.9 percent lower.
