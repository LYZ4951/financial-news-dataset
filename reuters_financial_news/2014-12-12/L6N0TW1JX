LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to Russian debt rose to a 5-1/2-year high on Friday, according to data from financial information provider Markit.

Russia's 5-year credit default swaps (CDS) rose 18 basis points from Thursday's close to 442 basis points, Markit said. Bonds also sold off, with dollar debt spreads over U.S. Treasuries as well as local 10-year yields surging to levels last seen in 2009. <.JPMEGRUSR> <RU10YT=RR>. The move comes as Russia's rouble dropped to a new low below 57 against the dollar, continuing a slide that traders said on Friday prompted the central bank to intervene to defend the currency after a rate rise on Thursday failed to halt its decline.
