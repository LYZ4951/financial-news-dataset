MOSCOW, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Thursday it had conducted 11.18 billion roubles ($197.44 million) worth of forex market interventions on Dec. 10 to prop up the rouble.

This follows $348 million in interventions on Dec. 9 and around $4.5 billion in interventions last week to support the Russian currency, despite the central bank floating the rouble in November.
