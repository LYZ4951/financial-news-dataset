The Debt and Asset Trading Corporation (DATC) is one of the government's tools to help unload bad debts and unused assets, mostly in state-owned enterprises which take up half of Vietnam's loans but contribute to only a third of its $170 billion economy. The move comes as "equitisation", the Vietnamese phrase for privatisation, is still far below target. Only 71 of 432 SOEs have been reformed ahead of the 2015 deadline. Vietnam has also been battling high levels of non-performing loans that have hurt the property market and stifled efforts to boost private sector businesses and stimulate credit growth, but the economy has shown signs of stabilisation.
