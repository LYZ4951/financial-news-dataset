MUMBAI, Dec 12 (Reuters) - India has capped the prices of 52 more drugs, including painkillers and antibiotics, the pricing authority said in a notice.

The additional drugs join a list of nearly 400 essential medicines that have so far been placed under price control in India, where a majority of the people live on under $2 a day and health insurance is scarce. The new drugs to come under price control include commonly-used antibiotics and painkillers as well as medicines used for treating cancer and skin disorders, a notice on the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority website said. Companies including Lupin Ltd <LUPN.NS>, Cadila Healthcare Ltd <CADI.NS> and Merck Ltd <MERK.NS> - the Indian arm of the U.S. firm Merck & Co Inc <MRK.N> - are among those selling drugs mentioned in the latest notice, the authority said.
