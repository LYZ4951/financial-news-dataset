SHANGHAI, Dec 12 (Reuters) - China's money market rates rose this week, buoyed by seasonal demand at year-end and by how investors prepared to make bids for a series of coming initial public offerings, traders said.

The rise following late November's unexpected official interest rate cut reflected how liquidity conditions remained relatively tight due to reduced supply, thanks to lower bank deposits and other factors. "The market's fragile ability to handle seasonal cash-calls reflects liquidity has far from reached the level that will enable a lowering of funding costs pledged by regulators," said a dealer at a major Chinese state-owned bank in Shanghai. "This market reality is unlikely to change much, at least in the coming couple months unless the central bank cuts banks' required reserve ratios (RRR)." The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day repo rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> was up 23 basis points at 3.65 percent by midday compared with the close last Friday. Another active contract, the 14-day rate <CN14DRP=CFXS>, jumped 36 basis points compared with the Dec. 5 close, to 4.31 percent. The rates are likely to remain high next week as companies withdraw money from banks to pay annual bonuses while banks need more cash to polish their books for year-end, traders said. In addition, 12 IPOs will be launched on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in the next two weeks. Traders estimate these will tie up more than 1 trillion yuan ($163 billion) of subscription money for a few days.  RRR CUT LOOMING? People's Bank of China BOC data showed deposits at Chinese banks dropped by 186.6 billion yuan ($30 billion) in October, due mainly to new rules capping banks' end-month bank deposits. [ID:nL3N0RF0VY] The October fall followed a decline of 950.4 billion yuan in the July-September, the first quarterly fall since the data was first published in 2000.

Data shows the PBOC's foreign-exchange assets increased by 776.8 billion yuan in the first 10 months of this year, well below the 2.14 trillion yuan increase in the same period a year earlier, as the central bank had less need to intervene.

"We are almost certain that an RRR cut is coming soon, although it is difficult to gauge the exact time," said Zhou Hao, an economist at ANZ. "This is mainly because the government appears still hoping China could hit its 7.5 percent growth target for this year." Figures on inflation, imports and fiscal spending in November have already undershot expectations since the PBOC's Nov. 21 rate cut, bolstering the case of more monetary easing.
