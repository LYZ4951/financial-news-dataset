June 8 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> is mulling a plan to spin off part of its fixed income business in the United States in order to help trim costs, according to a report in the Financial Times.

The Swiss bank is considering selling a stake in its subsidiary Wake USA - an electronic market for U.S. government bonds that it started with a high-speed trading group Tower Research - the FT said, citing unnamed sources familiar with the bank's thinking. A Credit Suisse spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
