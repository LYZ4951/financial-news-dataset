Sept 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday renewed a pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a "considerable time" and repeated concerns over slack in the labor market, standing firm against calls to overhaul its policy statement.

Many economists and traders had expected the central bank to alter the rate guidance it has provided since March, given generally improving data on the economy's performance.   STORY: [ID:nW1N0Q400M]  TEXT: [ID:nFOMHKEA1C]   KEY POINTS: *The Fed repeated its assurance that rates would stay ultra-low for a "considerable time" after a bond-buying stimulus program wraps up. In a statement after a two-day meeting, it announced a further $10 billion reduction in its monthly purchases, leaving the program on course to be shuttered next month. *The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee also repeated its assessment that a "significant" amount of slack remains in the U.S. labor market, a further sign it is no rush to raise benchmark borrowing costs. *Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser dissented on Wednesday. *The Fed suggested a faster pace of rate hikes than envisioned in the last projections in June. For the end of next year, the median of the projections was 1.375 percent, compared to 1.125 percent in June, while the end-2016 projection moved up to 2.875 percent from 2.50 percent. For 2017, the median stood at 3.75 percent.  COMMENTS: WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES IN NEW YORK:  "From what I'm seeing, there are no major changes, and the market should be reasonably satisfied with that. At this point, assets have been positioned for rates going up at some point in the future, so it shouldn't have much impact. Everyone has been waiting on this. Now we can get back to business.  "The 'considerable time' phrasing was key, and while Plosser had objected to that wording before, now Fisher has as well. That's interesting. But other than that, no changes. I don't think Yellen wants to become more hawkish given that we've seen some softening in the labor market."   MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes slipped modestly  BONDS:  U.S. bond prices pulled back from earlier gains and yields rose FOREX:  The dollar rose against the euro  (Americas Economics and Markets Desk; +1-646 223-6300)  Keywords: USA ECONOMY/INSTANT
