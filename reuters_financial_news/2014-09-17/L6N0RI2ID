PARIS, Sept 17 (Reuters) - France's government has contacted banks about the possibility of privatising or selling a stake in state-controlled lottery and betting monopoly Francaise des Jeux (FDJ), Le Monde newspaper reported.

The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a query from Reuters on the report, which said a unit of the ministry in charge of overseeing state shareholdings had contacted banks this summer to explore options, the newspaper said. While privatisation in the sense of a majority stake sale could be sensitive, a minority stake sale could be an option for a cash-strapped government, the newspaper said.
