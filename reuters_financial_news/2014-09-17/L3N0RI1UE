SEOUL, Sept 17 (Reuters) - South Korean shares closed at their highest in two weeks on Wednesday, following overnight gains on Wall Street based on speculation that the U.S Federal Reserve would stick to a pledge of easy money for a "considerable time" when its two-day meeting ends later in the day.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.96 percent at 2,062.62 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> was firmer, as the dollar weakened slightly on international exchanges with market players seeing less chance of an early rate hike by the Fed.
