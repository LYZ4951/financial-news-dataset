WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A U.S. regulatory council tasked with ferreting out emerging threats to the financial markets lacks the adequate tools to do its job and needs to improve the transparency of its operations, a government watchdog said on Wednesday.

In a new report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) faulted the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for failing to enact certain reforms that were recommended in a similar oversight report issued two years ago. "FSOC still lacks a comprehensive, systematic approach to identify emerging threats to financial stability," wrote GAO staffer A. Nicole Clowers, who will present her findings in testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives panel later on Wednesday.
