DUBAI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Dubai lender Mashreq <MASB.DU> has no interest in purchasing assets of Standard Chartered <STAN.L> in the United Arab Emirates, but is open to acquisitions in Egypt and Turkey, its chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday.

The British bank is aiming to sell part of its business in the UAE after it agreed to close some accounts there in an anti-money laundering settlement with authorities in the United States, sources told Reuters last month. [ID:nL5N0QW1N7]
