LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - IG Group <IGG.L>, a provider of online trading in shares, foreign exchange and contracts for difference, said on Wednesday that first-quarter revenue fell 9 percent as quiet financial markets dampened client trading activity.

Revenue in the three months to Aug. 31 was 85.6 million pounds ($139.3 million), down from 93.6 million pounds a year earlier, the company said.
