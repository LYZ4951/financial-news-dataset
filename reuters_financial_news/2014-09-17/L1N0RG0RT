WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on Wednesday ordered a week-long break in Detroit's bankruptcy trial, giving the last major objector to the city's  restructuring plan time to rework its case.

The hearing will be adjourned from Friday and reconvene Monday, Sept. 29. It also was put on hiatus last week for three days while the city put the finishing touches on a settlement with another hold out creditor Syncora Guarantee Inc.
