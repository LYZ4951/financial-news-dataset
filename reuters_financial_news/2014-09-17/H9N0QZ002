HONG KONG, Sept 17 (Reuters) - China shares ended higher on Wednesday, reversing earlier losses, supported by machinery firms and property developers that were buoyed by Premier Li Keqiang's plans on urbanisation.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> climbed 0.5 percent to 2,308.43 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also finished 0.5 percent higher. Construction equipment makers outperformed following Li's comments on Tuesday that China would accelerate the building of public infrastructure and allow local governments to sell equity in public works. XCMG Construction Machinery <000425.SZ> jumped 5.2 percent, Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology <000157.SZ> rose 2.9 percent, and Sany Heavy Industry <600031.SS> added 2.8 percent.
