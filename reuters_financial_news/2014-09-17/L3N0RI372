SINGAPORE, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) <SGXL.SI> plans to introduce a minimum trading price requirement as part of changes aimed at curbing excessive speculation on penny stocks listed on the bourse.

SGX in a statement on Wednesday set a minimum trading price of 20 Singapore cents for stocks on the main board, effective from March 2016. [ID:nSNZ363tcs] Companies whose share prices trade below 20 Singapore cents  will be given 12 months to reach the threshold. Failure to do so would see the stock put on a watch-list for up to 36 months before being delisted.
