MUMBAI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Indian online classifieds portal Quikr has secured $60 million from backers led by U.S. investor Tiger Global Management LLC to boost product development and expand its mobile business, the company said on Wednesday.

Indian online businesses, especially e-retailers, have been a favourite for global investors who are betting on the segment's growth in a country which already has the world's third-largest population of Internet users, even though less than a fifth of its 1.3 billion people have access to the web. Tiger Global - part hedge fund, part private equity - is one of a growing number of Wall Street financiers eyeing technology start-ups who have yet to list on the market. It is a new investor in India's Quikr, which said current investors had also participated in the latest fundraising. These include Warburg Pincus, Omidyar Network, eBay Inc <EBAY.O>, Kinnevik, Matrix Partners India, Nokia Growth Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. India's Internet use is growing fast, particularly as cheaper smartphones boom. Rising income levels and a young population have also fuelled a surge in the e-commerce sector. Nomura analysts estimated in a note in July that the Indian e-commerce industry could quadruple from $10 billion in 2013 to $43 billion over the next five years, driven by online retail. Flipkart, India's largest online retailer, raised $1 billion in July to scale up and counter increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>. Another online retailer, Snapdeal also raised $100 million this year from five investors, including Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL].
