FRANKFURT Sept 17 (Reuters) - The results of Europe's most comprehensive ever review of its banks' health will be announced on Sunday October 26, sources told Reuters.

The sources all spoke on the condition of annonymity as the date has not yet been publicly disclosed. An announcement is expected soon.  The tests will reveal whether about 130 of Europe's largest banks need to raise more capital for losses they have already incurred and future crises.
