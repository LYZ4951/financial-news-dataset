HONG KONG, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index closed higher for the first time in nine sessions on Wednesday, tracking gains in U.S. markets on speculation the Federal Reserve would maintain a pledge on low rates when a two-day policy meeting ends later in the day.

Strength in China's top five banks also lent support to index gains, after media reports said the country's central bank is injecting a combined 500 billion yuan ($81.42 billion) of liquidity into these major lenders.
