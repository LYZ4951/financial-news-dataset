HONG KONG, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong gained sharply on Wednesday helped by strength in Chinese banks after a media report said the central bank injected liquidity into the country's top lenders.

The index <.HSCE> of major China companies climbed more than 2 percent on the report saying a combined 500 billion yuan ($81.4 billion) of liquidity had been injected. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <1398.HK>, Bank of China <3988.HK> and China Construction Bank <0939.HK> were among major contributors to index gains, rising about 2 percent each. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is pumping in 100 billion yuan each into China's top five banks via a standard lending facility, the Wall Street Journal reported citing an unnamed Chinese bank executive.
