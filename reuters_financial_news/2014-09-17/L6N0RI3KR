LONDON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Pimco's London-based emerging market equities head Masha Gordon has left the giant U.S. asset management firm "to pursue other interests", the company confirmed on Wednesday.

In a statement, Pimco said Virginie Maisonneuve, who is the company's Deputy Chief Investment Officer and Global Head of Equities, is running the emerging markets equity strategy following Gordon's departure. A source at the company said Gordon had left two weeks ago. Maisonneuve joined the firm last year from British fund manager Schroders <SDR.L>, succeeding Neel Kashkari as head of the firm's equities business who left to pursue a career in politics.

Pimco, which oversees $1.97 trillion in assets as of June 30, has hired senior talent across its broad investment platform throughout this year.
