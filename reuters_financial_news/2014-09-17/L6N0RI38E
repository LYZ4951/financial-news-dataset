FRANKFURT, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> stopped advertising German listings to Chinese companies who seek to go public already one year ago, the German stock exchange operator said on Wednesday, one day after a German-listed Chinese shoemaker said top managers and cash had vanished.

"We stopped actively promoting German listings in China in the summer of 2013 for commercial reasons," a spokesman told Reuters. Deutsche Boerse started promoting its trading platform in China in 2006 and opened a representative office in Beijing in 2008.  A Chinese footwear maker listed in Germany, Ultrasonic AG <US5.DE>, said late on Tuesday most of its cash in China had disappeared and that it had lost track of top executives, the latest in a string of similar incidents that shattered investor confidence at foreign-listed Chinese groups.
