WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The following are highlights of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's remarks at a press conference on Wednesday following the conclusion of the U.S. central bank's two-day policy meeting.

ON PART-TIME WORKERS "There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot find them. Too many who are working part time but would prefer full time work. And too many who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market was stronger. As noted in the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) statement, a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. The committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market. Indicators of spending and production for the third quarter suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace, and the committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward."   ON FED FUNDS RATE RANGE "The FOMC now anticipates that it will continue to establish a target range, rather than a single point, for the federal funds rate when normalization begins. The dots ... now show for each participant the midpoint for this target range."   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Full text of Fed statement:   [ID:nFOMHKEA1C]  FOMC statement on exit policy:[ID:nL1N0RI172]  Story on Fed policy meeting:  [ID:nW1N0Q400M]  Take a look on Fed policy outlook:[ID:nL2N0QS10J]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
