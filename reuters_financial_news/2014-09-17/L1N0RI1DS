WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday it will send more than $1.79 million in refunds to consumers allegedly defrauded in a credit counseling/debt management scam.

The defendant, Andris Pukke, and his companies, AmeriDebt and DebtWorks, allegedly deceived consumers about their fees, misrepresented that AmeriDebt was a non-profit organization, and falsely promised to teach consumers how to handle their credit and finances, the FTC said.
