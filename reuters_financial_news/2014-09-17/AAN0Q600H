BANGKOK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Thailand's Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK> has lowered its 2014 loan growth target to 2 percent to reflect a slower GDP growth estimate of 1.5-2.0 percent, the bank's chairman said on Wednesday.

The bank has previously set a loan growth target of 4-5 percent, Chairman Kosit Panpiemras told reporters.
