Sept 17 (Reuters) - The high frequency trading firm Latour Trading LLC agreed to pay a record $16 million penalty to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case accusing it of violating a rule that requires broker-dealers to maintain minimum levels of net liquid assets or net capital.

The SEC on Wednesday said the penalty against New York-based Latour is 40 times larger than the previous high of $400,000, imposed in a separate case a decade ago, for violations of the net capital rule. Nicolas Niquet, Latour's chief operating officer when the violations began, agreed to pay a $150,000 penalty to settle related SEC charges, the regulator said.
