DUBAI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The Islamic Development Bank [ISDBA.UL] is aiming to price a U.S. dollar-denominated sukuk of benchmark size and five years duration on Thursday, after releasing initial price guidance for the issue, a document from lead managers said on Wednesday.

The Jeddah-based institution is targeting pricing in the area of 15 basis points over midswaps, the document said. Benchmark size is traditionally understood to mean upwards of $500 million. The IDB was due to wrap up a series of investor meetings on Wednesday after announcing last week it had chosen banks to arrange roadshows ahead of a potential deal. [ID:nL5N0R9180]
