DUBAI, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Kuwait Food Co (Americana) <FOOD.KW> asked for its shares to be suspended on the Kuwaiti bourse on Wednesday after receiving a letter from its main shareholder stating it was looking into options for its portfolio, including its stake in the firm.

Americana said Al Khair National for Stocks and Real Estate Co was working with advisers to look at different strategic options, which included action related to its holding in one of the Gulf's largest food firms. Al Khair National for Stocks and Real Estate Co is owned by the al-Kharafi family, the majority shareholder in Americana. The food maker has been in focus since Reuters reported in April that the Kharafi family, the billionaire majority shareholder with 66.8 percent of the firm, had hired investment bank Rothschild to explore a possible sale.
