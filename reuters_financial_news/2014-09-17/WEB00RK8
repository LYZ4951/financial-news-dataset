ZURICH, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Cartier owner Richemont <CFR.VX> said the pace of sales growth slowed to 4 percent in the five months to August on a constant currencies basis compared with 9 percent in the year-ago period, due to weakness in Asia Pacific.

"In the Asia-Pacific region, sales were lower in Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China, offsetting positive developments in other markets," the Geneva-based maker of luxury watches and jewellery said in a statement on Wednesday ahead of its annual general meeting. Sales were up 1 percent at actual exchange rates. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected sales to grow 6 percent on a constant currencies basis and 3.2 percent at actual exchange rates.
