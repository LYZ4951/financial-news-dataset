TOKYO, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The head of Japan's regional banking industry lobby said on Wednesday that he did not see any risks materialising from the current rise in long-term Japanese government bond yields.

Kazuyoshi Terakado, chairman of the Regional Banks Association of Japan, also said at a regular news conference that future policy action should take into account any possible negative impact from a weak yen. He declined to comment on the yen's current level.
