STOCKHOLM, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank needs to be flexible and able to react to the monetary policy actions of other rate setting institutions around the world, Governor Stefan Ingves said in the minutes of the latest meeting, published on Wednesday.

"The Riksbank's monetary policy should therefore be flexible in the sense that it takes account of changes in other countries' monetary policies when more is known about what measures will actually be adopted," Ingves said according to the minutes.  Earlier this month, the Riksbank held its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25 per cent and said it would start to tighten policy towards the end of 2015 - as it had previously forecast - when inflation should have picked up from current very depressed levels.
