HONG KONG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Trading in shares of Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd <1619.HK> was suspended in Hong Kong on Tuesday following a 5 percent fall in the stock after research firm Anonymous Analytics released a report on Monday alleging fraud at the company.

The report alleges that Tianhe, which listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in June for $654 million, generates a fraction of the revenue that it claims. A Tianhe investor relations spokesman said "we are reviewing this now and will make an announcement shortly, but have no comment at this time," when contacted by Reuters. Tianhe Chemicals researches, develops, manufactures, processes and sells lubricating oil additives and special fluorides both domestically and abroad.
