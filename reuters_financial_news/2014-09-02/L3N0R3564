Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's landmark review of euro-zone banks will have to produce a capital demand of 51 billion euros ($66.98 billion) to be credible, a Goldman Sachs survey of large institutional investors has found.

The survey of 125 institutional investors from across the globe also found that nine banks were expected to fail the review, with capital shortfalls most likely at Italian, German and Austrian banks.  Investors' average expected capital demand is 23 billion euros higher than a previous Goldman survey in October 2013. The exercise's credibility amongst investors has improved since then, the survey found.
