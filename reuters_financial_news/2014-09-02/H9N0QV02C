HONG KONG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished flat for a third session on Tuesday, but recovered from session lows after major indexes in China's market reached fresh highs this year.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended barely changed at 24,749.02 points, after slipping to a three-week low in the morning.  The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was up 0.1 percent, recovering from earlier losses of 1.4 percent. HSBC Holdings PLC <0005.HK> fell 0.5 percent. Star British fund manager Neil Woodford sold his fund's stake in the bank last month, citing concerns about the impact of potential fines from several industry-wide investigations on the group.
