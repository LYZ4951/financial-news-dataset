NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were poised for a flat open on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 closed out its best month since February, ahead of reports on the manufacturing sector.

* Investors will eye the final August reading on the manufacturing sector from financial data firm Markit at 9:45 a.m. (1345 GMT).  * At 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), the Institute for Supply Management's August reading on manufacturing will be released. Expectations call for manufacturing to dip slightly to 56.8 from 57.1 in July. Also due at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) is construction spending data for July.  * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> were up 1.5 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a flat open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <1YMc1> rose 12 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> added 7.5 points. * The benchmark S&P index gained 3.8 percent in August, its best month since a 4.3 percent climb in February. However, the monthly average volume of 5.24 billion was the lowest of the year, according to data from BATS Global Markets.   * Exelixis <EXEL.O> shares plunged 52.7 percent to $1.96 before the opening bell. The company said on Monday it would cut about 70 percent of its workforce after its experimental prostate cancer drug cabozantinib failed a late-stage study. [ID:nL3N0R24HK] * Dollar General Corp <DG.N> raised its bid for Family Dollar Stores Inc <FDO.N> by 2 percent to $80 per share, or $9.1 billion, and warned it may turn hostile and appeal directly to shareholders if the new offer is rejected. Family Dollar shares gained 0.7 percent to $80.37 in premarket.
