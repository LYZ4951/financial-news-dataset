MANILA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Philippines' Century Properties Group Inc <CPG.PS> said it is open to settling a partnership dispute with Universal Entertainment Corp <6425.T> over a $2 billion casino-resort project, and possibly resume talks on the joint venture.

Universal Entertainment was among a group of companies controlled by billionaire Kazuo Okada that terminated in March an agreement that allowed Century to build luxury residential and retail projects in the 44-hectare (0.17 square mile) project. That prompted Century to seek court intervention. In July, the real estate firm secured a court order preventing the Okada group from terminating the partnership deal.

Century is looking to resume negotiations with the Okada group this year, adding that the company was amenable to a partnership based on previously signed terms. The Okada group holds one of four licenses to operate a casino complex in Entertainment City, the Philippines' answer to gaming hubs in Singapore, Las Vegas and Macau. The casino-resort would be the biggest in the Entertainment City leisure complex on Manila Bay.  Other license holders are local firm Belle Corp <BEL.PS>, which partnered with Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd <6883.HK>, and Alliance Global Group Inc <AGI.PS>, which paired with Genting Hong Kong Ltd <0678.HK>. Bloomberry Resorts Corp <BLOOM.PS> is the first to operate a casino-resort in Entertainment City. Shares of Century Properties were flat at midday on Tuesday, while the broader benchmark index <.PSI> was up 0.4 percent.
