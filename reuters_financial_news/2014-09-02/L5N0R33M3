JOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The South African Reserve Bank has launched an investigation into failed lender African Bank Investments <ABLJ.J> to determine if it engaged in reckless conduct or questionable management practices, the central bank said on Tuesday.

African Bank Investments, known as Abil, was rescued in a $1.6 billion bailout led by the central bank last month after the unsecured lender was hit by waves of bad debt.
