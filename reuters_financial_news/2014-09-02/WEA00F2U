FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Sept 2 (Reuters) - German financial watchdog Bafin on Tuesday said it is checking the circumstances behind Tipp24 <TIMGn.DE> regulatory disclosures for possible violation of market rules.

The Internet lottery company issued a profit warning based on a reported jackpot on Sunday only to withdraw the warning on Monday, saying the reported jackpot win had been mistaken. [ID:nL5N0R24PS] "We are taking a look to see if market manipulation may have been involved," a Bafin spokeswoman said.
