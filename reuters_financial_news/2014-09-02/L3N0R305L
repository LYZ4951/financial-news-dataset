HONG KONG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP <KKR.N> has sold its remaining stake in China Modern Dairy Holdings <1117.HK>, raising around $80 million, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

KKR sold the stake at HK$3.70 per share versus Monday's closing price of HK$3.85, said the source.  KKR confirmed the sale.  KKR bought its stake in Modern Dairy after the country's milk industry was battered by a 2008 scandal involving chemical-laced products. KKR paid $150 million in cash for a 34.5 percent stake. Citigroup <C.N> was the sole bookrunner on the transaction.
