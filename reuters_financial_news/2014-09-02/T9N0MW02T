TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a seven-month peak against the yen on Tuesday, helped by expectations for further gains for the currency on diverging monetary policy paths.

The dollar rose to as high as 104.64 <JPY=>, highest since late-January, with gains by Tokyo shares denting the safe-haven appeal of the yen. The greenback has recently appreciated against its peers such as the euro, which has hit one-year lows versus its U.S. counterpart on expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank.
