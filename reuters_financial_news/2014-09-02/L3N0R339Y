BANGKOK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday amid inflows into selected large caps, with the Philippine index extending its gains for a second day, the Indonesian benchmark climbing to a near two-week high and the Thai key index hitting a 15-month high.

Foreign investors were net buyers of large cap stocks such as Philippines-listed SM Investments Corp <SM.PS>, Philippine Long Distance Telephone <TEL.PS> and Indonesia's telecommunications firm XL Axiata <EXCL.JK>, stock exchange data showed. The Philippine main index <.PSI> finished up 0.3 percent, adding to Monday's 0.5 percent gain and further rebounding from a near two-week low hit on Friday. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> rose to 5,201.59, its highest close since Aug. 21. The Thai SET index <.SETI> rose for a third consecutive session, gaining 0.2 percent to 1,568.60, the highest since May 30, 2013. Brokers in Bangkok attributed the rise to hopes of a possible loosening of policy by the European Central Bank later this week, optimism about the new government and some economic policies expected to be announced soon.
