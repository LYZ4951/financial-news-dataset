SEOUL, Sept 2 (Reuters) - South Korean shares slipped to a one-week low on Tuesday, as signs of weak growth in Europe heightened concerns over the trade-reliant nation's export prospects.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.79 percent at 2,051.58 points.  Market reaction was muted after data from the central bank on Monday morning showed South Korea's annual inflation at a five month low, though giving the central bank sufficient room to cut interest rates again to spur economic growth.[ID:nL3N0R21AF]  The South Korean won <KRW=> reversed modest early gains to close lower on Tuesday, as the dollar gained broad momentum against emerging market currencies after hitting a 7-month high versus the yen.
