PARIS, Sept 2 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Tuesday, bouncing within a recent tight range as investors await the European Central Bank's policy decision later this week before chasing stocks higher.

Shares in Luxottica <LUX.MI> bucked the trend as it fell 1.9 percent after the Italian luxury eyewear maker overhauled its top management structure. [ID:nL5N0R23XL]
