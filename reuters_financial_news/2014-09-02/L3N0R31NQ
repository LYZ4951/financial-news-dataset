(http://on.wsj.com/Z5fGpz)  * Apple Inc <AAPL.O> said it is investigating reports that vulnerabilities in its iCloud service were exploited to hack the accounts of celebrities, leading to the publication of nude photos and videos. Initial media reports suggested that the hacks stemmed from individual accounts on iCloud, an online service to store photos, music and other data from Apple devices. (http://on.wsj.com/1pkmBQL)  * European Union antitrust officials have sent a second wave of extremely detailed questions to the competitors and customers of Facebook Inc <FB.O> and messaging service WhatsApp Inc, an unusual move that might call into question the proposed $19 billion acquisition of the latter by the California-based social network. (http://on.wsj.com/Y7lQ8q)  * Eric Cantor plans to join boutique investment bank Moelis & Co <MC.N>, as the recently defeated House majority leader embarks on a new career on Wall Street.
