BLED, Slovenia, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is looking for ways to reduce exposure to bad loans among banks in the Balkans and so free up lending needed for economic growth, its president told Reuters on Tuesday.

Suma Chakrabarti said the EBRD was working with national governments and central banks and the World Bank to find a solution to the problem of non-performing loans, or NPLs. "I am convinced that unless we tackle this issue, credit growth is going to be very slow and economic growth is also going to be slow," he said in an interview on the sidelines of a business forum in Slovenia.  "We need to help by reducing the NPL percentage. We are trying to find innovative solutions, but it's quite difficult. "Can we actually bring in equity funds, hedge funds, people who might take some risks, take some of these non-performing loans and thereby reduce pressure on banks?" Non-performing loans in the region range from 15 percent to almost 30 percent of total lending, way higher than elsewhere in ex-communist or Western Europe, and are likely to rise further as economies remain weak. As of last October, the EBRD held stakes in Balkan banks worth some 4.1 billion euros. "I hope within the next six months we're going to come up with something which we might try in one or two countries first, and if it works, then spread it to other countries," Chakrabarti said. The EBRD's initial focus is on Albania and the countries of  former Yugoslavia, including euro zone member Slovenia, which narrowly avoided needing an international bailout for its mainly state-owned banks last year.  The World Bank approved in May a loan of $100 million for Albania to help improve supervision of local banks and their safety nets and help reduce bad loans totalling almost 25 percent of overall lending. In Serbia, the region's biggest country, they account for 22.4 percent of total loans.  Chakrabarti said the EBRD was ready to finance a chunk of the project but that a definitive solution was not in sight yet. "(Some) financing would go toward recapitalisation, it could help set up the bad bank, we can also work with certain hedge funds, equity funds ... but until we devise a project, which is what I want to do, it is impossible to say which of these instruments we will pursue."  The EBRD may also take stakes in local companies, he said, and is particularly keen to step up its involvement in Slovenia. "We want to re-engage with restructuring in the corporate and banking sector. It could involve privatisation or simple investments."
