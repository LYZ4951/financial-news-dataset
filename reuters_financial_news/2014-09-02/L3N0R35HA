Sept 2 (Reuters) - The United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office plans to make more arrests in its investigation against bribery allegations at jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc <RR.L>, the agency's director David Green said in an interview to Bloomberg.

The investigation concerns "several divisions of Rolls Royce business activity," Green told Bloomberg, adding that "there will be more arrests."
