MUMBAI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index on Tuesday surged past the psychologically key level of 27,000 to a third consecutive record high, as blue-chips such as HDFC Bank gained after recent data raised hopes about the economy.

The 30-share BSE index <.BSESN> rose as much as 0.8 percent to a record high of 27,082.85 before provisionally ending 0.57 percent higher. The milestone comes a day after the broader NSE index <.NSEI> surpassed the 8,000 level for the first time. The NSE index also hit a record high on Tuesday, rising as much as 0.92 percent to 8,101.95. It provisionally ended up 0.69 percent.
