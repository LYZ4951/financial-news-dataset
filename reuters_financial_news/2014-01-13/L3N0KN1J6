BANGKOK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Thai shares recouped earlier losses and rose 1 percent on Monday after a proposal to push back the date of the snap election scheduled for Feb. 2, but trading was subdued amid large-scale anti-government protests in Bangkok.

Thai key SET index <.SETI> rose to 1,268.71, after falling in the morning session to 1,244.14. The rebound came after a report that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has invited leaders of anti-government protesters and political parties to discuss an Election Commission proposal to push back the date of the snap election she called from Feb. 2. [ID:nL3N0KN1O1] "We saw some short covering due to hopes about the delay of the election date which could help to ease the political tensions," said Pichai Lertsupongkij, a senior analyst at broker Thanachart Securities. Trading volumes were half of the full day average over the past 30 sessions as protesters occupied major intersections in the capital to pressure caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to step down. [ID:nL3N0KM0II] Thai stock exchange president Charamporn Jotikasthira told reporters the bourse had tightened measures, insisting there would be no disruptions to the trading system as the protesters plan a rally at the exchange. Indonesian and Philippine stocks rallied after weak U.S. jobs data revived speculation about the monetary stimulus. The Indonesian index <.JKSE> jumped 3.1 percent to 4,384.56, the highest since Nov. 20. Banking stocks <.JKFINA> surged 5 percent on an outlook for better liquidity. Mining stocks <.JKMING> rose 1.3 percent after Indonesia on Sunday banned unprocessed mineral exports. [ID:nL3N0KM0IO] Indonesia will be shut on Tuesday for a public holiday and will reopen on Wednesday. The Philippine main index <.PSI> climbed 1.7 percent, led by large caps such as SM Prime Holdings <SMPH.PS>, while Malaysia <.KLSE> and Vietnam <.VNI> both gained around 0.4 percent, in line with broader Asia <.MIAPJ0000PUS>. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> pared earlier gains, trading 0.3 percent lower, led by shares of global marine and offshore engineering groups Sembcorp Industries Ltd <SCIL.SI> and Sembcorp Marine Ltd <SCMN.SI>.
