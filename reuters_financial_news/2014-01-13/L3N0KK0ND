JAKARTA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Indonesia's Bumi Resources <BUMI.JK>, Asia's top thermal coal exporter, rose as much as 4.1 percent on Monday after shareholders approved a crucial $1.3 billion debt-for-equity swap deal with China's sovereign wealth fund, CIC [CIC.UL].

Bumi shares jumped as much as 327 rupiah, the highest since Dec. 20. The broader Jakarta stock exchange <.JKSE> was up 2 percent. Only one-third of Bumi Resources' shareholders had to approve the deal after the Indonesian company delayed a previous vote from Dec. 20.
