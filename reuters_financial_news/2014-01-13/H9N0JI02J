HONG KONG, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares got off to a sluggish start to the week on Monday, as strength in Chinese PC maker Lenovo offset weakness in local utilities giant Power Assets after it slashed the size of a spin-off listing of its Hong Kong electricity business.

A sluggish mainland market also weighed, as investors took no cheer from the postponement of another five planned initial public offerings after the securities regulator said on Sunday it would step up supervision of new listings.
