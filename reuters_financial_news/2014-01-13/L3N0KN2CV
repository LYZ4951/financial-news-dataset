BANGALORE, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Banks will repay 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in total of the European Central Bank's twin three-year cash loans, more than they will return this week, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

Consensus of 25 euro money market traders showed banks will return 2.0 billion euros of the first round of long-term crisis loans and 1.5 billion euros of the second round.  That would be more than the 2.6 billion euros combined they will return this week. [ID:nZYN2D2Q00] Over the turn of the year, the ECB suspended early cash repayments for two weeks of the more than 1 trillion euros it injected in two operations at the end of 2011 and start of 2012 to avoid a liquidity squeeze. Banks have repaid over a third of those crisis loans in the past year, reducing excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> in the euro zone and pressuring money market rates in the currency bloc.  The regular poll of 25 economists showed the ECB is expected to allot 112 billion euros at its weekly refinancing tender, almost similar to the amount maturing from last week.[ID: nZYN0L2N24] At the one month operation, the ECB will lend 10 billion euros, roughly the same as they borrowed last time.  ---------------------------------------------------------------ALLOTMENT  ONE-WEEK ONE-MONTH---------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN 112.0 10.0 MEAN   111.5  8.4 MODE   115.0 10.0 HIGHEST130.0 15.0 LOWEST  98.0  3.0 COUNT 25   24--------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------   -THREE-YEAR LTRO REPAYMENTS-   FIRST LTRO  SECOND LTRO   ---------------------------------------------------------------   MEDIAN  2.0   1.5MEAN1.9   1.9MODE2.0   1.0HIGHEST 5.0   5.0LOWEST  1.0   0.5COUNT2424   ---------------------------------------------------------------
