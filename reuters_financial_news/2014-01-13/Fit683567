Jan 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed National Bank of Egypt's [NBEGPT.UL] (NBE), its wholly-owned subsidiary, National Bank of Egypt (UK) Ltd's (NBEUK), and Commercial International Bank's <COMI.CA> (CIB) Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'B-' and revised the Outlooks to Stable from Negative.  The Outlook revision on NBE, NBEUK and CIB reflect the rating action taken on  the Arab Republic of Egypt's ratings (see 'Fitch Revises Egypt's Outlook to  Stable; Affirms at 'B-'' dated 3 January 2014 at www.fitchratings.com).  NBE's and CIB's Viability Ratings (VR), which are highly linked to the  sovereign's ratings, have also been affirmed at 'b-' and 'b', respectively. Credit Agricole Egypt's <CIEB.CA> (CAE) Support Rating, which is also linked to the  sovereign's ratings, has been affirmed at '4'.  NBE's, CIB's and CAE's National Ratings have been affirmed as Fitch considers  that their relative creditworthiness remains unchanged. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS  NBE's Long-term and Short-term IDRs are equalised with Egypt's Long-term foreign  currency IDRs, with the Egyptian authorities' strong propensity to support the  bank constrained by the limitations on their ability to do so (as indicated by  Egypt's 'B-' rating).  NBE is wholly owned by the Egyptian state. It is Egypt's largest bank by assets,  with a dominant domestic franchise, especially in customer deposits.  NBEUK's IDRs are in line with its parent's IDRs and, in turn, Egypt's Long-term  foreign currency IDRs. They reflect Fitch's view that there is a limited  probability of support from the Egyptian state via NBE.  CIB's Long-term IDR is driven by its VR but is constrained by Egypt's Country  Ceiling of 'B-'. CIB is the leading private sector bank in Egypt. CAE's Support Rating reflects Fitch's belief that Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> (A/Stable) has  a high propensity to support its Egyptian subsidiary, but that this likelihood  of support is constrained by the Egyptian sovereign ratings. CAE is about 60%  owned by Credit Agricole and is part of Credit Agricole's presence and strategy  in the Middle East and North Africa region.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS  The ratings are sensitive to the Egyptian sovereign ratings, and any changes  would reflect a change in the sovereign ratings. CAE's Support Rating is also sensitive to any change in Credit Agricole's  propensity or ability to provide support.   KEY RATING DRIVERS - NATIONAL RATINGS NBE's, CIB's and CAE's National Ratings reflect their relative ranking in the  market for local currency risk.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - NATIONAL RATINGS The ratings are sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the relative ranking  of the banks, which could arise as a result of their being affected to differing  degrees by developments (positive or negative) in the market. The Outlooks on  the National Ratings are Stable, reflecting Fitch's expectation that the  relative ranking of the three banks will remain stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR  NBE's VR reflects the close ties between its creditworthiness and that of the  Egyptian sovereign, including through substantial holding of government debt.  Given that virtually all of NBE UK's funding and its main business are dependent  on its connection to the Egyptian sovereign, through NBE, and NBEUK's strategy  capitalises on NBE's franchise, Fitch has not assigned a VR to NBEUK. CIB's VR is effectively capped by its high exposure to the domestic economic  environment and significant holdings of Egyptian sovereign debt. However the VR  takes into account the strength of the bank's local franchise and experienced  management, its consistently strong profitability, sound asset quality and  liquidity. The VR remains above its foreign currency IDR as Fitch considers  that, despite the difficult conditions in the domestic market, CIB's intrinsic  creditworthiness remains among the strongest in the sector.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VR The banks' VRs are sensitive to developments in the domestic operating  environment which would impact performance, asset quality, and/or  capitalisation. An improvement in the operating environment could result in  upward pressure on the VRs. In addition, CIB's VR - being the highest among rated banks in Egypt and above  the foreign currency IDR - could be vulnerable to downward pressure if the  bank's exposure to the Egyptian sovereign were to increase significantly.  The rating actions are as follows: NBE Long-term IDR affirmed 'B-'; Outlook revised to Stable  Short-term IDR affirmed at 'B' National Long-term Rating affirmed 'AA-(egy)'; Outlook Stable National Short-term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(egy)' Viability Rating affirmed at 'b-' Support Rating affirmed at '5'  Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'B-'  Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'B-'   NBEUK  Long-term IDR affirmed 'B-'; Outlook revised to Stable  Short-term IDR affirmed at 'B' Support Rating affirmed at '5'   CIB  Long-term IDR affirmed 'B-'; Outlook revised to Stable  Short-term IDR affirmed at 'B' National Long-term Rating affirmed at 'AA(egy)'; Outlook Stable  National Short-term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(egy)' Viability Rating affirmed at 'b' Support Rating affirmed at '5'  Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'B-'   CAE National Long-term Rating affirmed at 'AA+(egy)'; Outlook Stable  National Short-term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(egy)'
