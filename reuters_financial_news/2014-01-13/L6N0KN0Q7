LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - European shares rose early on Monday to trade near a 5-1/2-year high, with financial stocks helping the market after global banking regulators eased a new bank rule on leverage to aid the global economy.

The STOXX Europe 600 banking index <.SX7P> rose 1.1 percent to the top of the sectoral gainers' list after Sunday's decision on the new rules, which are meant to rein in risky balance sheets from 2018. [ID:nL6N0KM0J6] At 0810 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.3 percent at 1,324.67 points after setting a new high since mid-2008 on Friday. Analysts said that investors' focus will shift to company earnings in the near term. A slew of major U.S. companies like JPMorgan <JPM.N>, Citigroup <C.N> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> will  announce results this week. European earnings will gather pace in the last week of the month.
