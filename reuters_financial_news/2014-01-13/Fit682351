Jan 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that current low bond yields are not an immediate threat to the ratings of European insurers. In the UK, France and the Netherlands, insurers' investment guarantees to policyholders are either well matched by backing assets or not particularly onerous. In Germany, although there are significant unmatched guarantees,  insurers typically have sufficient running yield to cover these for more than 10  years, even if bond yields remain low. Moreover, Fitch's base-case expectation  is for a slow and steady rise in yields, which is close to a best-case scenario  for many insurers. For life insurers, low yields generally make it harder to meet investment  guarantees on existing savings contracts and to offer guarantees that are  attractive to new customers. This puts pressure on earnings and, in serious  cases, may erode capital. Low or falling bond yields can be particularly  detrimental for insurers that write regular-premium contracts with long-term  investment guarantees. This is because they have to invest future premiums and  asset proceeds at lower yields than they expected when they priced the  contracts. Low yields also have an adverse effect on non-life insurers,  particularly those that rely on investment returns to compensate for weak  underwriting results. Many insurers disclose how changes in interest rates would affect their capital  and embedded value. Fitch makes use of the sensitivities provided by insurers to  assess their relative exposure to interest-rate risk. Insurers can alleviate the effects of low bond yields by reducing policyholder  bonuses; improving asset-liability management; re-designing, re-pricing or  withdrawing certain products; and potentially by seeking extra yield from  alternative assets.
