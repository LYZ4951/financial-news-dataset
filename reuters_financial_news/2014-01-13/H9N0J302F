HONG KONG, Jan 13 (Reuters) - China shares underperformed most of Asia on Monday, taking no cheer from the postponement of five new listings, while property developers slid on signs that Beijing is stepping up preparations for a nation-wide expansion of a property tax trial.

Local media reported the land ministry plans to form an inter-ministerial real estate registry, seen as a precursor to any country-wide expansion of property taxes, which have been on trial in Shanghai and Chongqing since 2011. Mainland markets also failed to take any cheer from a postponement of another five planned initial public offerings after the securities regulator said on Sunday it would step up supervision of new listings.
