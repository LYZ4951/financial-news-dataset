PRAGUE, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Germany's Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg <LKBFg.F> (LBBW) has sold its Czech subsdiary to Russian businessman Igor Kim's Expobank, for an undisclosed price, the two banks said on Monday.

The move by Expobank, with total assets of 30 billion roubles ($908 million) as of the end of June 2013, marks another Russian entry into the Czech banking market after Sberbank's <SBER.MM> acquisition of Austrian lender Volksbank's <OTVVp.VI> regional businesses in 2012. "We are interested in the banking market in Europe and the Czech Republic in particular. We plan to focus on providing high quality banking services to wealthy clients in the Czech Republic, as well as for the maintenance and development of foreign trade transactions and business between Russia and the Czech Republic" head of Expobank Kiril Nifontov said in a statement. Both parties agreed not to reveal any details of the transaction, LBBW said in a statement. Czech media reported in September that Erste <ERST.VI> unit Ceska Sporitelna has also bid for the Czech unit of LBBW, offering 47 million euros plus the assumption of 20 million in debt but the Russian bank's bid was 13 million euros higher.
