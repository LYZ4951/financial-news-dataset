MUMBAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose nearly 2 percent to post their biggest daily gains this year on expectations the central bank will keep interest rates on hold and the U.S. Federal Reserve will stick to its ultra-loose monetary policy for longer.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 1.97 percent higher at 21,167.56 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended up 1.85 percent at 6,285.35.
