HANOI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> climbed 0.32 percent by midday on Monday, lifted by gains in energy and securities stocks.

Shares of PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's largest listed firm, edged up 2.16 percent after three gains in a row last week. Petrovietnam Low Pressure Gas Distribution Co <PGD.HM> rose 3.9 percent, while Petrovietnam Drilling and Well Services Co <PVD.HM> advanced 2.33 percent. Investors also bought stocks of some brokerage firms and companies with expected solid corporate earnings in 2013, including steel producer Hoa Phat Group <HPG.HM>, said deputy manager Nguyen Tuan at An Binh Securities.
