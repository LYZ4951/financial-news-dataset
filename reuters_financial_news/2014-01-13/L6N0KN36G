MILAN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Italian small-sized lender Banca Popolare di Spoleto <BPSP.MI>, which has been put under special administration by the Bank of Italy, denied on Monday it had reached a deal to be bought by peer Banco di Desio e della Brianza.

In a statement, Spoleto's special administrators said talks to find a buyer were still under way. Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said over the weekend that a deal with Desio could be announced by the end of January.
