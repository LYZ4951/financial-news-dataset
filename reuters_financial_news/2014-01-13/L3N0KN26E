MUMBAI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose nearly 2 percent to post their biggest daily gains this year on expectations the central bank will hold interest rates at the current levels and the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep its monetary policy loose for longer.

A second consecutive month of output contraction is likely to weigh when the central bank meets for its rate review on Jan. 28. Data later in the day is expected to show consumer prices eased in December, helped by waning food prices, solidifying the case for the Reserve Bank of India to keep interest rates on hold after data on Friday showed industrial output unexpectedly contracted in November.

But the undercurrent remains positive," said Suresh Parmar, head, institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets. "Markets expect RBI may keep rates on hold because of slow growth, which would be another positive in the near term," he said. Foreign investors bought shares worth 681.6 million rupees ($11 million) on Friday, provisional exchange data showed.
