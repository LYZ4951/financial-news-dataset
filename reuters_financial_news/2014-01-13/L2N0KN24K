WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Three former traders at Dutch bank Rabobank <RABO.UL> were criminally charged on Monday with manipulating the Yen Libor benchmark interest rate, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

Two former Japanese Yen derivatives traders and a third trader responsible for setting the bank's Yen Libor rate were accused of submitting fraudulent rates in order to benefit their trading positions, the Justice Department said.
