WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday asked the administration of President Barack Obama to weigh in on whether the trustee seeking money for the victims of convicted Ponzi-schemer Bernard Madoff can recover damages from banks he accused of aiding in the fraud.

The court invited Solicitor General Donald Verrilli to file a brief offering his views on whether a lower-court ruling that prevented trustee Irving Picard from recovering nearly $30 billion from various banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and HSBC Holdings Plc <HSBA.L>, should remain intact. Picard last week announced a $325 million settlement with JPMorgan, meaning the bank will be dropped from the case. That settlement, which must be approved by a judge, was announced just after JPMorgan struck a deal with U.S. prosecutors and bank regulators to pay more than $2 billion to resolve charges that it failed to follow up on suspicious activity by Madoff, who was a client of the bank for more than two decades.  The other banks involved in the case are Italy's UniCredit SpA <CRDI.MI> and Switzerland's UBS AG <UBSN.VX>. There are separate claims against the banks in a class action case that is not related to the issue before the Supreme Court. In June, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Picard lacked standing to pursue a variety of claims on behalf of former Madoff customers. Picard has estimated that Madoff's Ponzi scheme cost investors $17.3 billion of principal. Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 and is serving a 150-year prison sentence. As a result of the latest settlement, Picard has recovered almost $10 billion, according to his statement last week. The Supreme Court will take no action on the pending case until the administration files its brief.
