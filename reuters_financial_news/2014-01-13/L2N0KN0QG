NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures declined on Monday, as investors prepared to assess a quarterly earnings season that will pick up steam this week.

* Earnings are expected from 29 companies in the S&P 500 this week, including banks such as Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, Citigroup Inc <C.N>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>.  * Results are also due from companies including First Horizon National Corp <FHN.N>, M&T Bank Corp <MTB.N>, People's United Financial Inc <PBCT.O> and Charles Schwab Corp <SCHW.N>. * According to Thomson Reuters data, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to grow 7.3 percent over the year-ago period. However, the 9.8 ratio of negative guidance to positive outlooks is currently the largest on record.  * S&P 500 futures <SPc1> fell 6.2 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> lost 27 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> declines 11.25 points. * Equities have started 2014 on a lackluster note, dipping 0.3 percent through the first seven trading sessions as market participants try to gauge the pace of the winding down of market-friendly economic stimulus by the Federal Reserve. * Lululemon Athletica Inc <LULU.O> lost 7.7 percent to $55 before the opening bell after the yogawear retailer cut its forecast for the fourth-quarter due to weak sales in January. [ID:nL3N0KN2LP] * British engineering firm Amec <AMEC.L> said it had provisionally agreed to buy Foster Wheeler <FWLT.O> in a cash and share deal that values the Swiss-based engineer at 1.9 billion pounds ($3.13 billion). [ID:nL6N0KN0LZ] * Beam Inc <BEAM.N> jumped 23.3 percent to $82.56 in light premarket trading after the company agreed to be acquired by Suntory Holdings Limited for $83.50 per share.  * Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc <ICPT.O> tumbled 26.7 percent in premarket trading. The stock jumped over 500 percent last week after its liver disease drug met the main goal in a study.  * European stocks rose in early trade, adding to last week's gains, led by a rally in banking stocks, after regulators agreed to ease the way in which a leverage ratio is compiled to avoid squeezing financing for the global economy.
