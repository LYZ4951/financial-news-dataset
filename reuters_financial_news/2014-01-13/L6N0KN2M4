ISTANBUL, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Turkish stocks rose on Monday as weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data calmed fears that a faster cut in U.S. stimulus would stem cheap capital inflows, but a wide-ranging Turkish graft probe continued to rattle the lira.

U.S. employers hired the fewest number of workers in almost three years in December, non-farm payrolls showed on Friday, surprising markets and helping lift the Turkish lira off Thursday's record lows. [ID:nL2N0KJ291] The main Istanbul index <.XU100> closed up 0.22 percent at 68,294 points, but lagged behind the main emerging market index <.MSCIEF>, which rose 0.84 percent.   Having recovered from last week's record lows, the lira <TRYTOM=D3> slipped to 2.1765 against the dollar by 1546 from 2.1660 late on Friday. The yield on Turkey's 10-year benchmark bond <TR270923TA=IS> rose to 10.04 from Friday's 9.95 percent.
