BUDAPEST, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Hungarian asset prices shrugged off a bomb explosion at a Budapest bank branch on Monday, with dealers looking towards a potential cut in interest rates dismissing the prospect of any escalating violence.

The forint <EURHUF=> eased a shade, Hungarian government bond prices changed little and the Budapest Stock Exchange's main index <.BUX> rose 0.6 percent as attention focused instead on next week's meeting when the central bank is widely expected to cut rates again. Elsewhere in Central Europe, some assets extended the gains posted after Friday's weak U.S. jobs figures signalled the Fed might wind down its monetary stimulus more slowly than expected. The blast went off shortly after 4 a.m. in area of Budapest where there are several bank branches including the branch of Banca Intesa <ISP.MI> unit CIB Bank. No one was injured. [ID:nL6N0KN0VL] "The blast happened early in the morning and apparently they did not want to kill anybody," one dealer said, adding that violence was not expected to escalate. Political tension around Hungary's mostly foreign-owned bank sector has increased in past years because the forint's falls have hiked payments on foreign currency loans.  However, there has been no serious violence, despite Hungarians filing thousands of lawsuits against banks over those loan contracts and holding demonstrations at bank branches. The country's Supreme Court ruled last month that banks were not to blame for borrowers losing out on foreign currency loans. Analysts have said that a Hungarian government plan to aid foreign currency borrowers, possibly at the cost of heavily taxed banks, is a key risk to the forint exchange rate in the months to elections which will be held in April or May.  LEU STEADY But the focus of attention is turning towards next week's meeting of the central bank where it is expected to cut its 3 percent base rate <NBHI> after slashing it from 7 percent in 2012, dealers said. A deputy governor of the bank told Reuters last week that rates may go down to 2.5 percent, the same level as Poland's main rate. Hungarian forward rate agreements, however, have not priced in cuts below about 2.75 percent. <HUFFRA>[ID:nL6N0KI2Y3] Hungary's three-year government bond yield <HU3YT=RR> rose 1 basis point to 3.75 percent, after hitting several record lows last week. The leu <EURRON=> moved sideways after its falls last week  following a Romanian central bank cut in its main interest rate to a record low of 3.75 percent and a surprise move to lower banks' minimum reserve requirements to help economic recovery. Romania's annual inflation slowed to a record low of 1.6 percent in December, slipping towards the bottom of the central bank's 1.5-3.5 percent target range. "The outlook on inflation could potentially deter another monetary policy rate cut in February, but market rates should remain at very low levels as liquidity in the banking system is abundant," said Mihai Patrulescu, senior economist at Unicredit Tiriac.  The main equity index of Poland <.WIG>, the region's most robust economy, rose 1.2 percent, while the zloty <EURPLN=> was flat and Polish government bonds firmed slightly.   The dinar <EURRSD=> weakened slightly against the euro, even though the Serbian central bank, which keeps the currency in closely managed ranges, bought 10 million euros in the market on Friday to support the currency.
