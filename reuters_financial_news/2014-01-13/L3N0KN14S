SEOUL, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Seoul shares rebounded on Monday from a four-month closing low previously after weak U.S. non-farm payrolls provided a lift in risk sentiment by halting the yen's skid, bolstering gains in exporters such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.5 percent at 1,948.92 points, halting a three-session skid. Institutional investors picked up a net 66.5 billion won ($62.7 million) worth of KOSPI shares, posting their first net buying session of the year while foreigners sold a net 95.4 billion won. The two largest components in the KOSPI buttressed the main bourse. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> rose 1.8 percent and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> advanced 3.2 percent.
