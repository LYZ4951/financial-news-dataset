MILAN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Italian airline Alitalia will ask banks to provide it with additional funding, Chief Executive Gabriele Del Torchio said on Monday.

Alitalia will ask the banks for "extra money", Del Torchio told a shareholder meeting. Earlier in January the newspaper Il Messaggero said Alitalia had asked banks to extend an existing loan agreement by 50 million euros, in a sign the troubled Italian airline may again be facing a liquidity crunch.
