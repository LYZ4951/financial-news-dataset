Jan 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Compagnie Lombard, Odier SCA (Lombard Odier SCA) a Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-' with a Stable Outlook and a Viability Rating (VR) of 'aa-'. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed and simultaneously withdrawn Banque Lombard Odier & Cie SA's (Banque Lombard Odier) ratings. Banque Lombard Odier is the legal successor  of Geneva-based former private banking partnership Lombard Odier & Cie. A full  list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The rating actions follow a change in the legal structure of Lombard Odier  effective 1 January 2014 whereby Lombard Odier transformed its unlimited  liability partnership (Lombard Odier & Cie) into a limited liability bank  (societe anonyme; SA, Banque Lombard Odier) and created an unlimited liability  holding company (societe en commandite par actions; SCA, Lombard Odier SCA) as  sole owner of the operating bank. Lombard Odier's current partners will remain the sole shareholders indirectly in  the Swiss bank through the Swiss holding company. Supervisory boards for the  Swiss bank and a monitoring board (organe de controle) for the holding company  with independent members have been established. The Lombard Odier group and Lombard Odier SCA, which consolidates most of  Lombard Odier's non-bank and bank subsidiaries (including Banque Lombard Odier),  will be supervised on a consolidated basis by the Swiss banking regulator,  FINMA, which also separately supervises Banque Lombard Odier.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR AND IDR Lombard Odier SCA's VR and IDR reflect its well-established private banking  franchise, predictable and solid quality profitability, its low risk appetite  and exposure, solid funding and capital position and its impeccable track record  in avoiding operational or credit related losses.  The ratings also take into account the increased regulatory and political  pressure on the Swiss private banking industry in general and the related  potentially sizeable one-off charges. However, Fitch considers the bank's  control framework to be sound, whilst its limited exposure to tax-sensitive  assets reduces potential litigation risks. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Lombard Odier will continue  to generate stable and adequate profitability while avoiding significant  operational or reputational losses.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VIABILITY RATING AND IDRs Lombard Odier SCA's VR and IDRs are sensitive to potentially sizeable litigation  or operational losses given the current general regulatory pressure on Swiss  private banks. The ratings are - in the medium-term - also sensitive to any  inability to compensate revenue pressure on off-shore private banking by  improved earnings from on-shore private banking and its asset management  business.  In the short term, the ratings are also sensitive to an unfavourable resolution  of the ongoing discussions between the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and  various Swiss banks, including Lombard Odier. Fitch understands that in late  December 2013, Lombard Odier decided to participate in the DoJ programme aimed  at regularising any undeclared US private client accounts. Lombard Odier SCA's  ratings are based on Fitch's assumption that any outcome with the DoJ will be of  a manageable size and would be absorbed by Lombard Odier SCA's underlying  profitability. Should the outcome be worse than expected by Fitch, affecting  Lombard Odier's capitalisation, or should the US authorities take more drastic  action against Lombard Odier, this would likely have negative rating  implications. In addition, Lombard Odier SCA's VR and IDRs are sensitive to the build-up of  double leverage in the holding company, leading to structural subordination of  Lombard Odier SCA counterparties compared with counterparties of the operating  entities. The ratings are also sensitive to any decreasing fungibility of  capital, liquidity and earnings between the Lombard Odier entities which is  however not expected by Fitch. Given the already high ratings compared with peers and challenges facing the  sector, ratings upside potential for Lombard Odier SCA is limited.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Lombard Odier SCA's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect  Fitch's view that sovereign support for Lombard Odier, while possible, cannot be  relied upon. Lombard Odier caters for an affluent international client base and  does not have a retail deposit franchise in Switzerland.  In case of need, support from within the Swiss private banking sector and/or the  Swiss banking industry in general might be possible but has not been factored  into Fitch's support-driven ratings. In addition, Lombard Odier SCA might  receive funding and capital support from its partners' private wealth. Again,  this potential support has not been included in the ratings as it would be  difficult to quantify.  RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Given Lombard Odier's business model, any changes to its Support Rating and SRF  are highly unlikely. Lombard Odier SCA, based in Geneva, is the main holding company of Lombard  Odier's partners, consolidating most of the partners' banking assets. Banque  Lombard Odier is Lombard Odier SCA's main bank subsidiary, consolidating the  bulk of Lombard Odier's private banking activities. At end-2012, Lombard Odier  had around CHF165bn client assets under management, making it one of  Switzerland's largest independent private banks.  The rating actions are as follows:   Banque Lombard Odier & Cie SA (legal successor of Lombard Odier & Cie) Long-term IDR affirmed at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; withdrawn Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F1+'; withdrawn Viability Rating affirmed at 'aa-'; withdrawn Support Rating affirmed at '5': withdrawn Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'No Floor': withdrawn  Compagnie Lombard, Odier SCA (Lombard Odier SCA) Long-term IDR assigned at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable Short-term IDR assigned at 'F1+' Viability Rating assigned at 'aa-' Support Rating assigned at '5'
