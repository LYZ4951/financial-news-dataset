WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Monday extended the deadline for municipal advisers to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission until July 1, making a last-minute concession to the securities industry that had complained firms did not have time to digest a definition of advisers spanning 700 pages.

The definition, approved in September, was scheduled to go into full effect on Monday.
