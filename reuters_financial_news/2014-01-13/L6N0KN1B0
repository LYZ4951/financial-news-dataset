ACCRA, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Ecobank is taking seriously a report on its governance by Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission and has made changes to strengthen corporate controls, the pan-African bank said in a statement on Monday.

The bank will convene a meeting of shareholders once it receives in the next few weeks two other reports on governance and any potential lapses in internal control and audit, the statement said.
