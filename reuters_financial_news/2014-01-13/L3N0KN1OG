HANOI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose for a seventh session, closing up 0.42 percent at 521.11 points on Monday, led by gains in the energy sector.

Shares of PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's biggest listed firm, rose 3.6 percent to its record high of 72,000 dong ($3.42) each, according to Reuters data. Other energy firms also advanced, including Petrovietnam Drilling and Well Services Co <PVD.HM> that increased 3.1 percent and Petrovietnam Low Pressure Gas Distribution Co <PGD.HM> which climbed 2.86 percent. Investors sold several other stocks to take profit, including Vinamilk <VNM.HM> and Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, said analyst Doan Thi Anh Nguyet at Saigon-Hanoi Securities. Vietcombank stocks eased 1.08 percent on Monday. Late last week the Hanoi-based lender said its gross profit in 2013 eased 0.5 percent from the previous year to $272 million.
