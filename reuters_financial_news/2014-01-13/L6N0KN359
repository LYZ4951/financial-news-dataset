MADRID, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Spanish construction firm Sacyr's <SCYR.MC> dispute over work on the expansion of the Panama Canal will not have a significant impact on the company's earnings and is not putting its solvency at risk, its chairman said on Monday.

"This process, although it is economically relevant, will not be decisive for the balance sheet of the company, our solvency will not be put at risk," said Manuel Manrique at a news conference.
