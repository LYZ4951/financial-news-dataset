COLOMBO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks rose for a fifth straight session to a near five-month high on Monday, led by shares of large caps such as Ceylon Tobacco Company Plc <CTC.CM>, as falling interest rates helped retail investor sentiment and foreign investors bought risky assets on a net basis.

The main stock index <.CSE> gained 0.55 percent, or 33.25 points, to end at 6,116.39, its highest close since Aug. 21. It gained 2.88 percent in the last five straight sessions, in an overbought market. "With the interest rates, retail investors are pushed to buy shares. The confidence is building up, but there is a long way to go," said a stockbroker on condition of anonymity. Shares in Ceylon Tobacco Company Plc rose 3.05 percent to 1,226.30 rupees. Analysts said the central bank's interest rate cut on Jan. 2 and the recent fall in T-bill yields had boosted sentiment and helped sustain the gains.

The day's turnover was 1.38 billion rupees ($10.56 million), surpassing last year's daily average of about 828.4 million rupees.
