ZURICH, Jan 13 (Reuters) - UBS <UBSN.VX> is not considering spinning off its investment bank, its chief executive Sergio Ermotti said on Monday, rebuffing speculation last week it may consider such a move to quieten demands for it to put aside more capital.

"We are not considering that option," Ermotti said, according to comments made in an interview with Bloomberg Television that have been confirmed by a spokesman for the bank. "We have very defined assets and capital that we want to put at work in the investment bank, and the business model works. Therefore, there is no necessity for us to make changes," Ermotti said. Mediobanca analysts said on Thursday the Swiss bank may be thinking about spinning off its investment bank - and could even resuscitate its old SG Warburg brand - to fend off demands that it put aside yet more capital to protect private banking clients from its investment activities.

"To imply necessarily that a higher leverage ratio means that the investment bank is the one most affected is too much of a simple conclusion."  UBS has been scrutinized since its 2008 bailout by the Swiss government, and is also under pressure from activist shareholder Knight Vinke to dispose of its investment bank altogether. UBS has always refused to do this on the grounds that it is a key strategy pillar. A spokesman told Reuters on Thursday the bank's strategy included the investment bank. [ID:nL6N0DJ38S]
