BERLIN, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Etihad will not be rushed into making a decision over an investment in struggling Italian airline Alitalia, the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi-based airline said on Monday.

"There are no plans to make any announcement at the end of this month," James Hogan told journalists at an event in Berlin. Alitalia is in talks with Etihad, which sources close to the matter have told Reuters is willing to take a large stake. An Italian newspaper reported last week that Etihad could present an offer as early as this week.

We will not be rushed into making a decision," Hogan said.
