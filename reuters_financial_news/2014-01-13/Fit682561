Jan 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Indian Railway Finance Corporation's [INRYF.UL] (IRFC) proposed US dollar notes an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)'. The rating is aligned with IRFC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-', which has a Stable Outlook.  The final rating on the notes issue is contingent upon the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already received.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  IRFC's ratings reflect the entity's public sector status, government ownership  and strong operational and strategic ties with the government of India,  resulting in a strong likelihood of extraordinary government support if needed.  As such, IRFC has been classified as a dependent public sector entity under  Fitch's criteria and the ratings are credit linked to that of the sovereign.  The ratings derive strength from the Ministry of Railways' ongoing support as  evidenced by regular equity injections into IRFC since its formation. IRFC's  debt/equity ratio has been close to the regulatory 10x limit in the past three  years. Fitch expects further capital injections from the Ministry of Railways if  this ratio were to exceed the limit. The ministry injected INR7.5bn and INR6bn  in FY12 and FY13, respectively.  IRFC is the sole financing arm of the Ministry of Railways and is mainly  involved in providing finance leases to rolling stocks including locomotives,  passenger coaches, and freight wagons among others. Fitch expects IRFC's  collaboration with the government to persist.  IRFC is wholly owned by the government and the board of directors is appointed  by the government. The Ministry of Railways signs a memorandum of understanding  with IRFC every year to set its operational and financial performance targets,  which it reviews on a quarterly basis. The Comptroller and Auditor General of  India appoint IRFC's auditors on an annual basis, enhancing government control.  It has been agreed with IRFC that the Ministry of Railways will cover any  shortfall, by making advance payments of lease rentals, if IRFC does not have  sufficient resources to redeem maturing bonds and/or repay loans. Fitch expects  future standard lease agreements to continue to contain a similar assurance and  the ministry to provide funding to prevent liquidity mismatches that may lead to  an IRFC default.  IRFC's profitability is resilient and highly visible because its interest income  is charged on a cost mark-up basis and the capital investment pipeline of the  Indian railway sector is strong. Its assets and liabilities are closely matched.  With a sound reputation in capital market, Fitch expects IRFC to be able to  easily access domestic capital markets and banks for low-cost long-term funding.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  A positive rating action would stem from a similar change in the ratings of the  Indian sovereign in conjunction with continued strong support from the  government.  Significant changes to its strategic importance and financing arm status to the  Ministry of Railways or a dilution in the government's shareholding to less than  51% could result in the entity no longer being classified as a dependent public  sector entity and therefore no longer being credit- linked to the sovereign  rating.
