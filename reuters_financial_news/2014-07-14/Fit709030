July 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Canadian home prices remain overvalued  relative to historical macroeconomic fundamental drivers, Fitch Ratings says.   Despite government efforts to moderate growth, home prices rose 7.1% in May (on  a year-over-year basis) according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.  In  addition, both property sales and building permits for residential construction  have picked up in recent months.  Home prices also continue to be supported by  historically low interest rates and a lack of supply in the major metropolitan  areas; these factors have propped up affordability and drive demand. According  to Fitch's sustainable home price model, which measures home prices relative to  long-term fundamentals, Canadian home prices remain approximately 20% overvalued  in real terms. We believe high household debt relative to disposable income has made the market  more susceptible to market stresses like unemployment or interest rate  increases. The ratio reached a high of 164.1% in third-quarter 2013 before  declining slightly in the following two quarters. Fitch projects unemployment  will likely remain in its current 7% range. But low interest rates are unlikely  to fall further. Rising interest rates could pressure the market more than  others given high borrower leverage and the short-term structure of Canadian  mortgages.
