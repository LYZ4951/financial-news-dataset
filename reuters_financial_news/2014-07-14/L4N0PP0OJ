SINGAPORE, July 14 (Reuters) - Units of Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT) <FRHO.SI>, backed by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, rose 2 percent above their initial public offer price after its issue was over-subscribed nearly 19 times.

Securities of the trust, which includes hotels and other hospitality assets, opened at S$0.90 per unit on Monday versus an IPO price of S$0.88. Over 7 million units changed hands within the first few minutes of trade. Real estate investment trusts and business trusts are the lone bright spots in an otherwise weak IPO market in Singapore, driven by strong demand from retail and institutional investors appetite for dividends.
