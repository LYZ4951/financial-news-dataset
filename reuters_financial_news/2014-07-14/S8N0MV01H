MADRID, July 14 (Reuters) - Spanish wireless networks provider Gowex <GOW.MC>, whose founder and ex-CEO acknowledged last week having misrepresented the financial accounts for at least the last four years, has filed for bankruptcy on Monday, the company's lawyers told Reuters.

Law firm Velez & Urbina said in an email that Gowex had taken this decision because it was in a state of "imminent insolvency" and faced a "financial standstill" after a high number of contracts were ended and new projects were cancelled in the wake of the accounting scandal.
