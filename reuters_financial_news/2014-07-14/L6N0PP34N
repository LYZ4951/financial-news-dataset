KAMPALA, July 14 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> gained ground on Monday as demand for dollars from the corporate sector eased.

At 1051 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,635/2,645, stronger than last Friday's close of 2,655/2,665. "The enormous appetite (for dollars) that we had from corporates last week has more or less petered out," said Ahmed Kalule, trader at Bank of Africa. "So the shilling is benefiting from that but also liquidity is extremely tight... That's lending extra support."  Kalule said the overnight funds rate rose to about 12 percent on Monday from about 8 percent on Thursday.  Last week the central bank soaked up hundreds of billions of shillings of excess liquidity via repurchase agreements (repos) and also sold dollars twice as it tried to ease pressure on the local currency exerted by demand for dollars from telecom firms. The shilling has lost 4.4 percent against the dollar this year. "I still expect the shilling to be vulnerable to a depreciation risk because as long as rates on Ugandan debt remain depressed," said a trader at a leading commercial bank.
