MILAN, July 14 (Reuters) - Generali <GASI.MI> said on Monday it had agreed to sell its Swiss wealth management unit BSI to Brazil's BTG Pactual <BPAC3.SA> for 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($1.69 billion), thus completing its planned disposal of non-insurance assets.

The Italian insurer said the sale of BSI, which it had acquired before the global financial crisis, will generate a net loss of around 100 million euros but should boost by 9 percentage points the group's Solvency I ratio.
