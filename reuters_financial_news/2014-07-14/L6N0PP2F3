LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest payday lender Wonga said former RSA Insurance Group <RSA.L> chief executive Andy Haste had joined as chairman and pledged to push through changes at the company.

Wonga and other short-term loan providers have come under fire in Britain for the high level of interest rates they charge. Wonga's co-founder and chief executive Errol Damelin became chairman in November and he left the board in June.
