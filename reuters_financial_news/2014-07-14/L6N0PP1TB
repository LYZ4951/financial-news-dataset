FARNBOROUGH, England, July 14 (Reuters) - Engine maker GE <GE.N> expects $30 billion of orders for itself and joint venture CFM during the Farnborough Airshow and said it was the right decision that the A330neo plane launched by Airbus will be powered only by engines from rival Rolls-Royce <RR.L>.

Airbus <AIR.PA> opened the airshow on Monday by announcing plans to launch a revamped version of its A330 mid-range plane. [ID:nL6N0PP18G] David Joyce, CEO of GE Aviation, said that GE had plenty of business for the next five to eight years and that supplying engines for the A330neo would not have made sense from a financial viewpoint.
