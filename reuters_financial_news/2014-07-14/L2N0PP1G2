WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Accounting giant Ernst & Young [ERNY.UL] will pay $4 million to settle civil charges that it violated auditor independence rules after one of its units lobbied congressional staffers on behalf of audit clients, U.S. regulators said Monday.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said the firm is settling the case without admitting or denying the charges. SEC rules prohibit auditors from serving as "advocates" for audit clients because doing so may cloud their independence.
