July 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc <C.N> said it agreed to pay $7 billion to settle a U.S. government investigation into mortgage-backed securities the bank sold in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.

Citigroup said on Monday it would pay a total of $4.5 billion in cash and provide $2.5 billion in consumer relief. The bank said it would take a related pre-tax charge of about $3.8 billion in the second quarter. [ID:nBw5KsfFla]
