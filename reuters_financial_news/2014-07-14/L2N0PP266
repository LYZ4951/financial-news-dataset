BRASILIA, July 14 (Reuters) - Shareholders of Grupo Oi SA <OIBR3.SA> are likely to revisit terms of a merger with Portugal Telecom SPGS SA <PTC.LS> if the latter's debt investments with troubled Banco Espírito Santo SA <BES.LS> end up in default, Brazilian Communications Minister Paulo Bernardo said on Monday.

Shareholders of the Brazilian telecommunications company, which include state development bank BNDES, could also seek to revisit the stakes that partners would have in the combined company in the event of a default, Bernardo said.
