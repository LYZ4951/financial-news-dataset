LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Hard currency reserves in many big emerging economies have risen this year, thanks to buoyant investment inflows and central bank efforts to replenish depleted coffers. [nL6N0PM48Y]

Reserves of India and Indonesia, part of a group called "the Fragile Five" last year, have increased by $23 billion and $9 billion respectively. Levels have also risen significantly in Taiwan, Mexico and South Korea which are benefiting from exports to the recovering U.S. economy. Russia, however, has posted a $34 billion drop in reserves since the start of the year as tensions with Ukraine have curtailed foreign investment and forced the central bank to spend dollars in the rouble's defence.
