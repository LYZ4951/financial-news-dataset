LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Swiss private aviation firm VistaJet is in talks with bankers over a potential sale of the business which could fetch up to $900 million, two financial sources said on Monday.

VistaJet, which is known for its distinctive silver aeroplanes and is wholly owned by founder Thomas Flohr, is close to appointing financial advisers and could start a sale process in September, one of the sources said.
