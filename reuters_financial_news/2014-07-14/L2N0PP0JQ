July 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are trading higher on Monday, lifted by merger activity and better-than-expected earnings from Citigroup.

U.S. traded shares of British drugmaker Shire Plc <SHPG.O> are rising 1.6 percent as it said it is ready to agree to AbbVie's <ABBV.N> increased 31 billion pounds ($53 billion) takeover offer, which is motivated partly by a lower tax burden. [ID:nL6N0PP17H] Whiting Petroleum Corp <WLL.N> said on Sunday it would acquire Kodiak Oil & Gas Corp <KOG.N> for $3.8 billion in stock. Shares of Whiting are up 6.1 percent at $83.35 and Kodiak stock is up 5.4 percent at $15. [ID:nL2N0PO0JZ] Citi shares are up 3.6 percent at $48.69 after it reported a stronger-than expected adjusted quarterly profit. Bank of America is up 1.3 percent and the S&P 500 financial sector index <.SPSY> is up 0.9 percent. [ID:nL4N0PP3M8] Index snapshot at 9:41: * S&P 500 <.SPX> is up 9.48 points, 0.48 percent. * Nasdaq Comp <.IXIC> is adding 20.69 points, 0.47 percent. * Dow industrials <.DJI> are up 103.16 points, 0.61 percent. * Russell 2000 <.TOY> is adding 8.03 points, 0.69 percent. * S&P MidCap <.IDX> is up 7.33 points, 0.52 percent. * S&P SmallCap <.SPCY> is up 4.85 points, 0.73 percent.   From earlier in the session: 09:00 - U.S. stock index futures are higher on Monday, boosted by signs of strength in the nascent earnings season, and RBC Capital Markets wrote that the season could be stronger than many are currently anticipating. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are seen rising 6.1 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, an estimate that RBC "understates the likely trend." "Actual results typically beat expectations by 3 percent," wrote Jonathan Golub, RBC's New York-based chief U.S. market strategist. "Importantly, EPS is expected to trend higher in coming quarters, indicating that [second quarter] results are not one-time in nature." Golub added that bank results were likely to be a drag on the market, with S&P earnings growth coming in closer to 11 percent when financials were excluded. However, Citigroup Inc <C.N> is higher in premarket trading on Monday after its results topped forecasts. Futures snapshot at 08:52: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 8 points, 0.41 percent, with 124,670 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 18.5 points, 0.47 percent in volume of 22,082 contracts. * Dow e-minis <1YMc1> are up 76 points, 0.45 percent with 19,259 contracts changing hands.  08:38 - Citigroup shares are attracting a lot of volume in early trading, with the price up more than 3 percent after the bank posted earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. [ID:nL4N0PP3KN] The bank is also agreeing to pay $7 billion to settle a U.S. government investigation into mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. [ID:nL4N0PP37T] The settlement figure is more than twice what many analysts expected earlier this year but less than the $12 billion sought by the government.  More than 1.2 million shares have changed hands already, compared to the 15.3 million traded on average in the past 10 sessions. Futures snapshot at 8:30: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 8 points, 0.41 percent, with 119,218 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 18.5 points, 0.47 percent, in volume of 21,073 contracts. * Dow e-minis <1YMc1> are up 77 points, 0.46 percent, with 18,708 contracts changing hands.  07:50 - Futures are higher in early Monday trading, after the S&P 500 closed Friday with its largest weekly decline since April and as merger and acquisition activity continues to make headlines in the healthcare sector. There are no economic indicators due Monday. <ECONUSTODAY> Citigroup <C.N> is the sole S&P 500 company set to post quarterly earnings. Futures snapshot at 7:49: * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 7.5 points, 0.38 percent, with 102,282 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQc1> are gaining 19.5 points, 0.5 percent, in volume of 18,353 contracts. * Dow e-minis <1YMc1> are up 66 points, 0.39 percent, with 15,881 contracts changing hands.
