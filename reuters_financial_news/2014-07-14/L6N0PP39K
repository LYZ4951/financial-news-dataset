LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Manchester United <MANU.N> have agreed a 10-year, 750 million pounds ($1.3 billion) deal with Adidas AG <ADSGn.DE> for the German sportswear company to supply shirts and kit to the former English soccer champions.

United, who finished seventh in the Premier League last season, had previously enjoyed a long-running supply deal with Nike <NKE.N>, the world's largest sportswear group. Adidas will take over the contract from the 2015/16 season. The deal, announced on Monday, is a record for the Manchester club and will result in United receiving double the average sums paid to European rivals.
