TAIPEI, July 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan financial regulators are planning to allow Chinese tourists to buy yuan financial products when they travel to the island, a newspaper reported on Monday, in the lateest sign of warming ties across the Taiwan Straits.

Mainland tourists will be allowed to trade derivatives, mutual funds and insurance products linked to the Chinese currency, boding well for the Taiwan financial sector's ambitions to compete with that of Hong Kong and Sinagapore, the Commercial Times said, citing unidentified sources.  Officials of Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) could not be reached for comments.
