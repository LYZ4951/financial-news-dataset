July 14 (Reuters) - Swiss lender UBS AG <UBSN.VX> recently hired three executives in New York and London to expand its Global Special Solutions team, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

The team was set up last August to trade corporate and sovereign bonds and loans and credit-default swaps during market events such as corporate mergers, divestitures and management changes, the report said. Nick Gustafson will join UBS's New York office as a senior trader in September from Macquarie Group Ltd <MQG.AX>, according to the report. Gustafson's appointment follows that of Musaab Javed in London last month from investment bank Houlihan Lokey, Bloomberg reported, citing Megan Stinson, a UBS spokeswoman. Zurich-based UBS's London office also added Monica Ugidos from Citigroup Inc <C.N> in May.
