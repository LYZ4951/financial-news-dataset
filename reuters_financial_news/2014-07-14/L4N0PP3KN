July 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc <C.N> reported a 96 percent drop in quarterly  earnings after taking a charge of $3.8 billion related to a $7 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over the sale of shoddy mortgage-based securities.

The settlement figure, announced early on Monday, was more than twice what many analysts expected earlier this year but less than the $12 billion sought by the government in negotiations with the bank. [ID:nL2N0PJ26W] The bank's second-quarter adjusted net income, which excludes the settlement charge and some changes to the value of the bank's debt, was $3.93 billion, or $1.24 per share, compared with $3.89 billion, or $1.25 per share a year earlier.
