LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Israel's debt insurance costs jumped five basis points on Monday to the highest in just over three months as violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip showed no sign of easing.    Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) traded at 87 bps, five bps higher than their Friday close and up 12 bps since the start of July, data provider Markit said.    Rockets were fired at Israel from southern Lebanon on Monday, drawing retaliatory artillery fire from Israeli forces, Lebanese security officials and the Israeli army said. The attacks from Lebanon have coincided with an Israeli offensive on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip which Palestinian officials say has killed at least 160 people.
