DUBAI, July 14 (Reuters) - Kuwait's bourse looks set to continue its rally on Monday, while Saudi Arabia's largest listed company, Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> (SABIC), may come under pressure after quarterly  profits at two of its units missed estimates.

The Kuwaiti index <.KWSE> climbed 1.5 percent to a one-month closing high of 7,179 points on Sunday and trading volume rose  to its highest level since mid-May, a positive technical sign. Since late June the index has tested and confirmed a strong bottom in the 6,900 point area, so technically it would not be surprising if the market in coming weeks tested resistance on its downtrend line from the May 2013 peak, now at about 7,500 points. Market players cite expectations of higher government spending, progress in debt settlement by listed companies and forecasts of strong quarterly earnings as the main drivers of the rally. Kuwait's benchmark is down 5 percent year-to-date. In Saudi Arabia, two subsidiaries of SABIC, one of the world's biggest petrochemical companies, reported weak second-quarter earnings after trading closed on Sunday. Yanbu National Petrochemical Co <2290.SE> (Yansab) made a net profit of 613 million riyals ($164 million), while analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an average net profit for the quarter of 671 million riyals. [ID:nL6N0PO0WG] Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co <2020.SE> (SAFCO) made 639 million riyals ($170 million) in the quarter, against analysts' estimate of 689 million riyals. [ID:nL6N0PO0W0] Analysts surveyed by Reuters expect SABIC's profit to rise 6.3 percent in the second quarter. The stock gained 1.0 percent in the last session after another SABIC subsidiary, Saudi International Petrochemical Co <2310.SE>, said it had made a profit of 245 million riyals in the second quarter, beating analysts' average forecast of 177 million riyals. Elsewhere in the region, Egyptian brokerage Naeem on Sunday raised its target price for Dubai-listed Air Arabia <AIRA.DU> to 1.67 dirhams from 1.21 dirhams with a "buy" recommendation. The stock closed at 1.40 dirhams on Sunday, up 1.4 percent. Another Dubai company, builder Drake and Scull <DSI.DU>, said on Monday its shareholders had approved a plan to issue a 55 million dirham ($15 million) convertible bond to a strategic investor. However, shares in the company already rose last month when Drake and Scull announced the plan. [ID:nL6N0PP0WS]
