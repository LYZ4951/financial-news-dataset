July 13 (Reuters) - About 120 passengers aboard a monorail at Walt Disney World monorail in Florida had to be evacuated on Sunday due to a weather-related power outage, local news reports said.

No one was injured in the incident. Emergency crews evacuated people through roof-top emergency hatches in monorail carriages with passengers walking across the cars while attached to safety lines, TV broadcaster WESH reported.
