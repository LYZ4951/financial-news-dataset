SOFIA, July 14 (Reuters) - Financially-troubled Botev Plovdiv have appointed Velislav Vutsov to replace Luboslav Penev as coach, the Bulgarian club said on Monday.

The club turned to Vutsov after Bulgaria boss Penev left following the decision of the country's central bank to put Botev's main sponsor, Corporate Commercial Bank <6C9.BB>, under special supervision. [ID:nL6N0PI3JD] Vutsov, who turns 47 on Saturday, previously coached Sofia rivals Levski and Slavia and has a reputation for emotional outbursts and strong views.
