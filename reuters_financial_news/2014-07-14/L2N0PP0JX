TORONTO, July 14 (Reuters) - Canadian home prices rose in June but the pace of 12-month home price inflation slowed to its lowest rate in six months, the Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index showed on Monday.

The index, which measures price changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed national home prices were up 0.9 percent last month following a 0.8 percent increase in May.
