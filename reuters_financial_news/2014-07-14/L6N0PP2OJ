DUBAI, July 14 (Reuters) - Qatar Islamic Bank <QISB.QA> (QIB), the Gulf state's largest sharia-compliant lender by assets, posted a 15 percent jump in second-quarter net profit on Monday, according to Reuters calculations, beating analysts' expectations.

The Islamic lender made a net profit of 389.6 million riyals ($107 million) during the three months to June 30, Reuters calculated, compared with 338.9 million riyals in the same period a year ago. Analysts on average forecast a net profit of 348.8 million riyals for the period in a Reuters poll.
