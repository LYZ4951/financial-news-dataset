BANGKOK, July 14 (Reuters) - Thai key index scaled an over 13-month high on Monday as a planned infrastructure development lifted bank and construction related stocks, while Indonesia fell for the second straight session amid uncertainty over election results.

Thailand's public debt management office has set an initial 150 billion baht ($4.67 billion) for infrastructure investments for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, its director general said on Monday. [ID:nL4N0PP2SL] Gains were led by banking stocks such as Krung Thai Bank Pcl <KTB.BK> and Siam Cement <SCC.BK>, which were seen among beneficiaries of the domestic construction boom. The Thai stock market <.SETI> closed up 0.74 percent at 1,529.23, the highest close since June 4, 2013. "The second-half 2014 earnings will recover further, supported by the government infrastructure projects," said broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities. The Bank of Thailand gave a positive tone on the domestic economy on Monday, saying it had no concerns about the stability of the economy and financial markets, including the level of non performing loans (NPLs) in the financial system. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> ended down 0.23 percent, extending Friday's fall. The index hit its highest in more than 13 months on Thursday after a presidential election. Investors had braced for quick-count results for what seemed like a Joko "Jokowi" Widodo win last Thursday but confidence has backtracked following uncertainty over the voting outcome and allegations of vote-tampering.
