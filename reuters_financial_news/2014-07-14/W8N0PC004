WARSAW, July 14 (Reuters) - Poland's economic growth will likely stay above 3 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, but it may slow in the third and fourth quarter, Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Piechocinski said on Monday.

He said the central bank could have taken bolder decisions on interest rates as the economy would need something to speed up growth.
