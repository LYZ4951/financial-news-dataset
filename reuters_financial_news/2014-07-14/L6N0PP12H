LISBON, July 14 (Reuters) - Banco Espirito Santo said on Monday its board put in place new  executives who were originally supposed to take over at the end of July, after the Bank of Portugal accelerated management changes there aiming to distance the bank from the financial woes of the bank's founding family.

Jose Honorio becomes deputy CEO.
