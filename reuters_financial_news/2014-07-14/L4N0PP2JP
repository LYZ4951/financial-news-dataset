MUMBAI, July 14 (Reuters) - Indian shares remained under pressure on Monday, falling for a fifth consecutive session as foreign investors turned sellers, hitting blue-chips such as ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever.

Overseas investors sold shares worth 7.23 billion rupees ($120.6 million) on Friday, after buying $1.6 billion worth of stocks in six straight sessions to Thursday, exchange and regulatory data showed. The selling comes after foreign funds had largely been behind a near 20 percent rally in Indian shares this year. Analysts cited disappointment with the Narendra Modi-led government's maiden budget, which lacked major reforms or enough details about how to meet ambitious fiscal deficit targets. Investors were also cautious ahead of consumer inflation due after the close of markets. Earlier in the day, data showed wholesale inflation easing to a four-month low in June, although the number did not yet capture the full impact of the reduced monsoon rains on summer crop.

There could be some minor corrections, but the undercurrent is still positive," said Deven Choksey, managing director, KR Choksey Securities.
