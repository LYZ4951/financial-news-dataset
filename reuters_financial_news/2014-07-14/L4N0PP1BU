SEOUL, July 14 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> edged higher against the dollar on Monday, snapping a six-day losing streak,  but gains were capped by uncertainty about what Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will say in congressional testimony this week.

The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,018.2 per dollar, up 0.1 percent from Friday's domestic closing level of 1,019.0. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> finished up 0.3 percent at 1,993.88 points.
