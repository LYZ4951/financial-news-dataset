DUBAI, May 22 (Reuters) - Qatar's Ooredoo <ORDS.QA> has signed a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility, the telecommunications operator said in a statement on Thursday.

Ooredoo will use the new facility to repay a $750 million loan due in May 2015, with the rest to be allocated for general business purposes, a filing to Qatar's stock exchange said.
