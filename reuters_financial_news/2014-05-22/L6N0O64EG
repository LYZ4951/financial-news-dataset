COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Reuters) - Danish banks will be able to continue to buy covered bonds on a large scale if the European Union adopts the European Commission's draft for new liquidity requirements for banks from 2015, Denmark's economy minister said on Thursday.

The European Commission on May 9 proposed that Danish mortgage bonds - like government bonds - be classified as highly liquid assets, and may account for up to 70 percent of an individual bank's liquidity requirement.  "We are satisfied with the draft as Danish banks with it can continue their business as usual," Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager told Reuters in an interview.  Danish households would under the commission's proposal thereby continue to obtain mortgage loans in the same way as now, Vestager said. The proposal meets a key demand from Denmark's financial industry and avoids a potentially major disruption for the country's financial sector.

Credit institutions at the end of March held mortgage bonds with a maturity up to five years worth 1,058 billion crowns, nearly a third of Denmark's about 3000-billion covered bond market. In December, the European Banking Authority (EBA) recommended to the commission that all mortgage bonds should be placed in a class beneath government bonds and could cover only up to 40 percent of banks' liquidity buffers, meaning Danish banks would from 2015 buy substantially less covered bonds in order to meet the liquidity requirements. The Danish government opposed the EBA's proposal and successfully lobbied Brussels to modify EBA's recommendation because the original proposal would have disrupted the financial industry.
