HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) - A former Hong Kong-based fund manager at SAC Capital is preparing to launch his own Greater China-focused hedge fund, people with knowledge of the matter said, adding to a list of new start-ups in Asia this year as the industry show signs of recovery.

Ken Xu left Steven A. Cohen's firm, once one of the world's biggest hedge funds, this month after a more than three-year stint, records with Securities and Futures Commission show.  He plans to start a long/short equity hedge fund by the end of 2014 or early next year, the people added. It was not immediately clear how much Xu's fund would invest.
