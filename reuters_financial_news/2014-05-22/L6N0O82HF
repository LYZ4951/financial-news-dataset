CAIRO, May 22 (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank allowed the Egyptian pound to weaken further at a dollar sale on Thursday after it slid to an all-time low in the official market last week, narrowing the gap between official and black-market rates.

Dollar shortages have fuelled a thriving black market in Egypt. Political turmoil following the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak has unnerved foreign investors and tourists, who are usually major sources of foreign currency. The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1226 pounds <CBEO>, weaker than the 7.1150 pounds at its last sale on Wednesday. It had offered $40 million. Forex traders and economists have described the central bank's decision to allow the pound to gradually weaken as a managed depreciation. The central bank has not given an explanation for allowing the currency to weaken in recent weeks. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars <EGP=> are determined by the results of the central bank sales <EGYTV>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. One black market trader put Thursday's rates at 7.50/53 pounds to the dollar, unchanged from Wednesday.  The pound has weakened around 2.3 percent against the dollar this year, according to Capital Economics.
