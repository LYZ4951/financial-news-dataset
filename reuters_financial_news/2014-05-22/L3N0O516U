KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Reuters) - CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL>, Malaysia's second biggest lender, posted a 23 percent year-on-year drop in first-quarter net profit, mainly due to a net gain from the sale of a business unit in the same quarter a year earlier.

Without the net gain, net profit for January-March rose 4.4 percent to 1.07 billion ringgit from 1.02 billion ringgit a year ago, driven by stronger growth in Singapore, regional corporate banking, Malaysian and Singapore consumer banking, according to a press statement on Thursday.  Revenue for the quarter came in at 3.54 billion ringgit, the statement showed.
