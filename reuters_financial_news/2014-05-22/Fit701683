May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Hong Kong-based Nan Fung International Holdings Limited's (Nan Fung; BBB/Stable) proposed US dollar notes an expected rating of 'BBB(EXP)'. The proposed notes will be issued by Nan Fung Treasury Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nan Fung. The notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Nan Fung. The bonds are rated at the same level as Nan Fung's Issuer Default Rating as  they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations  of the company. The final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documents  conforming to information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Established Market Position: Nan Fung has 49 years of experience in developing  residential and commercial properties in Hong Kong. The company has demonstrated  the ability to come through economic cycles, aided by its strong capital  structure that allows operational flexibility in terms of the timing of  investments. Nan Fung's prudence is reflected in its highly liquid financial  profile, low financial leverage and investment property portfolio that has been  funded mainly via internally generated funds. Sufficient Interest Coverage: Nan Fung's stable recurring income streams are  generated from its investments in investment property, financial investments and  hotel operations. Fitch expects these segments to generate HKD1.4bn-1.6bn in  recurring EBITDA per annum over the next three years. The company's recurring  income interest coverage is expected to stay above 2.5x (2.39x at end-March  2013), which still supports its rating level. Smaller Operating Scale: Nan Fung's investment property portfolio is small, in  terms of absolute asset size as well as percentage contribution to income,  compared with its higher-rated property peers. This weakness constrains its  rating. Its property portfolio amounted to 2.5 million square feet in Hong Kong  and 1.3 million square feet in China at 31 March 2013 (2.02 million square feet  in total at 31 March 2012). Ample Liquidity: The company had unpledged cash of HKD9.6bn at end-September  2013, and diversified and sizable liquid financial assets valued at HKD17.7bn at  end-March 2013. This is compared with debts of HKD17.0bn at end-September 2013.  Fitch expects Nan Fung's liquidity will remain robust, after factoring in the  company's development expenditures and capex over the medium term.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - sustained poor execution of Nan Fung's property development projects - significant weakness in both Hong Kong and China property markets leading to  substantial decline in property prices - Nan Fung's recurring EBITDA (investment property, dividend and coupon from its  investment portfolio) to gross interest expense (including capitalised  interests) remaining lower than 2x on a sustained basis (end-March 2013: 2.4x  and end-September 2013: 2.2x).   Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - Nan Fung's investment property division contributing a substantial portion to  the company's assets and EBITDA - Maintaining a strong financial position such that its financial assets  portfolio and cash levels are above total debt
