DUBAI, May 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co <4300.SE> raised $400 million through an Islamic bond, the developer said in a statement on Thursday, with strong demand for the paper helping to reduce the cost at which it borrowed.

The developer attracted a final order book of more than $1 billion for its five year sukuk, it said in a regulatory filing. Final pricing came at a profit rate of 6.5 percent, it added. This was tighter than the 6.75 percent earmarked earlier on Wednesday and well inside the high-6s percent given as initial pricing thoughts on Tuesday.
