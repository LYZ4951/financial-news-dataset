ISTANBUL, May 22 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank cut its one-week repo rate to 9.5 percent in a surprise move on Thursday, citing an improvement in risk premium indicators and lessening uncertainty.

The bank kept its overnight lending rate at 12 percent and its overnight borrowing rate at 8 percent.
