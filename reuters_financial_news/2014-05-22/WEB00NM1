VIENNA, May 22 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> said it may issue more tier one capital before paying back the 750 million euros ($1.02 billion) in private aid it got in 2009 to weather the financial crisis.

RBI said earlier on Thursday it expected to pay back in the next three to four weeks all or most of the 1.75 billion euros it got in state aid at the time, after selling 2.78 billion euros in new shares in January. [ID:nL6N0O811R] "We plan to repay in first place this state-held participation capital, and the privately held participation capital after a possible additional tier one issue," Chief Executive Karl Sevelda told analysts on a conference call. He said the bank had no intention of changing its dividend policy.
