May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings assigns a credit rating of 'BBB' to the EUR500 million aggregate principal amount of guaranteed notes issued by Prologis, L.P. [PLDXXP.UL], the operating partnership of Prologis, Inc. <PLD.N> (NYSE: PLD; collectively including rated subsidiaries Prologis or the company). The 2026 notes have an annual coupon rate of 3% and were priced at 99.138% of the  principal amount to yield 3.087% to maturity or 125 basis points (bps) over the  mid-swap rate. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Prologis, L.P. that are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. The company intends to use the net  proceeds of approximately EUR493.2 million for the redemption of $182 million of  5.625% notes due November 15, 2016. The company will use the remaining net  proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or  repurchase other indebtedness. In the short term, Prologis intends to use the  net proceeds to repay borrowings under its multi-currency senior term loan.  In addition to the 2026 notes, Fitch currently rates Prologis as follows: Prologis, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --$100 million preferred stock 'BB+'.  Prologis, L.P. --IDR 'BBB'; --$2 billion global senior credit facility 'BBB'; --$6.2 billion senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes 'BBB'.  Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership --JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB'; --JPY10 billion senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Prologis, Inc.'s 'BBB' IDR reflects leverage that remains elevated for the  rating though expected to decline principally via improving property  fundamentals. The rating is supported by the stable cash flow from the company's  global industrial real estate portfolio that contributes towards appropriate  fixed-charge coverage, strong asset quality, and excellent access to capital.  Development continues to be a core tenet for the company and Prologis endeavors  to match-fund acquisitions and development expenditures with proceeds from  dispositions and fund contributions, a strategy that can materially impact  corporate liquidity. Contingent liquidity is strong as measured by unencumbered  asset coverage of unsecured debt.  High Leverage for 'BBB'; Expected to Decline Current leverage is high for a 'BBB' rating (8.1x pro rata in the first quarter  of 2014 [1Q'14]), but Fitch's base case forecasts that pro rata leverage will  approach 7x by year-end 2014 and 6.5x by year-end 2015, which would be strong  for the 'BBB' rating. However, the decline in leverage may be choppy  sequentially as the timing of dispositions and fund contributions may not match  that of acquisitions and development starts. Fitch defines leverage as net debt to recurring operating EBITDA on a pro rata  basis given PLD's willingness to buy back and/or recapitalize unconsolidated  assets and its agnostic view towards property management for consolidated and unconsolidated assets. Fitch's  methodology differs from that of PLD's, which also seeks to adjust for the  effects of the development business by either including gains on dispositions  and contributions or adjusting EBITDA to reflect future NOI contributions. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which same store net operating  income (SSNOI) declines by levels experienced in 2009 - 2010, leverage would  exceed 8x, which would be weak for a 'BBB' rating. Improving Operating Fundamentals and Cash Flow Support Fixed Charge Coverage  The vast majority of PLD's earnings are derived from property-level net  operating income (NOI), which is complemented by the company's investment  management income. During 1Q'14, cash SSNOI increased by 4.1%  as compared to  1.6% on average for 2013 and net effective rents on leases signed in the quarter  increased 7.0% from in-place rents, a leading indicator for 2014 SSNOI growth.  Approximately 8.7% of pro rata base rents expire during the remainder of 2014  followed by 18.9% in 2015, and the current strength of the industrial real  estate market allows such expirations to be an opportunity for additional  growth. Fitch expects PLD's SSNOI growth will be 3% in 2014 followed by similar  growth in 2015 based largely on positive net absorption. Operating portfolio  occupancy was 94.5% as of March 31, 2014, slightly down from 95.1% as of Dec.  31, 2013 and consistent with seasonal patterns but up from 93.7% as of March 31,  2013. Pro forma for the issuance of the EUR500 million 3% senior notes due 2026,  redemption of 5.625% notes due 2016, repayment of borrowings under the unsecured  global line of credit and multicurrency unsecured term loan, 1Q'14 pro rata  fixed-charge coverage is appropriate for the 'BBB' rating would have been 2.0x  (2.1x in 1Q'14) compared with 1.8x in 4Q'13 and 1.9x in 3Q'13. Fitch defines pro  rata fixed-charge coverage as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less pro rata  recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments divided by  pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends. Fitch's base case anticipates that coverage will approach 2.5x over the next  12-to-24 months due to expected SSNOI growth, which is strong for the 'BBB'  rating.  Global Platform The company's large platform ($51.1 billion of assets under management at March  31, 2014) limits the effects of any one region's fundamentals to the overall  cash flows. PLD derived 83.0% of its 1Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (58.1% in the Americas, 19.6% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia).  Private Capital Simplification The company has reduced the total number of co-investment vehicles that it  manages via consolidation and the purchase of assets upon closed end fund  expirations. The majority of funds are infinite life, which eliminates take-out  risk at the fund's maturity. In addition, the fund platform provides an  additional layer of fee income and recurring cash distributions to cover PLD's  fixed charges. Recently formed ventures include Prologis China Logistics Venture  2 with HIP China Logistics Investments Limited and Prologis U.S. Logistics  Venture (USLV) with Norges Bank Investment Management.  Strong Asset Quality PLD has a high-quality portfolio as evidenced by a focus on properties with  proximity to ports or intermodal yards, cross-docking capabilities and  structural items such as tall clearance heights. The portfolio has limited  tenant concentration which is a credit strength, with only the top three tenants  comprising more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's top tenants at March  31, 2014 were DHL (2.2% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of ABR), and Kuehne &  Nagel (1.2% of ABR).  Excellent Capital Access The company's access to capital is strong as evidenced by the diversified  capital structure which includes secured and unsecured debt from public and  private sources, as well as preferred stock, common and private equity capital.  Prologis completed a total of $17.5 billion of capital markets activity in 2013  and $1.2 billion of debt financings and refinancings in 1Q'14, including the  issuance of EUR700 million of Eurobonds. Additionally, the company redeemed  $194.2 million of U.S. senior notes and repaid $239.3 million of secured debt.  The company established an ATM program during 2013 through which it may issue up  to $750 million of common stock, though it has yet to utilize this program.  Proactive Liability Management In addition to recent U.S. dollar and Euro denominated bond offerings, tender  offers, and debt repurchases, Prologis upsized its global credit facility in  July 2013 to $2 billion from $1.65 billion and improved all-in pricing to LIBOR  plus 130 bps, a reduction of 40 bps from the prior global credit facility. The  company also recast its Japan revolver in 2013, upsizing this facility to JPY45  billion from JPY36.5 billion.  Risks & Returns of Development Development is a core tenet of PLD's business model, and through multiple  property cycles, Prologis has developed over a thousand properties at  mid-to-high teen percentage margins. Development improves the quality of the  portfolio, creates value via the entitlement, construction and leaseup of new  properties and enables PLD to realize cash gains on the contribution of the  stabilized developments to managed funds. Credit concerns related to development include the effects on corporate  liquidity and inherent cyclicality. As evidenced by the past downturn, when  leasing is insufficient to meet occupancy stabilization levels required for  contribution, partially stabilized developments remain on PLD's balance sheet  and are initially funded with short-term debt at the REIT, thus increasing  leverage and reducing corporate liquidity. Partially mitigating the aforementioned risks is the fact that the total  development pipeline is significantly smaller at approximately $1.9 billion at  March 31, 2014 versus $6 billion (including legacy ProLogis and AMB Property  Corporation) at Dec. 31, 2007. The pipeline's size is large on an absolute basis  but manageable on a relative basis as PLD's share of cost to complete  development represented 2.6% of pro rata gross assets as of March 31, 2014.  However, the pipeline entails moderate lease-up risk as build-to-suit projects  represented approximately 38.9% of development starts for first-quarter 2014. In  addition, in May 2014, the company announced that it will develop three  inventory logistics facilities totaling 3.2 million square feet near Tokyo, all  of which are speculative projects. The pipeline should remain active in the coming years due to industrial real  estate supply-demand dynamics. Demand for industrial REIT space is skewed toward  larger and newer facilities from tenants such as e-commerce companies,  traditional retailers, and third-party logistics providers.   Match-Funded Liquidity Strategy Fitch base case liquidity coverage is strong for the rating at 1.7x for the  period April 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  liquidity sources divided by uses. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash,  availability under revolving credit facilities pro forma for the 2026 notes  offering, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity  uses include pro rata debt maturities after extension options at PLD's option  and projected recurring capital expenditures. Liquidity coverage would be 1.3x when including dispositions and contributions  as liquidity sources and acquisitions and development starts as liquidity uses.  Assuming an 80% refinance rate on upcoming secured debt maturities, liquidity  coverage would be 1.6x. As of March 31, 2014 near-to-medium term debt maturities  are staggered; 4.0% of pro rata debt matures during the remainder of 2014,  followed by 9.9% in 2015. Prologis has strong contingent liquidity as unencumbered assets (1Q'14 estimated  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) cover pro forma  unsecured debt by 2.6x. When applying a stressed 50% haircut to the book value  of land and 25% haircut to construction in progress, pro forma unencumbered  asset coverage improves to a strong 2.8x. However, the company's AFFO payout  ratio was 97.3% in 1Q'14 and 95.4% in 2013, indicating limited liquidity  generated from operating cash flow after dividends.  Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between PLD's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default.  Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that leverage will remain  between 7.0x and 8.0x over the next 12 months, offset by liquidity coverage of  above 1.0x and fixed-charge coverage of around 2.0x over the next 12 months.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining below 6.5x (pro rata  leverage was 8.1x in 1Q'14); --Liquidity coverage including development sustaining above 1.25x (Fitch base  case liquidity coverage is 1.7x, but 1.3x when including dispositions and  contributions as liquidity sources and acquisitions and development starts as  liquidity uses); --Fitch's expectation of pro rata fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.0x  (pro rata coverage was 2.0x in 1Q'14 pro forma).  The following factors may result in negative momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 7.5x; --Liquidity coverage including development sustaining below 1.0x;
