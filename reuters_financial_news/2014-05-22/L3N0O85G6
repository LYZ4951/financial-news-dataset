SYDNEY, May 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen edging higher on Friday, supported by an uptick on Wall Street and a recovery in metals prices after improved manufacturing data from China.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.2 percent, a 19.1-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 1 percent on Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage gain since February 12.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> added 0.1 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended higher for a second straight session on Thursday, led by small-cap stocks, while the Nasdaq climbed on a rally in biotech shares.  * Copper and aluminium rose after two days of losses, on encouraging signals about economic growth in top metals consumer China and in the euro zone. Gold rose on follow-through buying. * Chinese steel and iron ore futures rose, supported by an improved manufacturing activity gauge, but persistent uncertainty over the outlook for demand pulled prices off the day's highs.  * Tugboat workers agreed on Thursday to suspend plans to go on strike at Australia's biggest iron ore port till at least late June, just as miners stepped up efforts to avert action that could halt a quarter of the world's seaborne iron ore supply.

Its official quotation is 1.1 billion shares fully paid, issued at A$1.60 per share.
