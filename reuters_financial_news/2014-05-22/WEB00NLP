VIENNA, May 22 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International has barely been affected by massive capital outflows from Russia amid Moscow's political confrontation with the West, Chief Executive Karl Sevelda told Austrian radio in an interview on Thursday.

"That hardly affects us. We assume that lots of this money is Russian money that has flowed abroad. So far we are observing  none to little of this outflow," he said.
