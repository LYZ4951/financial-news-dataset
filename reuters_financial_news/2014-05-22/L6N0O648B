COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Reuters) - The Danish government is in no hurry to decide about participating in the European Banking Union from January 2015, Minister of Economic Affairs Margrethe Vestager told Reuters.

Vestager said the government would examine the consequences for the Danish economy, especially for the financial sector, before any decision. "It is of no use to hurry," Vestager said. "All aspects and doubts must go through a thorough examination and analysis before we start negotiations with all political parties." Euro nations are expected to form a banking union in January 2015 after the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority in October have presented their results of the capital state of the 130 biggest banks in the Euro Zone. Non-euro countries within the European Union can join the Banking Union on the condition that their banks comply with the strengthen capital requirement.
