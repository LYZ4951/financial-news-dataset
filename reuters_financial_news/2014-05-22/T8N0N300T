TAIPEI, May 22 (Reuters) - British Petroleum <BP.L> and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD.UL] have shown interest in raising money in Taiwan via selling yuan bonds, the over-the-counter Gretai Stock Exchange said on Thursday.

The two European financial institutions expressed their interest during meetings with the head of the exchange in London, the exchange said in a statement. Taiwan has ambitions to promote itself as an offshore yuan center, competing with rival financial centres Hong Kong and London.
