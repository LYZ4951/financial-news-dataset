May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the divergence in rating dynamics between Morocco (BBB-/Stable) and Tunisia (BB-/Negative) since the start of the Arab Spring in early 2011 reflects different developments arising from the political transition in each country and  their impact on economic performance.  In Tunisia, the political transition has proved long and difficult with  recurrent violence and popular protest. Marked political instability (with four  prime ministers in three years) has undermined confidence in the economy and in  Tunisia's ability to reform and finance widening twin deficits.  In contrast, Morocco's transition to a more open political system was smooth. A  new constitution that gave more power to the elected Parliament was adopted in  mid-2011. The elections that followed brought to power a coalition dominated by  the Parti de la Justice et du Developpement. Social and political stability has  allowed the authorities to implement potentially difficult reforms, as  illustrated by the gradual increase in subsidised energy prices. The smoother political transition in Morocco was aided by a tradition of  political pluralism, the permanence of the monarchy (with King Mohammed VI seen  as a reformer and legitimate among the population), and economic and social  reforms started after the accession of the King to the throne in 1999.  Stability in Morocco has supported growing tourist arrivals (which reached 10  million in 2013) and FDI inflows. Non-agricultural GDP has grown steadily above  4%, except in 2013 when it grew by just 3.1% as a consequence of slower growth  in the eurozone. In contrast, Tunisia's GDP contracted by 1.9% in 2011 and  growth has since remained well below the pre-revolution trend. Tourist inflows  (six million in 2013) are well below the 2010 level (seven million) and FDI has  declined. Rising inflation has added to instability.  The combination of accommodative policies, high oil prices and a weak eurozone  has led to a sharp deterioration in budget and current account deficits in both  countries. In Morocco, the deterioration was bigger and sharper but deficits  started to narrow in 2013 (to 5.4% and 7.5% of GDP respectively) as a result of  fiscal reform, the strong performance of new exporting sectors, and lower oil  prices. In Tunisia, given the slower reform process and a more challenging  economic environment, the twin deficits (6.5% and 8.4% respectively in 2013)  will only narrow from 2014.  The two countries have benefited from official grants and loans from bilateral  and multilateral creditors and are supported by IMF programmes. In Morocco, the  Precautionary Liquidity Line (worth USD6.2bn or 6% of GDP) has been a key anchor  for the reform agenda, but the authorities do not intend to draw on it. In  contrast, Tunisia has drawn on its IMF facility (Stand-By-Arrangement worth  USD1.8bn or 4% of GDP). It has also used partial guarantees from Japan and the  US to issue bonds.  Structural indicators in Morocco and Tunisia, including GDP per capita, Ease of  Doing Business, World Bank [IBRD.UL] governance and UN Human Development index, remain in  line with 'BB' medians and markedly weaker than 'BBB' medians. Unemployment is  high, at 15% in Tunisia and 9% in Morocco in 2013, and is a key social issue.  Tunisian banks' asset quality is particularly weak and the sector needs  recapitalisation (an estimated 3% of GDP). In Morocco, domestic banks have  remained fairly sound despite pressures in recent years. Ratings dynamics in Tunisia and Morocco will crucially depend on their ability  to narrow twin deficits, rebuild policy buffers, implement reforms and  accelerate growth. In Morocco, the Stable Outlook anticipates a gradual  narrowing of the twin deficits, supported by continuing reforms. Tunisia's  Negative Outlook reflects ongoing uncertainty over the political transition  despite this year's adoption of a constitution. Tunisia's rating would benefit  from peaceful elections and the formation of a long-lasting government able to  implement reforms.
