HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares closed at their highest level in more than five weeks on Thursday, helped by strong gains in energy companies after China and Russia signed a massive gas deal.

Shares were also buoyed by a preliminary private survey that suggested China's factory sector turned in its best performance in five months in May. The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.5 percent at 22,953.76 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 1.1 percent, both closing at their highest since April 14.  PetroChina <0857.HK> rose 1.8 percent to its highest since November, while its natural gas distribution arm Kunlun Energy <0135.HK> climbed 3.9 percent, the top gainer of the benchmark index. China and Russia signed a $400 billion gas supply deal on Wednesday, securing the world's top energy user a major source of cleaner fuel and opening up a new market for Moscow as it risks losing European customers over the Ukraine crisis.
