May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

European corporate treasurers are increasingly considering repos as a cash management tool whether directly or through pooled vehicles such as money market funds (MMFs), says Fitch Ratings in a new report.  In economic terms, a repo is comparable with a collateralised loan or secured  deposit. One party buys securities from another party, which then agrees to buy  those securities back at a future date. Accordingly, repos provide users with  access to short-term funding in exchange for assets or the ability to place  short-term cash on a secured basis. This acts as a liquidity management tool and  serves an important cash management role. Repos provide a double indemnity against credit risk. If the counterparty  defaults then the other party has recourse to the collateral. Margin is posted  and maintained, mitigating the risk of mark-to-market losses.  Global Master Repurchase Agreements (GMRAs) govern repos. Operational complexity  and the need to implement a GMRA, despite their standardisation, may deter some  users from directly transacting in the repo market. For these users, other  vehicles that do transact in repos, such as MMFs, can provide indirect access. Fitch notes that the European repo market is substantial. The total outstanding  amount of repos in Europe was EUR5.5trn in December 2013 according to ICMA. The  European repo market is overwhelmingly bi-party (transacted between two  parties). This contrasts with the US market, where repos are predominately  tri-party, whereby the securities are held by a custodial bank.
