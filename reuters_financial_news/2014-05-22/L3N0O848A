May 22 (Reuters) - Shares of JD.com <JD.O>, China's second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, rose as much as 17.2 percent in their market debut on Thursday, valuing the company at about $30.43 billion.

JD.com's debut - the biggest listing of a Chinese company on a U.S. exchange - is being closely watched for clues on how Wall Street will greet Alibaba's [IPO-ALIB.N] IPO later this year. Alibaba's IPO is expected to be the biggest by a tech company in history. JD.com's offering of American Depositary Shares raised $1.78 billion after being priced at $19 each, above the expected range of $16 to $18. [ID:nL3N0O750G] The company's shares touched a high of $22.26 after opening at $21.75 on the Nasdaq. JD.com, which has yet to make a profit, is backed by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding Co <4280.SE>.
