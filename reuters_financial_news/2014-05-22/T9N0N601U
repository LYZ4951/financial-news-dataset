May 22 (Reuters) - Property investor Secured Capital Investment Management Co has put an office tower in central Tokyo's Marunouchi district up for sale for more than $1.8 billion, a bet that investors are confident in a continued recovery in Tokyo real estate, according to four people with knowledge of the process.

Secured Capital, part of Asian private equity firm PAG, wants to sell the 32-storey Pacific Century Place Marunouchi near Tokyo railway station, which it bought for about 144 billion yen ($1.42 billion) in 2009, for more than 180 billion yen, the people said. They asked not to be named because the sale preparations remain confidential.
