LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Hungary's banking sector is burdened with an "unbearably high" level of non-performing loans (NPL) and needs consolidation, central bank governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Thursday.

The central bank proposed regulatory action earlier on Thursday to encourage commercial banks to clean bad corporate loans from their books, saying this should improve their ability to lend and reduce risks to their stability. [ID:nL6N0O821V] "There is work to be done in the Hungarian banking system. The NPL portfolios of the Hungarian banking system are unbearably high. The central bank will launch new programmes in the second half of this year in order to help the banking system to (clear) out the high level of NPLs," Matolcsy told a conference in London. "It's a must, we have to do it." He said prior to the banking crisis of 2008, banks in Hungary had enjoyed uniquely high profitability. "We need a new consolidation for the banking system," Matolcsy added.
