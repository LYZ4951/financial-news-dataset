LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Online gambling company bwin.party <BPTY.L> reached an agreement on Thursday with a rebel American investor who had been pushing for extra seats on the board.

Bwin.party said Daniel Silvers would join the board to represent SpringOwl, the investment group which has a 5 percent stake in the company. It also agreed to consider SpringOwl nominee Michael Fertik as a board candidate. SpringOwl has withdrawn the four nominees it had put up for election to the board at the company's annual meeting which is being held on Thursday.
