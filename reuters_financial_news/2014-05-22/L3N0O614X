HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong and China shares rose on Thursday helped by a preliminary private survey that suggested China's factory sector turned in its best performance in five months in May.

China's gas-related stocks were also buoyed by a long-awaited gas deal between China and Russia, expected to help stabilise gas supply and prices on the mainland.  By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was up 0.7 percent at 23,005.27 points, hitting its highest since April 15. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong jumped 1.4 percent.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> gained 0.6 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was up 0.4 percent at 2,033.25 points. Mainland shares bounced back to positive territory after the HSBC/Markit flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) ticked up to a five-month high of 49.7 in May, from April's final reading of 48.1. But it remained under the 50-point level that demarcates expansion from contraction.

"But whether the upward trend can continue depends on whether capital would constantly go to some blue chips."  PetroChina <0857.HK> rose 1.1 percent in Hong Kong to its highest since November, after its parent firm, China National Petroleum Corp, signed a $400 billion gas supply deal with Russia's Gazprom <GAZP.MM> late on Wednesday. [ID:nL3N0O72N0] The whole gas sector was boosted by the news, with Changchun Gas Co Ltd <600333.SS> surging the maximum allowed 10 percent in Shanghai and Shenzhen Gas Corp Ltd <601139.SS> jumping 6.1 percent. Leading the gains in the onshore Chinese markets were also property developers, shrugging off a downgrade by Moody's on Wednesday to negative from stable. [ID:nL3N0O7160] China Fortune Land Co Ltd <600340.SS> rebounded 7.1 percent in Shanghai from its two-month low on Tuesday, while China Vanke <000002.SZ> gained 1.8 percent in Shenzhen. The improving mood, however, failed to lift the Hong Kong debut of China CNR Corp Ltd <601299.SS> <6199.HK>, the world's largest train maker by sales. The company's shares fell to HK$5.1, below the HK$5.17 offering price, itself at the lower end of the marketed HK$5.00-HK$6.20 range. In Hong Kong, Li & Fung <0494.HK> rose 2.8 percent in their best day in 9 weeks. The global exporter said the Hong Kong stock exchange would review its application for a separate listing of its global brands business, of which its shareholders will receive one share of the spin-off unit for every share they own in Li & Fung.
