LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Thursday more small interest rate cuts were possible.

"At present our base rate is just 2.5 percent and probably there is still room to maneouvre, there might be some other small cuts in the future," Matolcsy told a conference in London. Hungarian interest rates have fallen from a peak of 7 percent in August 2012. Prices fell in April for the first time since 1968, with inflation running at -0.1 percent.
