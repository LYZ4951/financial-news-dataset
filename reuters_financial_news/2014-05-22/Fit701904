May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Lowland Mortgage Backed Securities 1 B.V. (Lowland 1), Lowland Mortgage Backed Securities 2 B.V. (Lowland 2) and Lowland Mortgage Backed Securities 3 B.V. (Lowland 3), a series of Dutch RMBS transactions partially backed by the Nationale Hypotheek Garantie (NHG). The mortgages in the transactions were originated and serviced by SNS Bank N.V. [SRSNS.UL] (SNS, BBB+/Negative/F2) and its subsidiaries. NHG loans comprise 36% of the  current outstanding pool in Lowland 1 and around 1% in Lowland 2 and 3. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Performance  The affirmations reflect the performance of the underlying assets. As of the  April 2014 payment date, three-months plus arrears ranged from 0.91% (Lowland 1)  to 0.19% (Lowland 3) compared with Fitch's Dutch prime three-month plus arrears  figure of 0.83%. The outstanding balance of loans with properties sold at a loss  ranged between 0.25% (Lowland 1) to 0% (Lowland 2 and 3). The higher arrears in Lowland 1 are driven by the non-NHG portion of the pool.  Based on the loan-by-loan data received from SNS, the non-NHG portion of arrears  accounted for 81% of total arrears compared with their 64% share of the total  pool. To account for the better performance of NHG-loans, in its analysis Fitch  reduced the default probabilities of this portion of the portfolio.  Unhedged Transactions There is no swap in place to hedge the interest rate differential between the  notes and the mortgage loans in any of the transactions. Instead, the  proportions of fixed- and floating-rate notes issued are similar to the  proportions of fixed- and floating-rate loans in the pool, thereby providing  natural hedging for the interest rate risk, as fixed rate loan proceeds are used  to pay down the fixed rate notes and floating rate proceeds are used to pay down  the floating rate notes. Despite minimum weighted average margin and interest rate guarantees designed to  protect against a decline in portfolio yield provided by SNS and its  subsidiaries, Fitch has not given credit to this commitment. In its analysis,  the agency made conservative assumptions on the cash flow proceeds from the  portfolio. The analysis showed that the current credit enhancement is sufficient  to withstand the respective rating stresses.  Notes Amortisation Note amortisation in all the deals is sequential. As a the portfolios continue  to deleverage, Fitch expects the credit enhancement available to the notes to  increase further from levels seen in the latest investor reports.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Deterioration in asset performance may result from economic factors, in  particular the increasing effect of unemployment. A corresponding increase in  new foreclosures and the associated pressure on excess spread, reserve fund and  liquidity facility beyond Fitch's assumptions could result in negative rating  action, particularly for junior tranches.
