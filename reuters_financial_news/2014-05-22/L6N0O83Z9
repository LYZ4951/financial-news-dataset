LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - UK over-50s insurance firm Saga [IPO-SAGA.L] has priced its London listing at 185 pence ($3.12) a share, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, the bottom of its original price range.

A source told Reuters yesterday that a price of 185 pence would give Saga an equity value of 2.03 billion pounds. The company is owned by private equity firms Permira [PERM.UL], Charterhouse [CHCAP.UL] and CVC [CVC.UL]. [ID:nL6N0O74BI]
