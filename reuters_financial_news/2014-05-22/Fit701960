May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

AT&T's <T.N> agreement to buy DirecTV <DTV.O> is the latest in a wave of deals that highlight the growing appetite for content and pay-TV acquisitions among telecom operators, Fitch Ratings says. AT&Ts deal gives it the opportunity to capitalise on growth in mobile video and diversify its revenue stream, but deals in the more competitive European market are largely defensive to stabilise  fixed and mobile market shares, rather than generating profits from TV services. Telecom companies are using a variety of strategies to acquire this content.  Telefonica <TEF.MC> has offered to buy the struggling Spanish satellite operator  Digital+, while Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI> has agreed a content-distribution deal with Sky  Italia and BT is going a more direct route by bidding aggressively for sports  rights. AT&T's acquisition strengthens the company's position in the evolving video  market and diversifies AT&T's revenue stream, but the longer-term strategic  benefits are less clear, while the expected increase in leverage from the  transaction led us to place AT&T's 'A' IDR on Rating Watch Negative. The European pay-TV industry is under-penetrated compared with the US at around  40% of households covered. In particular, Southern European markets like Italy  and Spain have some of the lowest levels of pay-TV penetration in Europe. Under the agreement with Sky Italia, TI will distribute all Sky's content over  its fixed line and LTE mobile networks under a revenue-sharing model. This  approach means that TI does not have to invest significant amounts of capital.  The deal will help TI defend its market share by differentiating its offering  from rivals Vodafone and Wind and could accelerate the take-up of fibre.  However, TI's fibre network footprint remains small with a relatively slow  roll-out target. Combined with the low margins in content distribution for  telcos and the potential for increased competition from free-to-air broadcaster  Mediaset, this is likely to limit TI's ability to improve profitability via its  TV service. Telefonica's offer to acquire control of Digital+ would allow TEF to access  Digital+'s 1.6 million subscribers and its exclusive video content, including  Spanish football rights. The deal would support the company's key strengths of  fibre-to-the-home and premium TV content, helping to defend it against  competition from Vodafone/Ono, Jazztel and other regional cable operators.
