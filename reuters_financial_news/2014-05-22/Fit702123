May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The Chinese Ministry of Finance's (MOF)  decision to allow local and regional governments (LRGs) to issue bonds directly  on their own credit profile is a significant step forward in reforming LRG  budget management and ensuring greater fiscal transparency, Fitch Ratings says. The decision enables 10 designated LRGs to issue bonds independently in the  domestic market up to an annual limit set by the MOF. Unlike a separate pilot  scheme, launched in 2009, under which LRGs issued bonds under the aegis of the  MOF, debt-servicing responsibilities under this mandate is to be assumed by the  local governments themselves.  The designated local authorities are primarily from the wealthier eastern and  southern coastal regions including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, but the  less-developed provinces of Jiangxi and Ningxia in the central/western region  have also been included.  The issuance of LRG bonds is being allowed within a clearly established  regulatory framework. The bonds will have to be rated by ratings agencies, and  LRGs will be required to regularly disclose fiscal revenues and expenditures and  the size of their debt. Furthermore, the amount of local bond issuance is to be  approved by the State Council on an annual basis, and LRGs will be required to  report all credit-significant events to the Ministry of Finance. Enabling LRGs to issue debt has several key implications which are positive for  credit. First, it will encourage local governments to transfer some of their  sources of financing away from local government financing vehicles (LGFV) and  off-budget financing. The rapid growth of such funding (Chinese local government  debt reached around USD2.9trn as of latest national audit data, most of which  has been issued by LGFVs) is a potential risk for Chinese LRGs and a  sensitivitity factor for China's sovereign Local-Currency IDR ('A+').  Taking financing away from LGFVs and shadow banking, and placing debt issuance  under a clearly established central government oversight framework, will bring  much greater transparency to LRG fiscal accounts and debt. Notably, it will  provide a mechanism for the regular provision of data on aggregate LRG debt and  other key fiscal metrics. This in turn will enable the authorities to monitor  leverage and their debt-servicing abilities more efficiently - significant steps  towards addressing existing weaknesses in the LRG sector.   It also offers the potential for better management of the LRGs' asset/liability  maturities while bringing down borrowing costs. LGFV bonds are often short-dated  relative to the expected returns from the investments they are financing. As a  result, the new financing options should enable local authorities to more  effectively balance the needs of local economic development directly with the  LRG's leverage and debt-servicing capabilities. Off-budget financing through the  shadow banking sector also tends to be short term and with high interest.  In addition, we expect this pilot scheme to allow for more accurate pricing of  risk, in light of the differing credit profile of LRGs. Local bonds will more  accurately reflect the individual inherent creditworthiness of the authority  rather than the sovereign's potential support, as was the case with the other  issuance programme. If this pilot scheme is expanded, it will also allow for a  more transparent assessment of the Chinese LRG sector, and result in a more  sophisticated and responsible debt management policy.
