SAO PAULO, May 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian banks will fight any decision by the nation's top two courts on a landmark case involving disputed compensation for individuals' savings dating back two decades, industry group Febraban said on Thursday.

While saying it remained confident about a decision by the nation's Federal Supreme Court, STF, on the matter, Febraban said in a statement that banks will challenge Wednesday's ruling by the Superior Justice Court (STJ). It ruled that additional interest for millions of savers should be calculated from the date first-class lawsuits were filed in the early 1990s, not when individual claims were made starting in 2010, as the banks sought.
