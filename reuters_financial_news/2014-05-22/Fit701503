May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that EMEA corporate Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) are more stable and less prone to market sentiment than CDS-implied ratings (IRs), as they are driven by fundamental credit analysis on a through-the-cycle basis. The market's inherent sensitivity and sharp reaction to news flow drive greater  volatility in market- implied ratings, with effects exacerbated for small  companies and those operating in the eurozone periphery. On average, corporate  CDS IRs are one notch higher than Fitch's IDRs, which are often constrained by  sector-specific fundamental factors. Healthcare companies' CDS IRs especially benefit more than IDRs from the large  scale of their operations , regular M&A news flow and stable cash flows, and are  on average two notches higher than IDRs. This is because Fitch's IDRs factor in  each company's operating profile and credit metric evolution over a longer  period than CDS IRs. By contrast, the more cyclical natural resources sector's  average IDR is higher than the market-implied rating.  The TMT and utilities sectors, both on negative outlooks, show large individual  notch differentials between IDRs and CDS IRs. Fundamentals, such as intense  competition, mature markets and high capex in TMT, and regulatory pressure in  utilities, drive average IDRs substantially lower than CDS IRs. A notable  exception is companies operating in the eurozone periphery, which have  consistently lower CDS IRs than their IDRs. This is due to market over-reaction  to news flow amid recent economic weakness across the periphery and the fact  that peripheral issuers' CDS IRs are also influenced by ratings from other  rating agencies, some of which are constrained by their respective peripheral  sovereign ratings - contrasting with Fitch's more flexible approach to  corporate/sovereign constraints. The report also discusses key issuers with large notch differentials and the  differences in using credit spreads versus fundamentals in assessing credit  risk.
