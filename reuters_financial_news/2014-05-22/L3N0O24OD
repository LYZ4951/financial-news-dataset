May 22 (Reuters) - Originally a way for friends to share music and movies, online file sharing is now in high demand from big businesses seeking to swap costly data centers for secure storage in the cloud.

Washington-based market research company Osterman Research expects the global file synchronization and sharing market to double to about $80 billion by 2017. Eighty to 90 percent of this revenue will come from business. To tap this demand, several file-sharing startups are considering initial public offerings (IPOs) or seeking buyers.
