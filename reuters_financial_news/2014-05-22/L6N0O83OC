COPENHAGEN, May 22 (Reuters) - Danish software provider Simcorp <SIM.CO> reported on Thursday a drop in first-quarter operating profits due to lower sales of new licenses but kept its guidance for the full year.

The operating profit fell to 4.9 million euros ($66.96 million) from 7.0 million in the same period last year. Simcorp, which sells software to the financial sector, stood by a full-year outlook for revenue growth of 10 percent in local currencies and an operating profit margin of 24 percent in local currencies.
