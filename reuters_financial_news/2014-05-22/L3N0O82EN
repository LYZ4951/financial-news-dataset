The average rates on terms from overnight to one month rose by 0.05-0.46 percentage point against the previous week to 3.21-4.01 percent. The average rates on dollar loans were on a downward trend on almost all terms. The average rates on terms of overnight to three months dipped by 0.03-0.32 percentage point from a week earlier to 0.23-1.14 percent.  3- Over the week, the foreign exchange market was stable. The exchange rates rose at times, but were still well below the ceiling rate set by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). Demand and supply of foreign currencies were balanced (exports in the first four months rose 18.9 percent from last year while the trade surplus reached $2.05 billion; remittances as well as foreign direct and indirect investments continued to flow into Vietnam; the balance of payments surplus were high and is likely to remain surplus for the rest of 2014). Legitimate demand for foreign currencies of firms and citizens is satisfied fully and smoothly in a timely manner. SBV did not have to intervene in the foreign exchange market.
