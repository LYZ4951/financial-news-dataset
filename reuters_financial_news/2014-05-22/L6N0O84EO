LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> will next week launch the sale of about 25 percent of its TSB business via a stock market flotation with the pricing expected to be below book value, banking industry sources told Reuters.

The amount of stock sold is likely to be at the bottom end of the guidance on how much the bank would sell, according to the sources, reflecting a cooling of investor interest in UK company flotations in recent weeks following a flurry of activity earlier in 2014.
