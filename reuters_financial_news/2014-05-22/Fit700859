May 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned GuarantCo Limited (GuarantCo) an Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating of 'AA-'. The Outlook of the rating is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects GuarantCo's strong owners, solid capital position,  established track record of providing local-currency-guarantees to finance  private infrastructure projects in emerging markets and its low investment risk.  These strengths are partly offset by the company's fairly small size and  historically weak profitability. Although GuarantCo is backed by public institutions, it is run on a commercial  basis, thus allowing European countries to finance private sector projects in  low-income countries without committing their own funds directly. It is  indirectly owned by the development agencies of the UK (AA+/Stable), Switzerland  (AAA/Stable) and Sweden (AAA/Stable), via the Private Infrastructure Development  Group Trust (83.4%) and directly by the FMO (AAA/Negative) (16.6%).  The owners' commitment to GuarantCo is indicated by their capital contributions  made to GuarantCo to date and their plans to further increase paid-in capital to  USD330m at end-2016 from USD205m at end-2013. However, there is no formal  support, such as the subscription of callable capital (as for multilateral  development banks) or unconditional guarantee from the public shareholders to  support GuarantCo. Consequently, future financial support from the four  development agencies cannot be guaranteed. While the rating reflects strong and  committed sponsors, it is not aligned with that of the owners due to the absence  of explicit support. GuarantCo's capitalisation is strong with a net par to capital ratio (excluding  available capital from an USD450m counter-guarantee facility) at 0.8x at  end-2013. Fitch regards the drawn tranches of the counter-guarantee facility  (USD300m at end-2013) as equity in its capital assessment which results in a  very strong adjusted par to capital ratio of 0.3x. Although Fitch expects that  GuarantCo's capitalisation will weaken as it grows, it is expected to remain  commensurate with the company's rating. GuarantCo is viewed by Fitch as a small, highly specialised financial guarantor.  However, the company's size is not a limiting rating factor as it is a  public-sponsored organisation and its mission does not hinge on attaining  material business volumes. Its products are intended to support government  initiatives established by its sponsors.  As GuarantCo's primary objectives are to encourage private sector involvement in  the domestic financing of infrastructure projects and to promote local capital  market development, profitability is not a key performance metric. The company's  profitability has been weak in recent years, largely driven by the low interest  rate environment and fairly high fixed costs. However, the company is expected  to return to profitability, and a return on capital target has been established  over the longer-term at 3%-6%. The company provides guarantees for mainly non-USD denominated debt issued by  below-investment grade issuers ("high frequency, high severity" guarantee  portfolio) and it is exposed to unhedged currency risk. Fitch views this risk as  manageable as an 8% weakening/strengthening of the USD against  guarantee-denominated currencies would have affected net profit and equity by an  amount equivalent to only 3.8% of shareholders' funds at end-2013. However, it  is possible that currency risk will increase as the company grows, and Fitch  will continue to closely monitor this exposure. At end-2013, GuarantCo's investments consisted of cash (75%) and a US Treasury  backed money market fund. Fitch expects GuarantCo's investment risk to remain  low.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch views an upgrade of GuarantCo's rating as unlikely in the medium term  given the company's fairly small size. However, the extension of an explicit  support agreement by the company's ultimate government-backed owners could  result in an upgrade.
