May 22 (Reuters) - IMC Financial Markets has agreed to acquire Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N>'s rights to operate as a designated market maker in more than 600 NYSE-listed stocks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.

The Dutch high-speed trading firm paid under $30 million, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the deal. IMC also plans to hire about 15 floor brokers from Goldman Sachs. Designated market-makers, formerly known as "specialists",   operate both manually and electronically to facilitate price discovery during market openings, closings and during periods of substantial trading imbalances or instability for thousands of NYSE-listed stocks.  Goldman acquired the designated market-maker unit as part of its $6.5 billion purchase in 2000 of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg.  Goldman Sachs plans to remain a broker on the New York Stock Exchange's trading floor executing trades on behalf of clients, the paper said.
