TOKYO, May 22 (Reuters) - Japan Post Insurance is ramping up its investment in Japanese stocks and foreign bonds in a move that shows the government-controlled insurer - Japan's largest - is betting on the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policies in pursuit of higher returns, according to disclosures and a person with knowledge of the investment strategy.

Japan Post Insurance, which has the equivalent of $846 billion in assets, is increasing its investment in Japanese stocks by an estimated 300 billion to 350 billion yen, or up to $3.5 billion, in the fiscal year that began in April, a more than 50 percent rise from last year, according to the person, who asked not to be named because details of the developing portfolio shift have not been made public. The new money earmarked for stocks is about half of the insurer's planned investment in foreign bonds. Japan Post Insurance, known as Kampo in Japan, has also earmarked the equivalent $6.4 billion for new investment in overseas bonds, also representing a more than 50 percent increase, according to a plan vetted and released by a government oversight panel for the insurer in March. That investment plan did not specify an allocation target for equities. The move by Japan Post Insurance reflects the view that Abe's economic policies, including a continued programme of aggressive bond buying by the Bank of Japan, have brought Japan's capital markets to a tipping point and forced Japan's largest investors to take more risk to seek higher returns. A spokesman for Japan Post Insurance said the insurer does not discuss the details of its investment strategy as a matter of policy.
