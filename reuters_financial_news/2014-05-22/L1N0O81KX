May 22 (Reuters) - General Electric Co <GE.N> has agreed to extend its $16.9 billion bid for the power arm of France's Alstom <ALSO.PA> until  June 23 from June 2 at the request of the French government, the U.S. company said on Thursday.

GE said it agreed to the extension to facilitate discussions with the French government, which has given some resistance to GE's proposal.
