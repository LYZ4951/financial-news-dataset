HANOI, May 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged down 0.4 percent to close at 541.73 points on Thursday as investors took profit from stocks after a streak of four gains, analysts said.

Property firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> led the losses, with shares dipping 1.49 percent, followed by Hanoi-based lender BIDV <BID.HM> that fell 2.01 percent. "Investors are still cautious about the situation in the East Sea (South China Sea) so they secured profits near the index's resistance level of 550 points," said analyst Hoang Huy of ACB Securities. Selling slightly pushed up liquidity on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, analysts said. Volume reached 130 million shares on Thursday, above the five-day average level of 106 million, Reuters data showed. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung recently said his government was considering various "defence options" against China, including legal action, following the deployment of a Chinese oil rig to waters in the South China Sea that Hanoi also claims.
