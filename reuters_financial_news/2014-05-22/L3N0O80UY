SEOUL, May 22 (Reuters) - Seoul shares finished at their highest closing level in 5-1/2 months on Thursday, with risk appetite bolstered by minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting and China's better-than-expected factory activity report in May.

The won <KRW=> gained on demand by exporters and stock inflows, while caution over possible intervention by local authorities capped further strength. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,024.2 per dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.3 percent from Wednesday's 1,026.9.
