LISBON, May 22 (Reuters) - Concerns surrounding a holding company with a stake in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo relate to debt instruments issued by the holding company that were sold to BES clients, the chief executive of BES told a newspaper on Thursday.

Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado told business daily Jornal de Negocios that BES <BES.LS> sold the bonds without knowing that there were financial irregularities at the holding company Espirito Santo International (ESI).  "The bank did not know, nobody knew, and before carrying out the sale of the paper, we requested authorization" from Portuguese market regulators, Salgado said.  "We followed all rules when we placed the debt. We didn't know that there was such sickness as we have subsequently found inside Espirito Santo International," he said.  He did not say when the debt was sold or give further details of what had gone wrong at ESI, which is based in Luxembourg and has holdings in several Portuguese industries including an indirect stake in BES, the country's largest listed bank.  The problems at ESI emerged this week when BES issued a prospectus for a capital increase and listed potential risks around the operation. It warned of "reputational risks" for BES because an external auditor had found irregularities in ESI's accounts and concluded that the company "represents a serious financial situation". "There was serious negligence," Salgado told the paper, referring to ESI. "I don't think there was wilful misconduct."  "What needs to be done is to regularize things as quickly as possible," he said.  ESI could not be reached for comment. In the prospectus issued late on Tuesday by BES, there was a warning about the "reputational risks associated with the potential deterioration or perception of deterioration of the financial position of Espirito Santo International or its subsidiaries". "The financial situation of ESI may affect the reputation of BES and its shares," the document said.  Shares in BES have slumped since it announced last week it was planning a capital increase of up to 1.045 billion euros. They slid further on Thursday - the first day that the stock traded without the rights to the capital increase. At 1130 GMT, they were down 10 percent at 0.882 euro.  "This is an adjustment to the capital increase," said Paulo Rosa, a trader at Gobulling in Porto.
