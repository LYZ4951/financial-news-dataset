May 22 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian markets ended firmer on Thursday, while the Thai stock market saw foreign outflows for a third straight session as the country's army chief seized control of the government two days after he declared martial law.

Outflows stood at 1.9 billion baht ($58.52 million) on Thursday, extending the net foreign selling to $409.6 million after the army declared martial law on Tuesday.  After the market closed, Thailand's army seized control of the government, saying it had to restore order and push through reforms and a senior army official told Reuters the military would send troops and vehicles to escort protesters away from rally sites.
