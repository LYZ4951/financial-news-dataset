ABU DHABI, July 20 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD> (ADIB), the largest sharia-compliant lender in the emirate, beat analysts' estimates on Sunday as it posted a 22.6 percent jump in second-quarter net profit.

The lender, which in May got regulatory approval to purchase much of Barclays' <BARC.L> retail operations in the United Arab Emirates, made a net profit of 454.8 million dirhams ($123.8 million) in the three months to June 30 compared to 371 million dirhams in the same period of 2013, it said in a statement.
