DUBAI, July 20 (Reuters) - Dar al-Arkan <4300.SE>, Saudi Arabia's largest real estate developer by market value, reported a 17 percent rise in second-quarter net income on Sunday but widely missed analysts' forecasts.

Net profit in the three months to June 30 was 121.3 million riyals ($32.3 million) compared to 103.7 million in the same period a year earlier, it said in a bourse statement.  It attributed the rise to higher sales of properties at higher profit margins. It said higher non-operating income was offset by increases in payrolls, consultancy fees and higher finance charges. Six analysts polled by Reuters had forecast, on average, that Dar al-Arkan would record net profit of 209.8 million riyals in the quarter. [ID:nL6N0PP0Y6]
