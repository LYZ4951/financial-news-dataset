DUBAI, July 20 (Reuters) - Investors' hopes for strong second-quarter earnings may continue to buoy stock markets in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar on Sunday while Saudi Arabia's biggest listed company, Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) <2010.SE>, looks set to support its market with a results announcement that met analysts' forecasts.

Bets on positive results were major drivers of the rallies in the UAE and Qatar last week, when Dubai <.DFMGI> gained 7.2 percent, Abu Dhabi <.ADI> rose 3.8 percent and the Doha benchmark <.QSI> added 2.8 percent. Shares in Dubai construction firm Arabtec <ARTC.DU> are expected to resume trading after being suspended on Thursday pending a statement by major shareholder Aabar, which said on Sunday morning that it was studying a number of options for its stake. Many investors think Aabar will eventually buy part of the 28.85 percent stake held by former chief executive Hasan Ismaik; Aabar said on Sunday that any talks it might be having on a fresh investment would be confidential. [ID:nL6N0PV03K] The Dubai market showed on Thursday that interest in some other stocks could also boost the market. Bourse operator Dubai Financial Market <DFM.DU> may attract interest after saying after the close on Thursday that it had more than tripled its second-quarter net profit thanks to higher market trading volumes. [ID:L6N0PS3N0] Elsewhere, SABIC reported a 7 percent rise in second-quarter net income on Sunday to 6.46 billion riyals ($1.72 billion); that was in line with the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters, who had predicted a quarterly profit of 6.42 billion riyals. [ID:nL6N0PP0Y6]  There had been some concern about SABIC earnings after two of SABIC's subsidiaries, Yanbu National Petrochemical Co <2290.SE> and Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co <2020.SE>, missed analysts' forecasts.
