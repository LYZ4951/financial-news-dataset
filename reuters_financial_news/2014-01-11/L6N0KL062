Kiev, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign currency reserves rose to $20.416 billion on Dec. 31 from $18.791 billion as of November 30, the central bank said on Saturday.

The rise was mostly due to a $3 billion loan, which Ukraine received from Russia through the placement of two-year eurobonds last month.
