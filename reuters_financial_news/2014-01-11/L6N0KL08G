LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - British grocer WM Morrison <MRW.L>, under pressure since posting worse-than-expected Christmas sales, is set to face calls from a U.S. activist investor to shake-up its property portfolio, reported the Financial Times.

Hedge fund Elliot Associates and other activist investors have built up a stake in the supermarket chain and are pushing for it to sell off some of its freehold properties, the newspaper said on Saturday, citing people familiar with the situation.  A spokesman for Morrisons declined to comment on the story.  Morrisons, Britain's fourth largest grocer which lagged rivals over the Christmas trading period with a 5.6 percent slump in underlying sales, said in September it had launched a review of its property portfolio. [ID:nL6N0KJ1EC] [ID:nL6N0KJ1FD] It said then that it planned to continue to hold the majority of its core estate on a freehold basis but would manage its 9 billion pound ($15 billion) property portfolio on more active basis. The activist investors are pushing for Morrisons to go further and sell freehold properties, said the newspaper.
