DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Japanese inflation should hit the Bank of Japan's target of 2 percent within two years, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda said on Saturday, and he voiced optimism about the growth outlook.

"Now the situation has completely changed and I'm quite optimistic as far as economic growth and appropriate two percent inflation are concerned," Kuroda told the World Economic Forum in Davos.
