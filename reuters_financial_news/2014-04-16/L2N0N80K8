ATLANTA, April 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should try to make its communications on the expected path of interest rates and the economy consistent with its policy statements, a top official at the central bank said on Wednesday.

Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, acknowledged the most recent projections for interest rates were out of step with the Fed's pledges on policy.
