BRUSSELS, April 16 (Reuters) - German utilities RWE <RWEG.DE> and E.ON <EONGn.DE> want to sell their interests in Luxembourg energy provider Enovos, the latter said.

Enovos, which also has operations in Germany, France and Belgium, said in a written reply to Reuters that the two German groups intended to start a process to sell their respective interests.  RWE has an 18.36 percent stake in Enovos, which was created in 2009, and E.ON has 10.0 percent.  ArcelorMittal sold its 23.48 percent stake in 2012 to a fund managed by AXA Private Equity, now called Ardian, for 330 million euros ($456.2 million).
