BRUSSELS, April 16 (Reuters) - European Union regulators opened on Wednesday an investigation into state aid granted to Latvian Banks AS Parex banka [PAREX.UL] [CDEBK.UL] and Citadele banka, saying the measure may have violated EU state aid rules.

The European Commission, tasked with ensuring a level playing field in the 28-country bloc, said Latvian authorities may also have failed to carry out the banks' restructuring in line with their pledge to the EU watchdog. Parex banka was split into a good bank named Citadele banka and a bad bank called Parex, which was later renamed Reverta, in 2010 under an overhaul plan agreed with the Commission in return for approving its bailout.
