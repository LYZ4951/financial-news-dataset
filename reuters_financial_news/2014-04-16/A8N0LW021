ATHENS, April 16 (Reuters) - Greece's bank bailout fund HFSF has given the green light to plans by National Bank (NBG) <NBGr.AT> to proceed with a share offering of up to 2.5 billion euros to plug a capital shortfall, a senior banking source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.

Greece's biggest lender, which must plug a 2.18 billion euro ($3.03 billion) capital shortfall under the terms of the country's international bailout, has picked Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> as global coordinators for the offering, bankers have previously said. [ID:nL6N0N61VF]
