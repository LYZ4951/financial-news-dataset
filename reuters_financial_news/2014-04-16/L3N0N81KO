BANGKOK, April 16 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets mostly edged higher on Wednesday after China reported economic growth a touch above forecast while Malaysian shares reversed early gains ahead of March inflation data.

Malaysia's main index <.KLSE> fell 0.2 percent at midday amid selling in recent gainers such as Tenaga Nasional <TENA.KL> and Telekom Malaysia <TLMM.KL>. Malaysia's annual inflation rate in March is expected to hold steady against the previous month, when consumer prices climbed to a 32-month high, reflecting the higher costs of food, transportation and electricity. [ID:nL3N0N812V] In Bangkok, the SET index <.SETI> rose 0.5 percent to around a one-week high as investors selectively bought shares of banking companies that are due to report their January-March earnings from this week. The banking subindex <.SETB> was up 0.7 percent. Among the top market boosters, shares of Kasikornbank <KBANK.BK> gained 1.1 percent, with 25 out of 26 analysts rating the stock a 'buy' or 'strong buy', Thomson Reuters data showed.
