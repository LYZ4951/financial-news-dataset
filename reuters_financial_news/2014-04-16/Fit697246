April 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed State Oil Company of  the Azerbaijan Republic's [STOAR.UL] (SOCAR) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'BBB-', Short-term IDR at 'F3' and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB-'. The  Outlook on the Long-term IDR is Stable. The ratings of SOCAR, a wholly state-owned national oil company of Azerbaijan  (BBB-/Stable), are aligned with the sovereign's. SOCAR is a mid-size integrated  oil company with 2013 hydrocarbon production of 255 thousand barrels of oil  equivalent per day (mboepd) and a number of assets in midstream, downstream,  chemicals and retail.  SOCAR controls Petkim, Turkey's only chemical producer, and is constructing a 10  million ton capacity STAR refinery in Turkey. It is also a party to several  production-sharing agreements (PSAs) in Azerbaijan and receives specified  volumes of oil, natural gas and gas condensate free of charge.  Under Fitch's conservative forecasts SOCAR's credit metrics will deteriorate  moderately in 2013-2015, with funds from operations (FFO) net leverage  increasing to 1.9x in 2016, from 1.5x in 2012 and FFO interest coverage  declining to 9.6x in 2016, from nearly 16.8x in 2012, before taking into  consideration any divestments.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Ratings Aligned with Sovereign's SOCAR's ratings are aligned with Azerbaijan's, as it represents the state's  interests in the strategically important oil and gas industry. SOCAR maintains  close ties with the government and the State Oil Fund of the Republic of  Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) to make financial and investment decisions.   Funding of SOCAR's Projects According to a recent decree by the President of Azerbaijan, SOFAZ and SOCAR  will set up a joint venture (JV). SOCAR's cash contribution to the JV will be  limited to AZN49m or 49% of JV's charter capital. SOCAR will also transfer to  the JV its stakes in a number of ongoing projects, eg, a 10% stake in Shah Deniz  PSA and gas pipeline projects. Thereafter, SOFAZ will lend additional funds to  the JV, which it will use to fund its share of investments in the  above-mentioned projects. Although there is no specific decision yet regarding  the funding of SOCAR's other announced projects, eg, the oil-gas processing and  petrochemical complex (OGPC) in Baku, we expect that these projects will also be  funded mostly by SOFAZ. Fitch's sovereign analysts estimate that SOFAZ's assets  totalled about USD40bn at end-2013 and expect further moderate growth in  sovereign assets.  SOCAR has recently agreed funding for the 10 million ton STAR refinery in Turkey  - over USD5bn in commitments from international banks, partially covered by  Export Credit Agencies. SOCAR expects to make an additional USD1bn equity  contribution for its 60% stake in the project, which is scheduled to be  completed in 2017. 'BB' Standalone Profile Fitch views SOCAR's standalone profile as commensurate with the mid-'BB'  category, reflecting its limited reserves, declining brownfield production, aged  refineries, but also an extensive domestic pipeline network, an expanding  international downstream and retail portfolio, and adequate credit metrics. In  2013, SOCAR's total hydrocarbon output (excluding equity stakes) was 255  thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboepd), flat on previous year's  levels. While SOCAR's upstream is weaker and its lifting costs are higher than  that of 'BB'-rated Russian peers, this is partially compensated by profits from  its midstream and downstream operations.  Gas Replaces Oil Under our base rating case, we expect SOCAR's own (excluding JVs) oil production  to decline gradually in 2014-2016 from the depletion of existing brownfields in  Azerbaijan, SOCAR's only upstream region. At the same time, we forecast higher  natural gas production from Azerbaijan's PSAs, in particular the Stage 2 of the  Shah Deniz PSA. In December 2013, the Shah Deniz Stage 2 partners approved the  final investment decision with a USD28bn cost estimate, including the South  Caucasus Pipeline expansion. Once completed, the project aims to increase  production by 16 billion cubic meters of gas and 4 million tons of gas  condensate starting from late 2018.   Large Capex, Higher Leverage We conservatively estimate that SOCAR will spend over AZN7bn (USD9bn) on capex  in 2013-2016. The company has little capex flexibility as most funds are  earmarked for its upstream business to arrest brownfield production decline, to  meet its obligations under the PSAs and to complete projects that are already  underway, including the construction of the STAR refinery. We forecast that  under Fitch's oil price deck of USD96 per barrel of oil (bbl) in 2014, USD91/bbl  in 2015 and USD85/bbl in 2016, SOCAR's FFO net leverage will reach 1.9x in 2016,  up from 1.5x in 2012.  RATING SENSITIVITES Positive: Future developments that may result in positive rating action include: -An increase in state support through eg, government guarantees for a large  portion of the company's debt, coupled with a sovereign rating upgrade Negative: Future developments that may result in negative rating action include: -Weakening state support -An aggressive investment programme and/or acquisitions resulting in a  significant and sustained deterioration of stand-alone credit metrics  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Per draft IFRS accounts, SOCAR had AZN1,252bn of cash at 31 December 2013, which  was insufficient to cover its short-term debt of AZN1,459m on that date. Of the  total cash and restricted cash at end-2013, AZN474m was held at the state-owned  International Bank of Azerbaijan (BB/Stable), a related party. SOCAR's  short-term debt at end-2013 accounted for 29% of its gross debt, down from 40%  at end-2012, following the placement in 2013 of a USD1bn 4.75% coupon 10-year  bond.
