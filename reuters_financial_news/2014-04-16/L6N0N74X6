BUDAPEST, April 16 (Reuters) - Operators in Hungary's financial sector are having to rethink their strategies as the newly re-elected government is unlikely to change the main tack of its tough bank policies, a top banker told Reuters.

Heinz Wiedner, Chief Executive of the Hungarian unit of Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank <RBIV.VI>, said the ruling centre-right Fidesz party has signalled more of the same policies that have penalised banks since 2010. The previous government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban imposed a huge windfall tax on the financial sector, a separate tax on financial transactions, and also made banks foot the bill for a major repayment scheme for foreign currency borrowers, which caused banks losses of over 1 billion euros ($1.4 bln). "I cannot expect any fundamental change in the way economic policies and financial policies are being made in this country," said Wiedner, adding that making money again would require a new approach to banking. But Wiedner said he expected "some adjustments", possibly in the tax base of the bank levy, which is now charged based on the banks' 2009 balance sheet totals. Those totals are way higher than current levels. Raiffeisen Hungary made a net loss of 47 billion forints ($211 million) in 2012, and last year it posted a loss of 31 billion forints. It sees profitability returning only in 2016. "We see in the medium term the possibility here to become profitable again and not to be a burden for the group," he said. Banks could sell or gradually unwind businesses they no longer consider profitable, allowing others to take over and leading to a slow consolidation in the sector without anyone necessarily leaving the Hungarian market, Wiedner said. Beside Raiffeisen, banks operating in the country include units of Belgium's KBC <KBC.BR>, Austria's Erste Bank <ERST.VI>, Italy's Unicredit <CRDI.MI> and Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, as well as the country's home-bred top lender, OTP <OTPB.BU>.  Central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy predicted last year that as many as four big foreign banks would probably exit the country within 18 months, and one of his directors confirmed last week that a consolidation was indeed likely in the next year or so.

[ID:nL5N0KV0YU]  PIECEMEAL CONSOLIDATION "Selling portfolios is a possibility," he said. "That kind of concentration I can see (leaving) fewer players in certain areas. Not every bank has to provide personal loans, credit cards, mortgages - they can concentrate on some parts which they think they can do well." So far most of Hungary's larger banks have been universal banks, offering a more or less complete list of services. Wiedner said slimming down and focusing on less capital-intensive but profitable business segments, including financial services other than lending, was attractive for Raiffeisen, too. Private banking asset management was one such area, he said. However, the bank wants to stay a major player in corporate lending, where it is one of the biggest participants with a market share of 10-11 percent, he said. New lending to companies is up by 4-5 percent this year. "I think the main turn (issue) will be: can you stabilise or start to increase your revenues again - with a lower overall balance sheet?" he said. "We are not looking at absolute profitability so much as the usage of the capital and return on capital." "So you're changing the profile of your business to become profitable at a lower level. But in the end you cannot shrink that much because you have certain fixed costs, so you have to make sure your gross income does not continue to drop as the composition changes."
