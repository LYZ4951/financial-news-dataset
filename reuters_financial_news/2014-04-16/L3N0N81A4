HANOI, April 16 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> dropped 1.49 percent by midday on Wednesday as cautious investors offloaded shares following recent falls.

The index closed at its lowest level in near two weeks on Tuesday, falling for the fourth consecutive session."Given the lack of supportive information and profits gained earlier this month, investors have been selling shares to stay safe," said analyst Tran Minh Hoang at Vietcombank Securities. Most stocks lost ground in the morning session, led by Vietnam's largest listed firm PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM> dipping 1.08 percent. Hanoi-based lender Vietcombank <VCB.HM> fell 2.33 percent and food producer Masan Group Corp <MSN.HM> lost 2.07 percent. But the index is unlikely to drop below 560 points as bargain hunting around this level is expected to be strong, Hoang said. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).
