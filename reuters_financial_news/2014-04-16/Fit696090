April 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

A market-led rationing of foreign capital is the most  immediate threat to the Russian corporate sector from the crisis in Ukraine,  Fitch Ratings says. However, a detailed analysis of the liquidity profiles of  Fitch-rated Russian companies shows that the sector as a whole is well-placed to  withstand a protracted reduction of foreign capital inflows. Since the start of the crisis credit default swaps on Russian bonds have widened  by over a third, reflecting growing risk perceptions, and we have heard  anecdotal evidence that Western banks are looking at the country with a more  critical eye. While this response from international investors has been muted so  far, it does highlight the risk that foreign capital could become scarce if the  crisis escalates. We believe this is a more immediate risk than comprehensive  trade or financial sanctions, which would come at a very high price for both  Russia and the rest of the world. On the whole, Fitch-rated Russian companies have fairly robust financial  profiles and most have sufficient liquidity to withstand a complete closure of  the refinancing market for the rest of 2014. Our analysis indicates six out of  55 would have a liquidity gap in 2014. The most notable is Sibur, a regular  international borrower, which was in the process of negotiating a refinancing of  its bank lines as the crisis started. Given Sibur's standing in the Russian  economy we would expect it to retain access to the Russian bank market, borne  out in early April by its closure of a RUB27bn loan from a Russian bank. The others which will need to refinance in 2014 are Miratorg, Sodrugestvo,  Russian Helicopters, Transtelecom and Federal Passenger Company. A further  fifteen companies would need to refinance in 2015. Russian banks have the ability to replace some foreign borrowing. However,  annual corporate debt repayments to foreign lenders are around USD70bn-90bn,  which is close to our 2014 forecast for Russian banks' new corporate lending of  USD90bn-100bn, so banks would only be able to refinance a portion of corporates'  foreign borrowing given their other commitments. The state, with its USD486bn of foreign currency reserves, would have much more  firepower to support the banking system and corporate sector. First Deputy Prime  Minister Igor Shuvalov has said the government would be more selective in  providing support this time than it was following the 2008 crisis. But we  believe there is a strong propensity to support national champions and  strategically important companies, especially in cases where foreign creditors  would receive a claim on the shares of these entities if they defaulted.
