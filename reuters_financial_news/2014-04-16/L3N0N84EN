April 16 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp's <COF.N> quarterly profit rose about 10 percent as the credit card issuer set aside less money to cover soured loans.

The company's net income available to common stockholders rose to $1.14 billion, or $1.96 per share, for the first-quarter ended March 31, from $1.04 billion, or $1.77 per share, a year earlier. Total net revenue fell about 3.3 percent to $5.37 billion. [ID:nPn6k3TYt]
