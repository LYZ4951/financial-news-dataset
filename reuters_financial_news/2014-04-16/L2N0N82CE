NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> said on Wednesday that it will announce a new service with electronic payments provider Euronet Worldwide Inc <EEFT.O> on Thursday, but gave no other details.

Neither Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, nor Euronet, would comment ahead of a conference call for media, investors and analysts on Thursday morning.
