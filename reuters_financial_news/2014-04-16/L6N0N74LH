LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - British households feel under the least financial pressure in more than five years, due to lower inflation and the prospect of higher wages, a monthly survey showed on Wednesday.

Financial data company Markit said its Household Finance Index rose to 43.1 in April from 41.9 in March, reaching its highest level since the survey started in February 2009. While the index has risen markedly over the past few months, the mood was still pessimistic overall, with any reading below 50 representing households feeling worse off. The survey came out a day after official data showed that consumer price inflation sank to a four-year low of 1.6 percent in March. Markit said lower inflation was a major reason behind the improvement in households' outlook.

Households did not report higher earnings, but did describe more workplace activity, which Markit said pointed towards future wage rises.
