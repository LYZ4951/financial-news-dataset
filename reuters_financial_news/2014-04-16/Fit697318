April 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed F-E Gold S.r.l.'s [FEGLD.UL] (F-E Gold) notes, as follows:  EUR134.3m class A2 notes affirmed at 'A+sf'; Outlook Negative EUR26.9m class B notes affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Negative EUR4.9m class C notes affirmed at 'BBsf'; Outlook revised to Stable from  Negative  F-E Gold is a securitisation of performing leases on real estate, auto and  equipment assets originated in 2006. To date, the real estate pool accounts for  99.6% of the collateral. The leases pay mainly floating rate with monthly or  quarterly instalments. The notes pay quarterly at a floating rate based on  Euribor.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Since Fitch's last review in May 2013, the transaction has begun to show signs  of stabilisation. Annual defaults are 2% of the outstanding pool (compared with  4.8% in 2012) and losses realised are 0.15% due to the continuing inflow of  recoveries. In addition, the transaction cleared its outstanding principal  deficiency ledger in April 2013 and has not had a shortfall since. The  transaction has continued to build up credit enhancement (CE) from the static  EUR15m reserve fund, albeit at a much slower pace due to the pro rata pay down  of the notes. Fitch believes the current stabilisation in the pool performance  supports the affirmation of the notes.  However, should the stable performance continue, the transaction will continue  to amortise pro rata. This leaves the senior and mezzanine notes more vulnerable  to potential tail risk compared with the junior notes, hence the Outlook on the  class A and B notes remains Negative. As it is less of an issue for the class C  notes, their Outlook has been revised to Stable.  RATING SENSITIVITIES In Fitch's rating sensitivity analysis, expected remaining defaults were assumed  at 4% per annum with a weighted average life of three years, in line with  Fitch's negative view on the Italian SME sector. Based on the original principal  balance plus new purchases, this would result in an updated lifetime expectation  of 10%. Expected impact upon the note ratings of increased defaults (class A2/B/C): Current rating: 'A+sf'/'BBBsf'/'BBsf' Increase base case defaults by 10%: 'A+sf'/'BB+sf'/'BB-sf' Increase base case defaults by 25%: 'A-sf'/'BBsf'/'B+sf' Expected impact upon the note ratings of reduced recoveries (class A/B/C): Current rating: 'A+sf'/'BBBsf'/'BBsf' Reduce base case recovery by 10%: 'A+sf'/'BB+sf'/'BBsf' Reduce base case recovery by 25%: 'A+sf'/'BB+sf'/'BB-sf' Expected impact upon the note ratings of increased defaults and reduced  recoveries (class A/ B/C): Current rating: 'A+sf'/'BBBsf'/'BBsf' Increase default base case by 10%; reduce recovery base case by 10%:  'Asf'/'BB+sf'/'BB-sf'
