LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - European shares advanced on Wednesday to bounce back from the previous session's losses after China reported economic growth a touch above forecasts, while a rise in retailer Tesco <TSCO.L> also lifted markets.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which progressed by 16 percent last year and hit a near six-year high of 1,355.29 points earlier this month, was up by 0.9 percent at 1,319.08 points in early session trading. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> also rose 1 percent, to 3,122.50 points. China's economy grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in the first quarter of 2014, official data showed on Wednesday, with signs of waning momentum already prompting limited government action to steady the world's second-largest economy.

A 4 percent rise in Tesco gave one of the biggest lifts to the FTSEurofirst 300 index, as some traders said Tesco's fall in profits was not as steep as some had feared.
