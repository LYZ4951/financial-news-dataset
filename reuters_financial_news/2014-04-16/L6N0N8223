LJUBLJANA, April 16 (Reuters) - Slovenia's banks will pass Europe-wide stress tests which are due to be carried out this year, Bank of Slovenia vice-governor Stanislava Zadravec Caprirolo told a banking conference on Wednesday.

"The results (of the EU stress tests) should confirm that step (bank overhaul) was completed successfully," the central bank official said.
