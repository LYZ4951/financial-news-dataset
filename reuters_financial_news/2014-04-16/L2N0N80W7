SAO PAULO, April 16 (Reuters) - Stelo SA, an e-commerce payment processor launched on Wednesday, aims to grab 3.3 percent of Brazil's market for payments and money transfers made through the Internet by 2016, taking advantage of demand for alternative means of payment, an executive told Reuters.

The size of the market, which provides consumers and companies with electronic alternatives to paying with cash, checks and money orders, is currently an annual 52 billion reais ($23.3 billion) in Brazil. Marcelo Noronha, Bradesco's senior vice president for cards, estimates the market could reach 75 billion reais in two years. Stelo is another venture between state-run Banco do Brasil <BBAS3.SA> and Bradesco <BBDC4.SA> to develop more niches in Brazil's burgeoning card payment processing industry, which is valued at about $400 billion a year. Both banks have worked in a series of ventures through their joint investment holding company Cia Brasileira de Soluções e Serviços SA (CBSS). "This is a product that will add value to the chain of investments we have made through CBSS and, in general, for Bradesco's card operations," Noronha said. "The earnings impact in the first years of Stelo might be negligible for the bank - what we really want to create is value, and Stelo gives us that." According to Noronha, Stelo is Latin America's first company of its kind created by banks. Cielo SA <CIEL3.SA>, Brazil's largest merchant acquirer and controlled by both banks, could join Stelo by September, by taking a 30 percent stake, he noted. The move is subject to regulatory approval. Stelo plans to provide so-called digital wallet services by which it expects to help consumers make their online purchases using credit and debit cards as well as prepaid vouchers. The venture will compete in Brazil with PayPal, a subsidiary of eBay Inc <EBAY.O>, and local wallet service providers PagSeguro and MercadoPago. Stelo will soon begin testing its platform with 200,000 clients and expects to be operating fully during the second half of the year, Noronha said.
