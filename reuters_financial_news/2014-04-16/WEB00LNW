FRANKFURT, April 16 (Reuters) - German industrial machinery and process engineering group GEA Group <G1AG.DE> said it has agreed to sell its heat exchangers division, with an enterprise value of about 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion), to private equity investor Triton.

Two people familiar with the matter had told Reuters on Tuesday that Frankfurt-based private equity group Triton had beat out a rival consortium made up of buyout group EQT and industrial services group Bilfinger <GBFG.DE>. [ID:nWEB00LN6]
