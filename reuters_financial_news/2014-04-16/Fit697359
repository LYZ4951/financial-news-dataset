April 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings said that continued steady performance of non-Japan Asia structured finance (SF) transactions resulted in six affirmations in 1Q14. In total, four publicly rated SF tranches from four transactions were affirmed with Stable Outlooks. Two short-term SC tranches were affirmed.   The affirmation of three tranches from three South Korean credit card ABS  transactions reflected Fitch's view that the performance of the underlying  assets has remained well within expectations, and that credit enhancement is  sufficient to support the current ratings. Delinquencies have been low and  payment rates have remained stable for all three transactions since closing.  Improved economic growth and low unemployment rates in South Korea have  continued to support the underlying transactions, despite high household debt  levels.  The affirmation of class A from Silver Oak [SILOA.UL], a CMBS transaction backed by Raffles  City Singapore, reflected adequate cash flows from the underlying properties,  which have been above Fitch's stabilised cash flow assumptions since closing in  June 2011. Fitch's stressed debt service coverage ratio and loan-to-value ratio  for Silver Oak continue to meet the agency's criteria thresholds.  The affirmation of two tranches from Taishin Collateralised Bond Obligations  Special Purpose Trust 7 and 10 reflected the short maturity of the underlying  bonds as well as the broadly stable credit quality of key counterparties in both  SPTs. Both SPTs are due to mature in May 2014.   Fitch reviewed proposed amendments to the structure of DCS Asset Funding Pte.  Ltd. (DCS), which is backed by credit card and charge card receivables  originated by DCS in Singapore. The amendments include an extension of the  revolving period to September 2016 and of the legal final maturity to September  2018, and an increase of the working capital facility to SGD10m. Fitch revisited  its base case assumptions for charge-off rate, gross yield and monthly payment  rate based on DCS's historical data from February 2002 to September 2013. Credit  enhancement for each class remains commensurate with each note's rating stress.  Fitch withdrew its rating on the class C bond from E. Sun Bank 2007-2 CBO  Securitisation Special Purpose Trust following the termination of the trust. The Outlooks for all SF ratings in non-Japan Asia remain Stable, supported by  strong credit enhancement levels and generally firm economic backdrop across the  region, with India being the one jurisdiction that has experienced more stress  in SF international ratings than the rest of the region. Average 90+ days past  due delinquency levels reached 3.85% as of November 2013, compared with 2.00% a  year earlier. In spite of the higher delinquency experience, all Indian SF  ratings remain stable, supported by the rapid pace of CE build up in each  transaction. Fitch will closely monitor the developments in asset performance in  this sector.
