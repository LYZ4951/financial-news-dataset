MOSCOW, April 16 (Reuters) - M.video <MVID.MM>, Russia's biggest consumer electronics retailer, said on Wednesday its first-quarter sales growth kept pace with growth in the previous quarter despite weakening consumer confidence.

M.video said sales rose 8 percent to 47 billion roubles ($1.3 billion) as it opened a net seven stores and increased online-based sales by 113 percent, year-on-year.
