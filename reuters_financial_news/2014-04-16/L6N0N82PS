VIENNA, April 16 (Reuters) - Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service raised on Wednesday its outlook for Austrian bank BAWAG PSK's [CCMLPB.UL] long-term debt to 'positive' and affirmed its 'Baa2' rating, citing high probability that Austria would again support the bank if needed.

It noted the bank's sizeable share of national deposits and its importance to the country's payment system. BAWAG, majority owned by U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management [CBS.UL], is one of six Austrian lenders due to come under the direct supervision of the European Central Bank from November.
