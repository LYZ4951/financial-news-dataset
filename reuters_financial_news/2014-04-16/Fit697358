April 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says its rated Japanese structured finance (SF) and structured credit (SC) transactions remained mostly stable in 1Q14, with 11 rating affirmations and two downgrades to 'Dsf'. The class D and E notes of GK Orso Funding CMBS 7, a CMBS transaction, were  downgraded to 'Dsf' from 'CCsf' and 'Csf', respectively, following the principal  loss on the remaining defaulted loans. Fitch withdrew its ratings on this  transaction due to lack of investor interest. The 11 affirmations mostly reflected Fitch's view that the available credit  enhancement is sufficient to support the current ratings. The affirmations were  for seven tranches from two RMBS transactions, two tranches from two CMBS  transactions and two SC transactions. The Outlooks for Japanese SF ratings remain mostly Stable, with a limited number  of exceptions: Negative Outlooks on a SC transaction and a CMBS tranche as well  as Positive Outlooks on five tranches from four CMBS transactions.
