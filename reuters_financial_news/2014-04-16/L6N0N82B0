CAIRO, April 16 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound weakened at a central bank dollar sale <CBEO> but held steady on the black market on Wednesday, after hitting a six-month low <EGP=> last week.

The central bank said it sold dollars at a cut-off price of 6.9750 pounds, weaker than the rate of 6.9702 pounds at its last sale on Monday. Dollar shortages have been fuelling a thriving black market. A trader on the parallel market said the dollar was offered for 7.49 pounds on Wednesday, the same level as sales on Monday. The central bank sold $38.3 million on Wednesday, it said. It had offered $40 million. Egypt's foreign currency reserves reached $17.414 billion in March. That compares with $17.307 billion in February and $36 billion before the uprising that led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Egypt's annual urban consumer inflation rate stood at 9.8 percent in March, unchanged from February, the country's official statistics agency, CAPMAS, said last week. Egypt's M2 money supply rose 17.02 percent in the year to the end of February, the central bank said last month. [ID:nL5N0MT2VU]
