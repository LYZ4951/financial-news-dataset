BEIJING, April 16 (Reuters) - China shares closed a touch higher on Wednesday after slightly better-than-expected first-quarter growth data eased worries about a dramatic slowdown in the Chinese economy.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.2 percent at 2,105.12 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 0.1 percent. China's economy grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, above expectations of 7.3 percent.[ID:nL3N0N809C] It was the slowest pace of growth in six quarters but still wasn't enough to raise expectations of further stimulus, limiting further impetus for stock market gains. Mainland-listed securities firms outperformed, with several brokerages gaining more than 3 percent in early trade.
