TOKYO, April 16 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average extends gains on Wednesday following vague comments from Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso on the country's $1.26-trillion government pension fund, which traders took to mean that it could step up stock buying.

The benchmark Nikkei <.N225> rose to as high as 14,334.46, or 2.4 percent above its previous close, after Aso told the parliament the pension fund will "make a move" in the stock market from June.
