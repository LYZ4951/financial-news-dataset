April 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed UK-based WPP plc's <WPP.L> (WPP)  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has  also affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of the bonds issued by WPP Finance  S.A. [WPPFC.UL], WPP Finance UK, WPP 2008 Ltd [WPPBH.UL] and WPP Finance 2010 at 'BBB+'. WPP's ratings are supported by a leading industry position, strong portfolio of  advertising, measurement, market research and brand management businesses, sound  financial metrics and a well-communicated corporate strategy.  Following the Publicis Omnicon merger (which is expected to close some time in  2014) WPP will rank as the industry's second largest global advertising holding  company (GHC), with WPP exhibiting strong company specific traits along with  measured financial policies. Notwithstanding a recently announced increase in  targeted share buybacks, Fitch expects that shareholder distributions and  acquisitions will be managed within the company's stated leverage (average net  debt to EBITDA) policy of 1.5x to 2x.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Scale, Breadth and Diversity As one of the industry's largest GHCs, WPP's ratings are supported by its scale,  breadth of business and geographical diversity. The company has a balanced mix  of creative (advertising and media investment) and so called non-creative (brand  management, consultancy, market research and measurement) businesses. The  company understands the need to invest (acquire) businesses in faster-growing  markets and quickly evolving media platforms while at the same time being able  to provide global advertising customers solutions across a complex mix of  businesses and disciplines.Growth of Digital The company has built a strong position in digital media both through  acquisition and organic investment - an important strategy for any GHC in light  of the importance of, and growth expectations, for online advertising. In 2013  new media accounted for 35% of WPP's overall sales and the company has a  medium-term target of 40%-45% revenues. The rapidly changing world of social  media, the speed with which mobile advertising is increasing, the degree to  which these platforms are driving audience fragmentation, contextual advertising  and the potential to dis-intermediate traditional advertising formats all  underline their strategic importance for GHCs.   Emerging Markets Equally significant is an established presence and focus on emerging markets, in  light of the maturity of western European (36% of 2013 sales) and North American  (34%) markets. The company raised its target for revenue in its faster-growing  markets in 2011 to 40%-45% of group sales from 30% in FY13. A growing middle  class and increasing consumption trends in these markets underline the  importance of WPP's ability to offer a complete set of solutions for  multinational and domestically based clients alike by combining the scale  economies of a global agency with requisite local knowledge. While the increased  exposure to emerging markets gives rise to FX-related volatility and potentially  more acute cyclical effects, Fitch acknowledges the stronger underlying margin  and long term growth potential of these markets.   FX Risk WPP's 4Q13 results were impacted by unfavourable FX movements. These movements  affected the company's revenues, but also its margin as WPP's emerging markets  operations earn a higher margin than operations in more developed countries. WPP  funds itself in USD, GBP and euro-denominated debt. Unless they reverse, the  adverse currency movements witnessed towards end-2013 will act as a headwind for  the company in 2014. While Fitch's rating case assumes underlying growth of 3%  or more in 2014, with a further 2% to 3% of growth provided by bolt-on  acquisitions, we envisage these effects will be largely offset by negative FX -  the impact of which will be felt most strongly through the first nine months of  the year. Slower Margin Improvements WPP has lowered its expectations for margin improvement to 30 bps per annum from  50 bps. in 2014. Adverse FX movements have affected reported margins; guidance  is, however, provided on a pre-FX basis, with the company indicating increased  pressure from clients and competition slowing the improvement of its organic  operating margin. Margin performance is nonetheless healthy and compares well  with peers. Reduced expectations for further margin improvement do not currently  impact WPP's rating.  Shareholder Distributions & M&A Management has identified M&A, dividends and buybacks as its priority uses of  free cash flow while managing its balance sheet within its target leverage. The  company has increased its share buyback target for 2014 to 2%-3% of outstanding  shares from 1%, and its target dividend pay-out ratio to 45% from 40%. The  budget for new acquisitions remains at GBP300m-GBP400m in 2014, with the  company, in Fitch's view, showing a disciplined approach to financial policy in  recent years. The business generates healthy levels of free cash flow and  Fitch's rating case assumes that distributions and M&A will be managed within  its stated leverage (average net debt / EBITDA) range of 1.5x to 2x.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating actions  include: -Events leading to average net debt/EBITDA trending consistently and materially  above 2x -A weakened operating profile or a change in financial policy, more so than M&A  or cyclically driven trends, which would put pressure on the ratings Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: -Notwithstanding a strong industry position, diversification and a flexible cost  base, the company's financial policy - balancing the need to invest in  acquisitions, a progressive distribution policy and a measured leverage profile
