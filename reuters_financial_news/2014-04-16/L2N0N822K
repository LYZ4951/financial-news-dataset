April 16 (Reuters) - New York state prosecutors are probing more than half a dozen high-speed trading firms, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, seeking information on special relationships between exchanges and dark pools.

The New York Attorney General's office had sent out subpoenas to the firms, which include Tower Research Capital LLC, Chopper Trading LLC and Jump Trading LLC.
