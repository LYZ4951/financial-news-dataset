SEOUL, April 16 (Reuters) - Seoul shares ended flat on Wednesday as slightly better-than-expected first-quarter China growth data was somewhat offset by selling from institutions, and the won <KRW=> turned higher after local exporters sold dollars late in the session.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed unchanged at 1,992.21 points. Foreigner and retail investors supported the index, buying 43.9 billion won ($42.18 million) and 55.0 billion won worth of South Korean stocks, respectively. Institutions sold shares totalling 95.8 billion won.
