TOKYO, April 16 (Reuters) - Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co Ltd plans to slightly increase its investments in risk assets like foreign stocks and bonds this financial year as its capacity for risk-taking has risen, a company executive said on Wednesday.

The core company of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings <8725.T>, Japan's largest property and casualty insurer group, otherwise plans to stick to yen debt instruments, Hiroaki Hara, manager of investment planning at Mitsui Sumitomo, told Reuters in an interview. Japanese institutional investors collectively manage assets worth trillions of dollars and their investment plans for the financial year that began in April are closely watched by market participants.  "During the last financial year we increased risk assets, though it's in the tune of just 10 to 20 billion yen ($98 million to $197 million). We will raise them a tad this financial year as well," Hara said. Hara declined to elaborate on what risk assets the company might buy in the current financial year to March 2015. Foreign currency-denominated stocks and bonds make up the bulk of Mitsui Sumitomo's risk assets, while hedge funds and other alternative assets also account for a small amount. Hara also said Mitsui Sumitomo has no plans to radically shift money out of yen bonds, despite low bond yields at home as a result of the Bank of Japan's massive bond-buying programme. Mitsui Sumitomo wants to hold yen fixed-income assets to match its yen liabilities to avoid interest rate fluctuations, he said. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield <JP10YTN=JBTC> has been stuck around 0.6-0.7 percent in the past few months as the BOJ buys about 7 trillion yen of JGBs per month, an amount equal to about 70 percent of new debt sales by the government. "Our main scenario is that bond yields will be little changed at a time when the Bank of Japan is buying and additional easing is being talked about," he said. Mitsui Sumitomo has total assets of 5.9 trillion yen ($58 billion).
