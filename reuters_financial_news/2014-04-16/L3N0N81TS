TOKYO, April 16 (Reuters) - Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance [FKMLI.UL], Japan's eighth-largest insurer in terms of assets, plans to raise its holdings in Japanese equities for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008, a senior official said on Wednesday.

Takehiko Watabe, general manager of investment planning, told Reuters in an interview that Fukoku plans to buy domestic stocks worth 10 billion yen ($98.4 million) in the current business year through March 2015 as Bank Of Japan's massive easing has dried up domestic bond market liquidity.
