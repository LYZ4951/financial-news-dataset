MILAN, April 16 (Reuters) - The adviser of troubled Italian energy group Sorgenia will meet creditor banks on Thursday with a final deal over debt restructuring in sight, a source close to the matter said.

"The deal is within reach, there will be a meeting tomorrow," the source said on Wednesday. Sorgenia, controlled by holding company CIR <CIRX.MI> has run up 1.9 billion euros of debt - 600 million euros of which must be cleared to keep it afloat in the short term.
