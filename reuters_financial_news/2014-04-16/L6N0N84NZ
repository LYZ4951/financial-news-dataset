PARIS, April 16 (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday put forward his former chief of staff, Pierre-Rene Lemas, to head the state-owned bank Caisse des Depots (CDC), his office said.

If Lemas' nomination is confirmed in parliament, he will in effect be switching places with Jean-Pierre Jouyet, who is coming from the CDC to be Hollande's chief of staff. Lemas, 63, and Jouyet, 60, were both Hollande's class-mates at France's Ecole Nationale d'Administration civil service college.
