SEOUL, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> fell to a 5-month low on Monday, as growing anticipation of an early rate hike by the U.S Federal Reserve prompted investors to chase long-positions in the dollar.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,038.0 to the dollar at the conclusion of onshore trade on Monday, a shade firmer from a 5-month intraday low of 1,041.8 posted earlier in the day. The local currency closed Friday's session at 1,035.3. South Korean shares edged lower as risk appetites cooled following a batch of soft economic data out of China, while aggressive bets were further discouraged ahead of a key Fed policy meeting on Tuesday.
