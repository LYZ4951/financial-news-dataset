JAKARTA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Indonesia's financial regulator will encourage local insurance companies to pursue initial public offerings to have more access to capital, an official said on Monday.

"In the past, domestic owners of capital were not strong enough, but now there are many that are strong enough," Firdaus Djaelani, a commission board member of the Indonesian financial services authority, told reporters. "The commitment has to be long-term because a new life insurance business will only bring in profits after five to six years." The Indonesian government plans to issue a regulation to cut the size of the stake that foreigners can own in a local insurer to less than 80 percent, Djaelani said. The regulation will only apply to new investors, he added.

Insurance companies operating in Indonesia include PT Prudential Life Assurance (Prudential Indonesia), PT BNI Life Insurance, PT Asuransi Allianz Life Indonesia and AXA Mandiri. Indonesia's insurance sector has seen a spate of acquisitions in the past few years as foreign companies seek to capitalise on the low coverage and attractive growth rates in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
