Sept 15 (Reuters) - There is a one-in-three chance U.S. Treasury yields will trade at or below where they are now in a year despite broad expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike rates by mid-2015, according to strategists polled by Reuters.

The poll also found that major sovereign bonds will remain in favour with investors, despite record low yields, partly because there are no clear expectations for inflation to take off in any of these economies.  U.S. Treasuries have rallied since the beginning of the year, pushing 10-year yields down by 60 basis points - a totally unexpected move for most fixed-income strategists when polled at the start of the year, as most thought yields would rise.  But having been wrong-footed once, they have now tempered their views. The latest Reuters poll of more than 50 strategists suggested the U.S. 10-year note will yield 2.74 percent by the end of December, just over 10 basis points up from Friday's close of 2.61 percent. Yields are then expected to climb to 3.20 percent in a year. The Fed begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday at which it is widely expected to make changes to its policy language, tempering slightly its dovish tone as it winds down its bond purchases program. While most strategists expect the Fed to raise rates in the second quarter of next year, they gave a 30 percent chance that 10-year yields will not rise from their current rate in a year.  "There is a pretty good chance - maybe 75 percent chance - we end up below 3 percent by the time we get close to rising rates. Rates going up is more a grind higher rather than the sort of price action we had last year," said David Thielke, fixed-income strategist at Nomura. "If you look at global fixed-income in general, the European outlook is so dismal and the Russia-Ukraine problem is not solved. There are a lot of risks, so people are happy being long even when it is already so rich," Thielke added. Yields on 10-year German Bunds have dropped almost 100 basis points this year - even more than their U.S. counterparts - to 1.07 percent, due to dangerously low inflation.  Unlike the Fed and the Bank of England, the ECB is not likely to raise rates anytime soon and will only get started on asset-backed securities (ABS) purchases programme next month. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecasts for major developed economies on Monday, urging more aggressive ECB stimulus to ward off the risk of deflation in a subdued euro zone. [ID:nL6N0RG2CK] A Reuters snap poll conducted after the ECB meeting last week gave a 40 percent chance of the bank buying sovereign bonds, as the Fed and the BoE have done. [ECB/INT] Strategists see a negligible rise in German bund yields by December but forecast them rising to 1.45 percent by September next year, almost 50 basis points higher than they are now. A few forecasters said they may rise a lot more on expectations the ECB's planned ABS purchases and another round of long-term loans, this time on condition that banks lend the cash on, will be enough to push up inflation. [ECB/REFI] "The reason behind that is that at some point over the next 3-6 months we are going to see inflation and output begin to turn around," said Luca Jellinek, head of European rates strategy at CA-CIB, who forecasts the yield to jump to 2.10 over the coming year. "The main impact of that action (sovereign bonds) would have been to lower yields but they are already low - I don't think a central bank can really decide how (fast) an economy can grow. It'd be nice if it could, but it can't," Jellinek added.
