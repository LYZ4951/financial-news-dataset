HANOI, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Vietnam's top textiles and garment maker Vinatex has been given the go-ahead to sell a combined 24 percent stake to two domestic property firms, among them Vingroup <VIC.HM>, ahead of the state-run firm's IPO next week.

Vinatex will sell 10 percent to Vingroup <VIC.HM>, the country's third-biggest listed firm by market value, and 14 percent to the unlisted Vietnam Investment Development Group, Vinatex said in a statement on its website (www.vinatex.com). It is widely seen as one of the most attractive among a slew of more than 400 planned initial public offerings by firms the government is selling shares in as part of moves to clean up a largely inefficient state sector. Vinatex dominates a local textiles sector that is set to gain strongly from a raft of trade pacts Vietnam is negotiating, including the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would see it replace China as the biggest garment supplier to the United States market. It seeks to raise at least $63.4 million at the Sept. 22  IPO, offering 122 million shares, or 24.4 percent, to the public at a starting price of 11,000 dong ($0.52) each. The state will retain 51 percent and the remaining 0.6 percent will be sold to employees. [ID:nL4N0PD1MJ] It did not disclose the price of its share sales to the two potential strategic investors.  Garments and textiles are Vietnam's second-biggest cash earner after cellphones, netting $18 billion in 2013, with the figure projected to rise to $24 billion this year.
