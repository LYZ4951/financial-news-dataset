DETROIT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Syncora Guarantee Inc, one of Detroit's remaining holdout creditors, confirmed on Monday it has reached a "comprehensive settlement" with the city.

In a U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing, the bond insurance company said the deal was still subject to "definitive documentation and resolution of other terms and conditions currently under discussion."
