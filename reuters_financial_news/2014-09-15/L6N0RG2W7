LISBON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The outgoing chief executive of Portugal's' Novo Banco - the successor to Banco Espirito Santo after a recent state rescue - told clients on Monday that they can rely on the bank and that they will benefit from management changes after his resignation.

Vitor Bento said in a letter to clients the management change occurs at an opportune moment and "has nothing dramatic to it". He backed the newly-named CEO Eduardo Stock da Cunha as a renowned professional with lots of experience in the banking sector. [ID:nL6N0RF0M2]
