Sept 15 (Reuters) - Hedge funds Red Alder LLC and Engine Capital again urged Ann Inc <ANN.N> to consider a sale to a private equity firm or another apparel company, stepping up pressure on the women's retailer to improve its performance.

A sale to retailers like Chico's FAS Inc <CHS.N>, Ascena Retail Group <ASNA.O>, J.Crew or Fast Retailing Co Ltd <9983.T>, could fetch a price between $60 to $65 per share for the Ann Taylor parent, the hedge funds said in an investor presentation on Monday. A sale to a private equity firm like Golden Gate Partners, Sycamore Partners or Apax Partners, would likely take place between $50 to $55 per share, the funds said. Ann officials could not be reached for comment. Red Alder and Engine Capital, which together own more than 1 percent of Ann stock, said they have spoken to a number of shareholders and "not a single shareholder disagrees with our strong recommendation that Ann immediately conduct a strategic alternatives review. The consensus is that the status quo is not sustainable and that exploring a sale makes sense." Ann has hired investment bank JPMorgan to explore strategic alternatives including a potential sale, Reuters reported earlier. The hedge funds urged the Ann board of directors to acknowledge that they were looking at alternatives and to form a special committee headed by board member Daniel Yih. Earlier this year, private equity firm Golden Gate Capital took a 9.5 percent stake in Ann, saying the stock was undervalued. In the second quarter, Ann reported earnings of 70 cents per share, down from 76 cents in the same quarter a year earlier. The company also cut its annual sales outlook. Ann's margins have been hurt by increased in-store promotions across the retail industry, the company said on its earnings call.
