MUMBAI, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell nearly 1 percent on Monday, posting their biggest single-day decline in nearly five weeks as blue-chips declined on anxiety after China's factory output slowed and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting this week.

Shares retreated further from a record high hit last week as Asian stocks skidded to five-week lows after a batch of weak data out of China raised the spectre of a sharp slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
