MOSCOW, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Russia's Finance Ministry will create a multi-billion dollar anti-crisis fund in 2015 to aid those companies hit by sanctions, Russian news agencies cited Finance Minister Anton Siluanov as saying on Monday.

The money would be made available by blocking for a second year running transfers of funds from the federal budget into the Pension Fund and would also use a sum of money left in this year's budget.
