Sept 15 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell nearly 1 percent on Monday to mark their biggest single-day fall in nearly five weeks as blue-chips such as ITC Ltd <ITC.NS> declined on anxiety after China's factory output slowed and caution ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting this week.

ITC provisionally fell 1.2 percent, while Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS> ended 1.6 percent lower.
