MOSCOW, Sept 15 (Reuters) - London-listed Russian ports operator Global Ports <GLPRq.L> said on Monday its first-half net profit rose 30 percent year-on-year, helped by the acquisition of rival NCC in December 2013.

Net profit, attributable to equity holders, rose to $69.9 million from $53.7 million a year earlier while revenue jumped 70 percent to $286.5 million, the firm said in a statement.
