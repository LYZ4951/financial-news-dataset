SYDNEY, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen steadying on Tuesday after the benchmark posted its worst one-day loss in five weeks in the previous session. Mining stocks may climb after battered iron ore prices jumped overnight.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> were flat at 5,475, a 1.5-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark suffered its biggest loss in five weeks on Monday, slumping 1 percent.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> dipped 0.3 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks closed mixed on Monday as the tech sector dragged the Nasdaq to its worst day since July and kept the S&P 500 near the unchanged mark as investors cleared the decks for Alibaba's debut planned for later this week. * Spot iron ore posted its biggest one-day rise since March overnight as firmer spot steel prices in China spurred a rebound from recent 5-year lows, although the recovery is seen as fragile amid growing signs of weakness in the world's No.2 economy.  * Over 2,000 workers at the world's largest copper mine, Chile's Escondida which is controlled by BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX>, will strike on Sept.22 and 24. [ID:nL1N0RG2I9] * The Reserve Bank of Australia will release minutes from its September policy meeting later in the day.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2310 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1984.13 -0.07%-1.410 USD/JPY <JPY=>   107.13  -0.03%-0.030 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.5906  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1232.61 -0.01%-0.130 US CRUDE<CLc1>   92.83   -0.10%-0.090 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   17031.14 0.26% 43.63 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  151.62  -0.93% -1.42 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Nasdaq slumps to worst day since July; S&P 500 dips [.N]   * Brent little changed after dipping to 26-month low [O/R]   * Gold rises on weak Chinese factory data; Fed in focus [GOL/]   * Nickel falls on supplies, China growth jitters   [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB] DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
