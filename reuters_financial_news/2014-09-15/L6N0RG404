LJUBLJANA, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Slovenia will have to sell its telecom operator Telekom <TLSG.LJ> as a whole as promised to international investors, incoming finance minister Dusan Mramor told a parliamentary committee hearing on Monday.

He rejected suggestions from some members of the new Prime Minister Miro Cerar's centre-left bloc that Telekom should be split into infrastructure and service units before it is sold, so that infrastructure would stay in state hands. Analysts said such a move could considerably dampen investor interest.
