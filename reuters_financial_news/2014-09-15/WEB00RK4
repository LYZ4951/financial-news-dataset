ZURICH, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Swiss Re <SRENH.VX> said on Monday it expects to see a slowing decline in natural catastrophe pricing rates, and sees demand doubling in some markets by 2020.

The world's second-largest reinsurer, who helps shoulder the risks faced by primary insurers in exchange for part of the profit, said in a statement it expected demand for nat cat cover to rise roughly 50 percent in mature markets and 100 percent in high growth markets from 2012 to 2020.
