HANOI, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> ended down 0.34 percent on Monday as selling increased near the session's end while investors looked at the portfolio restructuring of two exchange-traded funds' (ETF).

Hanoi-based lender Vietcombank <VCB.HM> led the losses with a 2.46 percent fall, followed by property firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> that declined 1.8 percent. "The index is likely to fluctuate largely in high volume this week when two ETFs review their portfolios," said analyst Nguyen Hoang Phuong of Ho Chi Minh City Securities. The Market Vectors Vietnam <VNM.P> and db x-trackers FTSE Vietnam <XFVT.DE>, two major foreign ETFs that trade in Vietnamese equities, are scheduled to end their quarterly portfolio restructurings by Friday. "Many investors are waiting for the ETFs to finish their review before making any further investment," Phuong said. He recommended buying when the index corrects, similar to the Monday session, given the positive long-term outlook for the market.
