PARIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - France's largest listed bank, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, said on Monday it completed the purchase of Bank BGZ <BGZ.WA>, Poland's No.11 lender by assets, from Dutch Rabobank for 4.5 billion zlotys ($1.39 billion).

BNP Paribas should hold between 88.64 percent and 90 percent of Bank BGZ, while Rabobank will retain a stake of just a below 10 percent following the transaction, BNP said in a statement. Poland's financial watchdog KNF approved the takeover earlier this month. [ID:nL5N0R32CM]
