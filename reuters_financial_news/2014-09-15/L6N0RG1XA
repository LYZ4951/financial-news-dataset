LISBON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Portugal wants to sell Novo Banco - the successor to troubled Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> after a state rescue last month - quickly because risks grow with time, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said on Monday.

Passos Coelho spoke to reporters a day after the Bank of Portugal picked a new chief executive for Novo Banco to lead the sale process following the embarrassing resignation of its three top managers appointed only two months ago. [ID:nL6N0RF0M2] "The more time passes before the bank's sale the more risks it will face," Passos Coelho said of Novo Banco, which is now owned by the country's bank resolution fund.
