LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - European equities fell in early trading on Monday after disappointing macroeconomic data from China raised concerns about the pace of economic growth in the world's second-biggest economy.

Weekend data showed China's factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August while growth in other key sectors also cooled, increasing fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown unless Beijing takes fresh stimulus measures.
