NEW YORK/FRANKFURT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] has reached a deal to buy U.S.-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp <TRW.N> for $105.60 per share, people familiar with the matter said.

The deal is set to be announced later on Monday, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. ZF on Monday announced the sale of its steering unit to Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], a move to clear antitrust hurdles as part of a broader combination with TRW. [ID:nL6N0RG0T0] [ID:nL2N0QA0L2]
