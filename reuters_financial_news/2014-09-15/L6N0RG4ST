LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Books are covered for the sale of up to 11 million shares in German internet service provider United Internet <UTDI.DE>, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a deal worth up to 382 million euros ($494 million) at Monday's closing price.

United Internet said earlier on Monday that it would sell the new shares in a private placement, with the price and number of shares sold to be announced on Sept. 16. [ID:nWEA00FLZ]
