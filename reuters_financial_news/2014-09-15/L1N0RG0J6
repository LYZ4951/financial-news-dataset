SAO PAULO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - NII Holdings Inc <NIHD.O>, the Nextel operator struggling with $5.8 billion in debt and fierce competition in Brazil and Mexico, plans to file for bankruptcy protection in the United States as early as Monday, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation.

According to one source, who requested anonymity since the process is underway, the so-called Chapter 11 filing would allow Reston, Virginia-based NII Holdings to restructure debt with creditors. NII Holdings operates in several countries in Latin America under the Nextel brand. The company wants to turn creditors into shareholders and implement a more sustainable business model with a focus on Brazil and Mexico, its two largest markets, the source added. Chapter 11 is a form of bankruptcy that reorganizes a company's business affairs and assets for a limited period.  Calls to NII Holdings seeking comment were not immediately returned. In Brazil, NII Holdings has been losing customers and suffering a decline in average revenue per user as America Movil SAB <AMXL.MX>, Spain's Telefonica SA <TEF.MC> and TIM Participações SA <TIMP3.SA> offered better coverage for increasingly popular smartphones. NII Holdings is struggling to regain market share, even after regulators exempted it from paying interconnection fees to larger rivals. Last month, NII Holdings warned it could file for bankruptcy after reporting its ninth quarterly loss in a row. Chief Executive Officer Steve Shindler said at the time that despite efforts to improve operations, cash had fallen to levels  insufficient to support the business. The company ended the second quarter with $1 billion in cash, a net recurring loss of $629 million and a reduction of 77,000 subscribers in its client base. The company has hired investment banks UBS AG <UBSN.VX> and Rothschild to advise on a potential sale and a debt restructuring, respectively.  NII Holdings was trying to sell its Argentina unit to a group of investors led by Argentina's Grupo Ventintrés and U.S. buyout firm Optimum Advisers ahead of the bankruptcy filing, according to two sources. The same investor group had acquired Nextel Chile last month.
