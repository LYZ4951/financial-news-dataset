NEW YORK/FRANKFURT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - German car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen [ZFF.UL] has reached a deal to buy U.S.-based TRW Automotive Holdings Corp <TRW.N> for $105.60 per share in cash, creating a global automotive supply powerhouse.

The transaction values the U.S. company at nearly $12 billion based on shares outstanding, and has an enterprise value of $13.5 billion including assumption of debt, the companies announced on Monday. The merger would create one of the world's largest automotive suppliers with combined annual revenue exceeding $40 billion. ZF, a major provider of steering systems and powertrains, would get a leading maker of automotive safety products, such as brakes and air bags. The deal price represents a premium of 16 percent over TRW's closing price on July 9 before news of ZF's buyout interest first emerged. The price represents a multiple of 7.6 times TRW's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the year ended June 2014, making it one of the most expensive takeovers in the auto parts sector. ZF on Monday announced the sale of its steering unit to Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], a move to clear antitrust hurdles as part of a broader combination with TRW. [ID:nL6N0RG0T0] [ID:nL2N0QA0L2] Reuters first reported on July 30 that ZF was in advanced talks to buy TRW for around $105 per share, but wanted to have a plan to divest its steering business before finalizing the deal. [ID:nL2N0Q51PS] TRW, based in Livonia, Michigan, makes airbags, electronics, and braking and steering equipment for cars globally. It sells to nearly all major automakers, including Ford Motor Co <F.N> and General Motors Co <GM.N> The company, which had sales of $17.43 billion last year, counts Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> as its largest customer and gets about 40 percent of its revenue from Europe. Privately owned ZF Friedrichshafen, which supplies chassis components to companies including Audi AG <NSUG.DE> and BMW <BMWG.DE>, generates about half of its revenue in Europe and posted 2013 revenue of 16.84 billion euros ($21.7 billion). ZF, which already helps carmakers develop hybrid-powered drivetrains, has been on the lookout for a strategic partner after an analysis showed them that semi-autonomous driving functions and vehicle connectivity will develop into important new business areas.
