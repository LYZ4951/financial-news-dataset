WARSAW, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Warsaw-listed real-estate developer Globe Trade Centre (GTC) <GTCP.WA> plans to issue new shares - which will increase the total number by 40 percent - to help fund takeovers in Poland and eastern Europe, the company said on Monday.

Some 140 million new shares will be offered to existing shareholders, who will vote on the plan on Oct. 13. Current owners will be entitled to one new share for every share they will have on Dec. 16. Shares in GTC, 30 percent owned by private equity firm Lone Star, fell almost 9 percent on Monday, valuing the potential issue at 742 million zlotys ($228.3 million). GTC, eastern Europe's largest listed real estate developer, wants to focus on assets in Poland and the capital cities around central and southeastern Europe. It targets commercial real estate. "New assets, together with the chosen developer projects - mostly the two malls under construction in Warsaw, should allow the company to build a real-estate portfolio and raise operating cash flows," GTC said in a statement.
