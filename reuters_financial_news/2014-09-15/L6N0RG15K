PARIS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> rose 5.5 percent on Monday to top the price bid last week by Chinese conglomerate Fosun <0656.HK> on investor hopes of a bidding war for control of the French resort operator.    On Friday, Fosun offered 22 euros per share bid for Club Med, outbidding a 21 euro offer by Italian tycoon Andrea Bonomi, and valuing the French vacation group at 839 million euros ($1.1 billion).

Cub Med shares, which were suspended ahead of Friday's announcement and resumed trading on Monday, were up 5.50 percent at 22.40 euros by 0732 GMT. The stock is up 22 percent since the start of the year. "It's not crazy to think that Bonomi may counter-bid. The fight is looking increasingly personal and it's hard to imagine that Bonomi is going to call it quit at this point," said one analyst who asked to remain anonymous. A spokesman for Bonomi told Reuters on Friday that the 48-year-old Italian businessman was considering his options.
