NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to bounce at the open on Wednesday, on the heels of the biggest drop in the S&P 500 since mid-April, as earnings season winds down and ahead of congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.

* Developments in Ukraine helped sentiment, as Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he was ready to discuss a way out of the crisis with the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). [ID:nL6N0NT46Q] * Testimony from Fed Chair Yellen to the Joint Economic Committee, scheduled for 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT), will be closely monitored. While Yellen is largely expected to maintain a dovish policy stance, investors will look for clues on how soon interest rates will be raised, with many expecting hikes beginning in 2015.  * U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, closing at session lows as the S&P 500 <.SPX> suffered its biggest percentage decline since April 11. AIG <AIG.N> dragged on financial shares after disappointing earnings and a slide in Twitter <TWTR.N> hurt other names in the technology and internet space.  * Over 20 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. Whole Foods Market Inc <WFM.O> tumbled 18 percent to $39.31 in premarket trading after the organic grocer posted second-quarter results and cut its 2014 outlook on Tuesday. [ID:nL2N0NS1VH]  * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> rose 4 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <YMc1> gained 47 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> added 9.5 points. * According to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning, of 397 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings, 67.5 percent beat expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994 and 66 percent beat rate for the past four quarters.  * Profits are expected to rise 4.6 percent this quarter, down from 6.5 percent growth estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent in mid-April, according to Thomson Reuters data. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Morning Call: Ali-baby arrives; Tesla to report http://reut.rs/1iHqiTf ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> * U.S. nonfarm productivity fell at its fastest pace in a year in the first quarter due to severe weather, leading to the largest gain in unit labor costs in more than a year. Productivity fell at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the quarter, the Labor Department said. [ID:nLNS7GEAG9] * Mondelez International Inc <MDLZ.O> jumped 9.5 percent to $38.70 before the opening bell after the company posted first-quarter earnings and said it reached a deal with Dutch coffee and tea company D.E Master Blenders 1753 BV to combine coffee businesses.
