May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed China-based homebuilder Golden Wheel Tiandi Holdings Company Limited's <1232.HK> (GWTH) Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Rating at 'B' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed GWTH's senior unsecured rating at 'B', with recovery rating at 'RR4'.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Niche Positioning: GWTH's strategy remained focused on developing small-sized  commercial and residential projects linked to metro stations as seen in its  recent land acquisitions with metro and/or high-speed rail accessibility in  Changsha and Wuxi. Potential competition from large national developers for  metro-linked projects may squeeze GWTH's margin over the longer term, although  Fitch notes volume-driven developers are generally less likely to participate in  these small niche projects.   Limited Scale:  GWTH's rating is constrained by its small size relative to other  peers rated at 'B'. Its small operating scale increases its dependence on  several key projects (around three new projects) each year, which may result in  more volatile sales performance and cash flow pattern. The company's focus on  small commercial projects linked to metro stations may also curb the speed of  expansion of its business scale. Still Healthy Margins: Over the medium term, the company's EBITDA margins would  likely stay at around 30%, supported by its metro-linked integrated projects,  particularly in Nanjing. GWTH's EBITDA margins narrowed to 30% in 2013 from  43.3% in 2012 due to higher land costs and construction costs, a trend also seen  among other property developers. In 2012, profitability was also boosted by its  Golden Wheel International Plaza project, which fetched about 70% gross profit  margin.   Slower Land Acquisitions in 2014: Fitch expects net debt/adjusted inventory to  rise to around 27% in 2014 from 8% a year earlier due to higher sales as  development picks up  and the company settling its outstanding land premium of   about CNY800m. Such a leverage level is more favourable than that of similarly  rated, but larger, homebuilders. A slower sales execution and/or large-scale  land acquisition may negatively affect GWTH's leverage, though this is not  Fitch's base case scenario. Fitch expects GWTH to maintain a land acquisition  budget of around 30%-35% of the company's yearly contracted sales for the medium  term, smaller than the 150% in 2012.  Moderate Investments in Investment Property: Substantial investment in  investment property assets would weaken small developers' liquidity and leverage  because it would tie up long-term capital. Less than 10% of GWTH's gross floor  area under development (excluding its non-consolidated JV project in Yangzhou)  is earmarked for investment property purposes for the medium term. This allows  GWTH to still maintain a healthy asset turnover and liquidity position.  Small but Stable Recurring Income: The performance of its investment property  business has been stable with CNY56m of recurring EBITDA in 2013 compared with  CNY54m in 2012. The recurring EBITDA from investment property was just 21% of  overall EBITDA in 2013. The company has secured more metro-sub leasing contracts  but contribution to cash flow would still be dwarfed by the larger property  development and investment property segment. Fitch expects GWTH's recurring  EBITDA interest coverage would remain at around 0.4x for the next two years  (2013: 0.74x) as the increase in debt to support its property development  segment outpaces rental income growth.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - A significant year-on-year decrease in contracted sales plus sales after  completion -EBITDA margin falling below 25% on a sustained basis  -Net debt/ adjusted inventory rising above 30% on a sustained basis -Deviation from the current focus on metro-linked projects Positive: No positive rating action is expected over the next 12-18 months given  the company's current small scale. However, positive rating action may result  from: -Increase in the value of investment properties to over CNY5bn (2013: CNY3.7bn)  and annual contracted sales plus sales after completion to CNY3bn  (2013:  CNY984m)
