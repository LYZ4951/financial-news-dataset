COLOMBO, May 7 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks rose on Wednesday to hit a more than three- month closing high, led by shares of large cap companies traded in high volumes, while foreign inflows and a lower interest rate regime helped boost sentiment, dealers said.

The day's turnover was 1 billion rupees ($7.66 million), more than this year's daily average of 969.3 million rupees. Offshore investors were net buyers of 270.6 million rupees worth of stocks on Wednesday, but they have been net sellers worth 6.94 billion rupees so far this year. Shares in large cap Bukit Darah PLC <BUKI.CM> rose 1.47 percent to 612.8 rupees, while Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC <CTC.CM> rose 1.51 percent to 1,099.4 rupees.
