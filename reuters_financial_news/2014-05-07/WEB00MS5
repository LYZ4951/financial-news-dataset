HELSINKI, May 7 (Reuters) - Finnish insurance and investment group Sampo <SAMAS.HE> reported its quarterly result rose 7 percent due to strong profit contribution from its stake in Nordea Bank <NDA.ST>

Sampo, which owns 21 percent of the bank, said its total pretax profit for the first quarter rose to 396 million euros ($552 million), a tad short of analysts' average expectation of 403 million in a Reuters poll. The property and casualty insurance unit If's combined ratio, which measures profitability, improved to 90.3 percent from 90.9 a year earlier.
