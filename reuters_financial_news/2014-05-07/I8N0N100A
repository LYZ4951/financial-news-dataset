MUMBAI, May 7 (Reuters) - The chairman of Indian bourse operator Financial Technologies (India) Ltd <FITE.NS>, Jignesh Shah, was arrested on Wednesday, a Mumbai police spokesman said, without giving further details.

Shah has been under police investigation after National Spot Exchange Ltd, a commodities exchange owned by Financial Tech, abruptly suspended trade in most of its commodities contracts last year. [ID:nL3N0LC3JN]
