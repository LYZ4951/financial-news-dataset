May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to assign a 'BBB+' rating to the proposed Euro500 million 12-year senior unsecured notes issuance by Aon plc <AON.N> (Aon). Additionally, Fitch has affirmed all of Aon's ratings, including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior debt ratings at 'BBB+', and the commercial paper ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list  of ratings follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The new notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon Corporation (Aon  Corp.) and the ratings are therefore based on Aon Corp.'s existing Fitch 'BBB+'  IDR. The net proceeds from this new senior debt issuance will be used to  refinance Aon Services Luxembourg & Co S.C.A. senior unsecured debt of the same  amount maturing in July 2014.  Fitch views the proposed debt favorably as the new senior debt will likely be  issued at an attractive rate given current market conditions and will have a  long-dated maturity, resulting in an improved liquidity profile with reduced  near-term refinancing risk. Fitch does not expect change to pro forma financial  leverage following the debt issuance, since the proceeds will be used to  refinance existing debt.  The ratings affirmation reflects Aon's strong competitive position, balance  sheet and cash flow generation, very good financial flexibility, and financial  leverage which are all within guidelines for the rating category.  At March 31, 2014, financial leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDA was roughly  1.9x, and, debt-to-total capital, equity credit adjusted, was 35.3%,  representing improvement over historical results that included additional debt  from the Hewitt Associates (Hewitt) acquisition. Leverage is currently at levels  that Fitch views as solid for the rating category. Fitch expects both ratios to  remain stable with modest run-rate improvement going forward.  Fitch believes Aon's liquidity profile is strong with unrestricted cash and  short-term investments of roughly $786 million as of Dec. 31, 2013. Cash flow  remains significant with earnings-based EBITDA interest coverage of roughly  11.0x. The company generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations for the  full year 2013 compared to $1.4 billion in 2012. The ratings continue to reflect Aon's favorable competitive position among the  top three global brokers, with major operations in (re)insurance brokerage and  human capital consulting/outsourcing. The company continues to demonstrate its  ability to retain clients and expand new business while improving profitability.  Partially offsetting these positive factors is continued earnings pressure from  ongoing restructuring expenses through year-end 2013 when the Aon Hewitt Plan  closed, competitive insurance market conditions, and the global economic  downturn. Organic growth in the brokerage segment was on par with the peer  average in 2013. Favorably, the company reported organic revenue growth in both  the Risk Solutions and HR Solutions businesses in 2013 and through the first  three months of 2014.  Fitch believes that in the long term, Aon's acquisition of Hewitt will result in  positive business and operational synergies, with reasonable integration risk.  Aon expects cumulative annual expense savings of $402 million to be fully  realized by the end of 2014. Fitch also believes that the current management  team has a very good track record related to the execution of strategic plans  and expense cutting, and any remaining integration risk is anticipated to be  manageable. As of March 31, 2014, Aon was on track to meet its stated  expectations.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include a sustained  strong improvement in operating performance on an absolute basis and relative to  peers with operating EBIT consistently over $1 billion and an operating EBIT  margin near 15%, a run-rate debt-to-EBITDA ratio less than 1.5x, and interest  coverage as measured by an EBITDA-to-interest ratio more than 12x.  The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include a sustained  increase in the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to more than 2.25x, a deterioration of the  company's average EBITDA-to-interest expense ratio to lower single digits, and  any impairment to goodwill that would materially impact the balance sheet and  related ratios.   Fitch expects to assign the following rating: Aon plc --Euro500 million senior debt at 'BBB+'.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Aon plc --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$350 million 4.0% senior debt due 2023 at 'BBB+'; --$256 million 4.25% senior debt due 2042 at 'BBB+'; --$250 million 4.45% senior debt due 2043 at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.  Aon Corporation --IDR at 'BBB+'; --$600 million 3.5% senior debt due 2015 at 'BBB+'; --$500 million 3.125% senior debt due 2016 at 'BBB+'; --$600 million 5% senior debt due 2020 at 'BBB+'; --$521 million 8.205% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due  2027 at 'BBB-';  --$300 million 6.25% senior debt due 2040 at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.
