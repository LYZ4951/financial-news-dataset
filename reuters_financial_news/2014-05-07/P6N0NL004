PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA>, France's third-biggest listed bank, reported a 29.6 percent rise in quarterly net income on Wednesday as cost cuts took effect and as the health of its Italian consumer-loan unit improved.

Credit Agricole, which is returning to its roots as a France-focused retail bank after a painful acquisition spree abroad, said it was committed to implementing its recently unveiled medium-term strategic plan, which called for more cost cuts and a broader range of products to boost profits. [ID:nL6N0MH0YL] The bank, which is majority owned by a network of cooperative regional lenders, said first-quarter net income rose to 868 million euros ($1.21 billion) from 469 million in the year-ago period.
