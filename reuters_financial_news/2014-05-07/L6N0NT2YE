PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - Citroen brand chief Frederic Banzet will step down and be replaced by the French car brand's British operational head, Linda Jackson, PSA Peugeot Citroen <PEUP.PA> said on Wednesday.

Banzet, a member of the founding Peugeot family that is reducing its stake as part of a state-backed tie-up with China's Dongfeng Motor Group <0489.HK>, will move to a new role at the family's FFP <FFPP.PA> holding company next month. The reshuffle comes just over a month after Carlos Tavares, a former Renault <RENA.PA> executive, took over from outgoing Peugeot CEO Philippe Varin.
