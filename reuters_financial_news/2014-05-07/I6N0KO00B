MILAN, May 7 (Reuters) - Italian tyre maker Pirelli <PECI.MI> will reach its full-year targets despite a weaker than expected outlook for the Russian market, Chairman and CEO Marco Tronchetti Provera said on Wednesday.

"We expect a better environment in Europe to compensate for a slightly worse outlook in Russia and Latin America," he said during a conference call on first quarter results. The world's fifth-largest tyremaker reported a 12.6 percent increase in its quarterly operating profit.
