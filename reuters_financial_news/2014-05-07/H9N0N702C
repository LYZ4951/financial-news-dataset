BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China shares closed down on Wednesday, after a private survey showed that growth in the country's service sector slowed.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.9 percent at 2010.23 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also dropped 0.9 percent. The Markit/HSBC services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 51.4 in April from March's 51.9, showing there still is growth but the pace of it has dropped, adding to the cloudy outlook for the world's second-largest economy. An index of mainland property shares <.CSICMREI> fell 0.7 percent, marking a sixth straight day of losses.
