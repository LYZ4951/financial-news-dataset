SOFIA, May 7 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> received approval from the central bank on Wednesday to acquire the Bulgarian division of Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA>.

Corpbank, the Balkan country's fourth largest lender, has already received a regulatory approval for the deal from the competition watchdog and plans to wrap up the deal in a month. The sale, agreed in January for an undisclosed sum, would lead to a 160 million euro ($222.93 million) reduction in risk-weighted assets of Credit Agricole, the French bank has said, while lowering its solvency ratios by less than 1 basis point.
