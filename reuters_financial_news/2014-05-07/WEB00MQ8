FRANKFURT, May 7 (Reuters) - Commerzbank AG <CBKG.DE> posted a rise in profit in the first quarter as significantly improved earnings in retail banking and its Eastern European operations compensated for weaker investment banking income.     Germany's second-biggest bank posted a net profit of 200 million euros, slightly missing an analyst poll of 231 million euros. In the year-earlier period it lost 99 million euros.
