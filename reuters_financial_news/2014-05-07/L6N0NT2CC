LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Dividends will "feature prominently" in the stock market listing of ING<ING.AS>'s insurance arm, the chief financial officer of the Dutch group said on Wednesday.

"We are in the process of preparing for the IPO (initial public offering), it's fair to say that dividends will feature prominently in the IPO and equity story," Patrick Flynn told analyts on a conference call.  Earlier, ING said it had secured regulatory approval for the IPO, which is expected to happen later this year and marks the last major restructuring for ING in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
