May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Australian bank capitalisation remains secure, despite the decision by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to remove a capital benefit from debt issued by intermediate holding companies related primarily to the banks' wealth management operations, says Fitch Ratings. The rule changes will not have a major impact on large bank  capital positions. The transition arrangements run through to 2017, so the 'Big  Four' banks have the time and internal capital generation capacity to adjust to  the change.  The equity invested in intermediate holding companies has up to now been  deducted from group capital ratios, with debt issued by the subsidiaries used to  reduce this deduction. This has effectively allowed banks to create CET1 capital  through subsidiary debt issuance. The rule change applies directly to AUD2.2bn  in capital benefits for CBA, AUD2.0bn for NAB and AUD800m for ANZ. This in turn  is equivalent to 66bp of CET1 capital for CBA, 53bp for NAB and 20bp for ANZ,  based on each bank's most recent reported capital position. Westpac will be  unaffected.  We believe the impact of the recent changes to capital requirements is  manageable for all four major banks - with a relatively strong profitability and  capital base, and improved funding positions. Additional equity-raising is  unlikely to be required, as we expect internal capital generation to be  sufficient to maintain adequate CET1 ratios for their current rating level  (AA-).   The rule change follows the December APRA decision to increase the minimum CET1  ratio for domestic-systemically important (D-SIB) banks by 100bp - to 8.0% - by  2016. Together, the decisions raise capital requirements for the big banks by  1ppt-2ppt above full Basel III requirements over the next four years.
