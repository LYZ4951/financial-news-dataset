BRUSSELS, May 7 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had approved billions of euros of Irish government restructuring aid for Allied Irish Banks <ALBK.I>.

The European Commission said the aid granted by Ireland to Allied Irish Banks plc and its subsidiary EBS were in line with European Union state aid rules. European Union Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement AIB's restructuring plan "sets out the right measures for this bank to return to profitability without unduly distorting competition in the (EU's) single market."
