VIENNA, May 7 (Reuters) - Prosecutors in the Austrian city of Linz said on Wednesday they had dropped a criminal investigation into whether staff at lender BAWAG PSK [CCMLPB.UL] duped the municipal government into a 2007 swap deal, after finding no evidence of wrongdoing.

BAWAG has long defended its handling of the deal, which the Linz government is trying to unwind in a separate civil legal challenge. [ID:nL6N0MA22B] "Investigations that were conducted showed no evidence that people linked to BAWAG deliberately misled the city of Linz or contributed to any potential breach of trust," the prosecutors said in a statement. BAWAG, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management [CBS.UL], hailed the decision. "The attempt by Linz's lawyers to criminalise BAWAG PSK staff has failed," it said in a statement.
