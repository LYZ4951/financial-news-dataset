BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished down on Wednesday, as concerns about valuations of property and tech stocks hurt investor confidence after a U.S. tech sell-off.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 1.1 percent at 21,746.26. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 0.9 percent.  US tech woes spilled into Hong Kong, with the HSI information technology subindex <.HSCIIT> down 3.4 percent to its lowest level since Dec. 27 amid persisting concerns that sector valuations may be too high. Index heavyweight Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> declined 3.8 percent. The Hong Kong real estate subindex <.HNSP> dropped 1.6 percent, as investors worried about local demand for housing and exposure to the sector in the mainland.
