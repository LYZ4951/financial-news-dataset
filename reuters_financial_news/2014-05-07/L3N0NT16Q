SEOUL, May 7 (Reuters) - The won <KRW=> rose to a fresh near six-year high on Wednesday as the dollar eased on bets that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will speak in dovish tones in congressional testimony this week, further undermining the greenback.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,022.5 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.8 percent from Friday's close at 1,030.3 and the strongest since Aug. 8, 2008. South Korean financial markets were closed on Monday and Tuesday due to public holidays.
