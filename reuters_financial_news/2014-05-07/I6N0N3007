MILAN, May 7 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Popolare Emilia Romagna <EMII.MI> lost 2.6 percent in early trade, underperfoming a 1.2 percent fall in the sector's index, after announcing plans to raise up to 750 million euros with a rights issue. [ID:nL6N0NS5TI]

A Milan-based trader said the bank's first-quarter results were in line with expectations, but that the prospect of several cash calls by Italian lenders hitting the market over the next few weeks was weighing on banking shares. BPER said it hoped to carry out the rights issue by the end of July.
