* Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group <IPO-ALIB.N> filed paperwork on Tuesday in the United States to sell stock to the public for the first time. The company is expected to raise $15 billion to $20 billion, which would make it the biggest American IPO since Facebook Inc's <FB.O> $16 billion offering in May 2012. (http://r.reuters.com/ted29v)  * Yahoo Inc <YHOO.O> most likely will receive $10 billion to $15 billion for the 9 percent stake that it is required to sell in Alibaba Group. The Chinese e-commerce company's IPO will bring an end to the long honeymoon of Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer. She will have to prove to Wall Street that she has a viable plan to save Yahoo and will use the Alibaba windfall wisely. (http://r.reuters.com/rud29v)  * German drug-maker Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> said it has agreed to acquire Merck & Co Inc's <MRK.N> consumer care business for $14.2 billion, a deal that will make Bayer one of the largest providers of over-the-counter products.

(http://r.reuters.com/sud29v)  * Walt Disney Co <DIS.N> reported net income for its second quarter of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 per share, an increase of 27 percent.

(http://r.reuters.com/xud29v)  * The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has fined Morgan Stanley <MS.N> $5 million, saying that the firm did not follow proper procedures in the initial public offerings for 83 companies including Facebook Inc <FB.O> and Yelp Inc <YELP.N>. (http://r.reuters.com/byd29v)  * Two senior partners in Apollo Global Management's <APO.N>   private equity division, Stan Parker and Jordan Zaken, plan to leave the firm. They would be following Ali Rashid, another senior partner who quietly left this year. The departures of these three partners underscore the growing pains that Apollo is facing as it adjusts to life as a publicly traded company. (http://r.reuters.com/fyd29v)  * The new Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles laid out an ambitious business plan on Tuesday that relies heavily on growing sales of its Jeep sport utility vehicles.

(http://r.reuters.com/kyd29v)  * Shares of Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> went into free fall on Tuesday as early investors became eligible to sell their shares on the market for the first time.

(http://r.reuters.com/myd29v)  * General Electric Co's <GE.N> $13.5 billion bid for the power generation and transmission units of the French company Alstom poses a grave challenge for Siemens AG <SIEGn.DE>.

(http://r.reuters.com/pyd29v)  * General Motors Co <GM.N> is recalling about 56,000 Saturn Aura sedans from the 2007-8 model years because a transmission shifter cable could break, which would keep the driver from being able to shift the transmission into park.

(http://r.reuters.com/ryd29v)  * The United States trade deficit narrowed in March to $40.4 billion, down 3.6 percent from a revised February imbalance of $41.9 billion, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. The February trade gap was the biggest in five months. Exports rebounded to the second-highest level on record, led by strong gains in sales of aircraft, autos and farm goods. (http://r.reuters.com/tyd29v)  * AstraZeneca PLC <AZN.L>, the British drug maker, on Tuesday made an impassioned defense for itself as a stand-alone company, just a day after the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc <PFE.N> again pressed its case for a $106 billion takeover offer. AstraZeneca's Chief Executive Pascal Soriot called his company's pipeline of drugs in development one of the best in the industry and said the talent it had acquired and the restructuring it had undergone in the last 18 months made a strong case for remaining on its own. (http://r.reuters.com/wyd29v)  * Office Depot Inc <ODP.N> said it would close at least 400 stores because its merger with OfficeMax Inc [OFIN.UL] resulted in overlapping locations. The company had about 1,900 stores in the United States at the end of the first quarter. (http://r.reuters.com/zyd29v)
