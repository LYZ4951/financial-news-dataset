LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Artemis Investment Management said on Wednesday it had hired five North American equity staff from Threadneedle, the international investment arm of Ameriprise Financial <AMP.N>.

Artemis, an independent asset manager of 17.7 billion pounds ($30.08 billion) at end-March, also said in a statement that it planned to launch five funds during the third quarter of 2014. The hiring of fund manager William Warren and four analysts follow the announcement in January that the Threadneedle team's two senior members, Cormac Weldon and Stephen Moore, would join Artemis.
