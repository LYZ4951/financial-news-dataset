NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages climbed last week as interest rates fell, an industry group said on Wednesday.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose 5.3 percent in the week ended May 2. That's a rebound from the previous week, when applications for U.S. home mortgages fell to their lowest level since December 2000. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose 2.4 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, jumped 8.9 percent.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. mortgage data: http://link.reuters.com/guv37s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.43 percent in the week, the lowest since November 2013.
