CAIRO, May 7 (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank let the local pound currency weaken further at a dollar sale on Wednesday, while a persistent dollar shortage keeps prices on the black market high above official rates.

The bank said it sold $40 million, the entire amount offered, at a cut-off price of 7.0202 pounds, weaker than the rate of 7.005 pounds at its last sale on Monday and the eighth drop in a row <CBEO>.  Two Cairo-based forex traders said the pound had hit its weakest since the central bank started the dollar sales in December 2012. In the closely-linked interbank market <EGP=>, the dollar traded for as much as 7.0301 pounds at 1010 GMT, weaker than on Monday when it hit its weakest since July. The rates banks are allowed to trade dollars at are determined by the results of the central bank sales, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. Three years of political turmoil since the 2011 uprising against autocrat Hosni Mubarak have unnerved tourists and foreign investors, leaving Egypt's economy suffering from a persistent dollar shortage. The central bank - propped up by dollar inflows from Gulf allies - has in recent weeks allowed the pound to weaken. But it still trades markedly weaker on the black market, where it stood at 7.50 per dollar on Monday compared with 7.48 a day earlier, according to a trader. "The central bank is allowing the pound to weaken at an accelerated pace," said one Cairo-based forex trader. "It seems they have a target and they're moving faster towards it." Egypt's foreign reserves rose to $17.414 billion in March from $17.307 billion in February. They stood at around $36 billion before Mubarak was toppled.
