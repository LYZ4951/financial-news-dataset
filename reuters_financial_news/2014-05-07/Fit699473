May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

German banks are likely to issue additional Tier 1 securities (AT1) now that the tax treatment has been agreed and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> has taken the lead with its planned issuance, Fitch Ratings says. This is positive for the sector as it will allow it to replace legacy Tier 1 instruments being phased out under Basel III and potentially help it respond to the EU-wide stress test. We believe some Landesbanken are likely to tap the AT1 market to replace legacy  Tier 1 issuance and improve capitalisation. The sector has improved capital  levels, but some banks have concentrations in more vulnerable asset classes,  such as real estate, renewable energy and shipping, that are being targeted in  the ECB's comprehensive assessment. Some commercial real estate banks may also  take the opportunity to boost capital buffers against asset concentrations and  tail risk from legacy exposures to peripheral eurozone countries.  AT1 securities could be used to fill part of the capital gap under the ECB's  adverse scenario, subject to caps that depend on the trigger points, although  they cannot be used to meet a capital shortfall arising from the asset quality  review or the baseline scenario under the stress test process. The trigger on  Deutsche's first AT1 issuance is below the level the ECB would recognise to  cover any stress test shortfall, but we believe European banks may increasingly  set AT1 trigger points with the ECB's shortfall qualification criteria in mind.   We assigned Deutsche's upcoming issue of EURxxbn x% Tier 1 capital notes a  'BB+(EXP)' expected rating. The notes will have fully discretionary coupon  payments and are subject to temporary write-down if the bank breaches a 5.125%  Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio. The trigger ratio is calculated on a  "phased-in" basis under the EU capital requirement regulations.
