ATHENS, May 7 (Reuters) - The decline in sales at Greece's biggest telecoms group OTE <OTEr.AT> is expected to have slowed in the first quarter as the country's austerity-hit economy gradually stabilises, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.

Revenues are seen falling 0.8 percent year-on-year to 958.1 million euros ($1.3 billion), according to the average estimate of seven analysts. OTE sales declined at an average annual rate of 7.3 percent over 2009-13, the period of Greece's austerity-fuelled recession. The bailed-out country and its international lenders expect the economy to expand by 0.6 percent this year. OTE is 40-percent-owned and managed by Germany's Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE>. Its biggest markets are Greece and Romania, both hit by austerity policies. Net income is seen falling by 60 percent year-on-year to 66.4 million euros, the poll showed. OTE booked a one-off gain in the first quarter of 2013 after selling its unit Hellas Sat. The company's shares have gained 19 percent so far this year, outperforming a 5.3 percent increase in the Athens bourse's general index <.ATG> over the same period. The stock trades at about 16.7 times expected 2014 earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
