LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - British grocer J Sainsbury <SBRY.L> posted a 5.3 percent rise in annual profit, its slowest growth in nearly a decade, illustrating the pressure the industry is under as a battle over prices to combat the rise of the discounters hots up.

Sainsbury's, which trails market leader Tesco <TSCO.L> and is battling with Wal-Mart's <WMT.N> Asda to be Britain's No. 2 grocer, said on Wednesday it made an underlying pretax profit of 798 million pounds ($1.36 billion) in the year to March 15. That compares with analyst forecasts in a range of 750-810 million pounds, with a consensus of 782 million pounds, and 756 million pounds made in the 2012-13 year. The firm said conditions in the food retail sector are likely to remain challenging for the foreseeable future as customers continue to spend cautiously.
