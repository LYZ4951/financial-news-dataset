HANOI, May 7 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rebounded 0.88 percent at close as investors picked up blue chips which had fallen to low price levels.

"Bargain hunting was solid, with focus on blue chips, while investment in smaller stocks barely changed," said analyst Do Bao Ngoc at MB Securities. The index hit near its three-month low on Tuesday on widespread selling from retail investors. [ID:nL3N0NS1P0] Top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> jumped 6.82 percent, the biggest gain since late January this year, while food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> advanced 2.19 percent. But the absence of supportive news made it difficult to identify the market trend, Ngoc said. Volume nearly halved from the previous session to 52.4 million shares, Reuters data showed.
