COPENHAGEN, May 7 (Reuters) - Danish drug maker Lundbeck <LUN.CO> reported first-quarter earnings above forecasts on Wednesday and kept its 2014 expectations unchanged.

The company made an operating profit of 569 million Danish crowns ($106.21 million) for the quarter compared to an average forecast of 557 million in a Reuters poll and down from 1.53 billion in the same period the year before. [ID:nL6N0NR1SP] Lundbeck's sales and profits have been hit by lower sales of dementia drug Ebixa, caused by generic competition.
