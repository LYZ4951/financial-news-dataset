MUMBAI, May 7 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell nearly 1 percent on Wednesday to its lowest close in nearly one-and-a-half months after the rupee's rise to a one-month high and UBS' downgrade of Infosys <INFY.NS> coupled with an overnight drop in U.S. tech stocks induced selling across the IT sector.

Infosys provisionally slumped 3.1 percent while Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> ended 1.5 percent lower.
