COPENHAGEN, May 7 (Reuters) - With the Danish crown trading weaker than its central parity against the euro, Danske Bank sees an increased chance the country's central bank will have to intervene and raise interest rates, it said on Wednesday.

The bank intervenes in the market to keep the crown in a narrow band around its central parity of 7.46038 per euro. It changes rates when its interventions are not effective enough. Danske Bank said in a note to clients that it expected the European Central Bank to keep its current interest rates at a rate meeting on Thursday.  "In this case, the focus is set to remain on the pace of normalisation of the interest rate spread to the euro zone and thus when Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) unilaterally raises rates again," Danske Bank said. Danish interest rates have been unusually low in recent years as the country to a large extend has been seen as a safe haven by investors. The Danish central bank lifted its rates on certificates of deposit by 15 basis points to 0.05 percent on April 24, but the crown remains above the central parity.  "Hence, there is a risk that (the central bank) may need to intervene and subsequently raise interest rates again over the coming year," Danske Bank said.
