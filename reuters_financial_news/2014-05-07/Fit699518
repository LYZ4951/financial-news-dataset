May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Apulia Series, three prime Italian RMBS backed by mortgage loans granted by bancApulia, now part of the Veneto Banca banking group, and revised the Outlook on two junior tranches to Stable from Negative as follows:  Apulia Finance No. 2 S.r.l. (Apulia 2): Class A (ISIN IT0003487623) affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable Class B (ISIN IT0003487631) affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable Class C (ISIN IT0003487649) affirmed at 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable   Apulia Mortgage Finance No. 3 S.r.l. (Apulia 3): Class A (ISIN IT0003742951) affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable Class B (ISIN IT0003742969) affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable Class C (ISIN IT0003742977) affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook revised to Stable from  Negative  Apulia Finance N. 4 S.r.l (Apulia 4): Class A (ISIN IT0004127574) affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable Class B (ISIN IT0004127582) affirmed at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable Class C (ISIN IT0004127590) affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook revised to Stable from  Negative  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Asset Performance Over the past 12 months, late-stage arrears (mortgages with at least three  monthly payments overdue) remained between 0.5% (Apulia 2) and 0.9% (Apulia 3  and 4) of the current pool, while gross cumulative defaults, defined as  mortgages with at least seven monthly payments overdue, are reported at between  5.5% (Apulia 2) and 7.2% (Apulia 3) of the initial pool.  Apulia 2 is the best performer of the series, also due to the fully residential  nature of the underlying portfolio (i.e. no SME loans).  The high average seasoning, between 142 (Apulia 2) and 102 months (Apulia 4),  and the low average current loan-to-value ratio of the underlying mortgages,  spanning from 31% (Apulia 2) to 40% (Apulia 4), contribute to the stable  performance. As a result, Fitch expects that late stage arrears will remain  stable and only a limited number of mortgages will default. This also is the  reason behind today's Outlook change to Stable from Negative.  Replenishing Cash Reserves None of the cash reserves is at its target amount. However, over the last 12  months the respective reserve funds have been replenished and are now between  75% (Apulia 2) and 81% (Apulia 3) of the target balance. This is explained by  the stable performance and the available excess spread generated from the swap  agreements, especially in Apulia 3 and 4, where it is estimated to be between  0.9% and 1.4% of the current pool.   Payment Interruption Risk Mitigated Fitch tested the effects of a servicer disruption and concluded that the  available reserve funds and, in Apulia 4, the liquidity facility sufficiently  mitigate payment interruption risk on the rated notes.   Permitted Variations  Currently the underlying pools comprise between 6.1% (Apulia 4) and 6.8% (Apulia  3) of mortgages with extended maturities. To account for the potentially higher  credit risk of borrowers asking for an extension of the loan term, Fitch made  more conservative assumptions about the mortgages and found that the  transactions are resilient to the stress.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Stable asset performance and continuous replenishment of the reserve funds,  mostly in Apulia 3, could imply positive rating actions on tranches rated below  the cap of 'AA+sf' for Italian structured finance transactions.
