LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - British investment bank and stockbroker Numis Corp <NUM.L> said first-half pretax profits rose 85 percent, helped by resilient equity markets and a surge in new stock market listings in London.

Profit before tax for the six months to March 31 rose to 16.7 million pounds ($28.38 million) from 9.0 million pounds a year earlier. Revenues were up almost 60 percent at 51.5 million pounds.
