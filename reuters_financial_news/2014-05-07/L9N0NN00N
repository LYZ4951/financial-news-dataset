LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Japan's Economy Minister Akira Amari said on Wednesday the Bank of Japan plays a key role in supporting the country's recovery by trying to achieve its 2 percent inflation target.

"The central bank is independent but always collaborating with the government. Its responsibility is to achieve the 2 percent inflation target and it is using whatever tools it has to attain the target independently," he said in London. "The BOJ is playing a role in promoting the recovery." He also said the government is receiving higher corporate tax revenues than it originally anticipated.
