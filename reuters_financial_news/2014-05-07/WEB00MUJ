STOCKHOLM, May 7 (Reuters) - Swedish finance minister Anders Borg said on Wednesday he was concerned about a suggestion by the opposition Social Democrats that the country should consider introducing an unemployment goal for the central bank.

"I'm concerned. This creates uncertainty for Swedish households and Swedish companies," Borg told journalists, saying such a goal could lead to lower investments and higher unemployment.
