PRAGUE, May 7 (Reuters) - Net profit at Czech lender Komercni Banka <BKOM.PR> dipped by 2.1 percent in the first quarter to 3.08 billion crowns ($157.46 million) in line with expectations as lending was slow to pick up and risk costs rose.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected on average attributable net profit of 3.14 billion crowns for the bank, which is 60.4 percent owned by France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>.
