SAO PAULO, May 7 (Reuters) - Brazil's largest listed homebuilders are expected to post mixed first-quarter results as they work to sell off less-profitable inventory and raise cash, a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts showed on Wednesday.

While sales in the first quarter were up slightly on an annual basis, much came from existing stock, which is often discounted due to higher down payment requirements. Brazil's builders, some of which are continuing to recover from a poorly-managed period of rapid expansion, are making efforts to boost sales and generate more cash this year in order to reduce debt and pay more dividends to shareholders.  "In addition to free cash flow, which remains critical for most companies, investors should closely monitor the level of (cancellations) and inventories," wrote JP Morgan Securities analysts led by Marcelo Motta in an investor note. Cyrela Brazil Realty SA <CYRE3.SA>, the country's No. 1 homebuilder by market value, likely earned 117 million reais ($52.6 million) in the quarter, according to the average estimate of five analysts, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. Cyrela is expected to produce positive free cash flow in the quarter after spending less on land purchases, although higher expenses on an annual basis may weigh on net income. PDG Realty SA <PDGR3.SA> which posted a small, unexpected profit in the fourth quarter after four straight quarters of losses, is likely to deliver weak earnings again as it focuses on selling off less-profitable inventory. Three analysts forecast a loss of 25.7 million reais, on average, while two expect an average profit of 7.5 million reais.  MRV Engenharia SA <MRVE3.SA>, which concentrates mostly on the low-income segment, should see net income rise 44.6 percent from a year earlier, to 114 million reais, the poll found. Most analysts expect free cash flow to continue rising despite technical problems that led to a delay in payments from state-run mortgage lender Caixa Economica Federal <CEF.UL>. Analysts were split on the outlook for homebuilder Gafisa SA <GFSA3.SA>, with three analysts predicting a 33 million reais loss, on average, and two predicting a 12.5 million reais profit. Most analysts agree that the company was hurt by higher sales cancellations in its low-income Tenda unit in the quarter. PDG Realty is expected to report quarterly earnings after markets close on Thursday and Gafisa reports on Friday. Cyrela and MRV both report on May 14.
