DUBAI, May 7 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian family conglomerate Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Brothers (AHAB) said on Wednesday it had proposed a debt restructuring plan to creditors that would see them repaid a minimum of 20 cents on every dollar owed.

AHAB said in a statement that, under the proposal unveiled at a creditor meeting in Dubai, the firm would pay 10 percent of claims as an upfront payment and would target a total recovery for creditors of between 40 and 60 percent of their due cash.
