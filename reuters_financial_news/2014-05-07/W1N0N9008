WASHINGTON, May 7 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer credit recorded its largest increase in a year in March, boosted by growing demand for student loans and household borrowing to buy automobiles.

Total consumer credit increased by $17.53 billion to $3.14 trillion, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. That was the largest rise since February 2013. February's consumer credit figure was revised lower to show a $12.99 billion increase rather than the previously reported $16.49 billion advance. Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to rise by $15.75 billion in March. Revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, rebounded by $1.13 billion after falling by a revised $2.73 billion in February. The failure in March to recoup the prior month's decline suggests that households remain cautious about assuming too much debt.
