WARSAW, May 7 (Reuters) - Poland's second largest bank, Pekao <PEO.WA>, is expected to report flat net profit for the first quarter, as lower net interest income offsets the positive effect of the accelerating economy, a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday.

Poland's central bank lowered interest rates to 2.5 percent in 2013, their lowest level in history, to help revive the sluggish economy. This created pressure on banks' net interest income results. "It would be difficult to see net profit rise year on year. The net interest income may fall slightly, because the net interest margin is still low," said Jaromir Szortyka, an analyst at PKO BP brokerage. Pekao, which is controlled by Italian lender Unicredit <CRDI.MI>,  may report a net profit of 665 million zlotys ($220.62 million) in the first quarter, according to the average of forecasts given by nine banks and brokerages. The bank's net profit for the first quarter of 2013 was 665 million zlotys.
