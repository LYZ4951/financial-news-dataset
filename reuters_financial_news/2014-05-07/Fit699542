May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Additional capital buffers for the Netherland's four  systemic banks announced by the Dutch central bank last week should support the  banks' access to confidence-sensitive international capital markets, Fitch  Ratings says. The refinancing risk from Dutch banks' structural reliance on  wholesale funding is also mitigated by cautious liquidity management.  Dutch systemic banks already meet the new 1%-3% capital add-on that will be  phased in between 2016 and 2019. The range had been discussed for some time by  the central bank, although the name-specific requirements have only just been  provided. The three largest banks - Rabobank [RABN.UL], ING Bank and ABN AMRO - will be  required to hold an additional 3% common equity Tier 1 (CET1) buffer on top of  the 7% Basel III requirement. SNS Bank's [SRSNS.UL] add-on will be 1%. All four banks  already reported fully-loaded CET1 ratios at end-2013 at or above 10%. We believe the banks will maintain solid capitalisation, especially as  challenges in the domestic market appear to be easing. We revised 2014 GDP  growth to 0.7% from 0% in March. ING's 1Q14 results published today show early  signs of loan impairment charges receding and we expect similar trends at other  Dutch banks, although these are likely to stay high in the medium term.  Dutch banks' solid capitalisation helps them to maintain access to international  capital markets for funding. The additional capital buffer requirements should  enhance investor confidence because if a firm fails to meet the buffers, it will  face restrictions on the amount of profits it can distribute through, for  example, dividend payments or coupons on Basel III compliant securities. Wholesale funding-reliance varies, with loans-to-deposits ratios at systemic  banks ranging from 108% to 138% at end-2013. The funding gap arises from  households investing their savings in pension and insurance products, and a  large mortgage loan market prompted by tax incentives, which started reducing  last year. Dutch banks rely on international investors to plug the funding gap because  domestic pension funds diversify their euro-denominated investments, rather than  concentrating them in Dutch assets. This makes the refinancing risks higher than  in countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where banks reliant on wholesale  funding benefit from a captive domestic investor base. The risks are also offset by Dutch banks generally maintaining good access to  funding markets and holding large liquidity portfolios. The four banks had Basel  III liquidity coverage ratios above 100% at end-2013.
