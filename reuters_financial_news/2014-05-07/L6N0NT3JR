KAMPALA, May 7 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> was little changed on Wednesday, as corporate demand for dollars eased while treasury bill yields declined, threatening to weaken the need for shillings among offshore investors.

At 1100 GMT, the currency was quoted at 2,516/2,526, fractionally weaker than Tuesday's close of 2,515/2,525.  "Demand from the energy and manufacturing corporates that we saw in recent days has dried up," said Manohar Miryala, head of treasury at Crane Bank. Traders said most companies had started reserving some of their local-currency holdings for mid-month tax payments, which typically depresses demand for the greenback. The local currency is up about 0.4 percent in the year, underpinned by frequent excess liquidity mop-ups by the central bank and inflows from offshore investors buying Ugandan paper.  Bank of Uganda is due to sell 120 billion shillings ($47.68 million) worth of Treasury bills of all maturities on May 14. Traders will be looking to see whether yields will drop again. At the last auction, on April 30, rates declined across all tenors, raising concerns offshore appetite for Ugandan debt was waning. Traders said that risked weakening the currency. "A further drop in yields could worsen worries about offshore flows," said Daniel Muganza, trader at Centenary Bank.
