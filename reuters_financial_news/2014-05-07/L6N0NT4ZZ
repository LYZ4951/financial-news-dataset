DUBLIN, May 7 (Reuters) - The head of the Irish government's finance department who was one of the main architects of Ireland's exit from an international bailout last year, resigned on Wednesday, the government said.

John Moran, a banking specialist, became the first person with private sector experience to become secretary general of the finance department when appointed two years ago, having previously headed its banking unit. No reason was given for his resignation in the government statement. In an email sent to staff in the department, Moran said he had taken the job for a fixed purpose and that it was never a long-term venture, a source who had seen the email told Reuters. "It was with great regret that today I accepted a letter of resignation from John Moran," Finance Minister Michael Noonan said.
