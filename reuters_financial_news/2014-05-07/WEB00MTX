VIENNA, May 7 (Reuters) - Rebel investor Alexander Proschofsky failed in a bid to join the administrative board of Austrian property firm Conwert <CONW.VI> on Wednesday.

In a close election that went to a second vote, Proschofsky won fewer shareholder votes than the company's preferred candidate, venture capitalist Martina Postl, Conwert said.
