LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - HSBC's <HSBA.L> first quarter profits fell 20 percent from a year ago to $6.8 billion as revenue dipped at its investment bank, while last year's earnings were swelled by asset sales.

HSBC, which is Europe's biggest bank but made two thirds of its profit last year in Asia, said it had continued to experience "muted customer activity" in April.
