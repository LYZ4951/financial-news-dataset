HANOI, May 7 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.69 percent at the break on Wednesday in thin trade as investors cautiously picked up shares following recent declines.

"Long-term investors saw an opportunity to collect equities that were previously too high to purchase, but only at a low volume as they expected the index would further fall," said analyst Nguyen The Minh at Viet Capital Securities. Top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> was among the top gainers. Its shares climbed 4.45 percent to 32,500 vietnam dong ($1.54) each after closing on Tuesday at the lowest level since Dec. 2012, Reuters data showed. Dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> also edged up 1.5 percent and food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> rose 2.19 percent.  Trading volume reached 26.8 million shares, well below the five-day average of 62 million, Reuters data showed.  On Tuesday the index fell to a near three-month low on widespread selling by retail investors. [ID:nL3N0NS1P0] Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).
