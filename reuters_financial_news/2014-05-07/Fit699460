May 7 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Japan-based Honda Motor Co., Ltd's <7267.T> (Honda) Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and senior unsecured debt rating at 'A'. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the company's Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs at 'F1'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Business Profile: Honda's ratings reflect its leading market shares in  key markets, a competitive product line-up, competitiveness in hybrid vehicles,  and a diversified business portfolio including the world's largest motorcycle  business by unit sales.  Benign Operating Environment: Fitch expects global auto sales and production to  rise in the low- to mid-single-digit range in 2014, driven by continued growth  in the US and China. In Japan, we expect the rise in consumption tax in April  2014 to contribute to a contraction in overall vehicle demand in 2014. Chinese  sales for Honda and the other major Japanese automakers are recovering well  following political tensions between the two countries in September 2012.  We  expect Honda to post modest auto sales volume growth in the financial year  ending March 2015 (FY15).  Profitability to be Steady: Honda's operations continued to improve in FY14 with  solid contributions from the automobile and motorcycle divisions. Industrial  operating profit (automotive, motorcycle and power products) increased to  JPY568bn from JPY387bn in FY13, while EBIT margins improved to 5.1% from 4.1%.  Honda's profitability was materially boosted by a weaker yen, which depreciated  by around 20% against the US dollar during FY14. Fitch expects operating margins  to remain steady, at or above 4% in FY15 and FY16, due to Honda's enhanced  product portfolio, modest sales volume growth and cost control. Nevertheless,  sluggish volume growth in key markets such as the US and China, an inability to  realise sufficient cost reductions against continued high selling, general and  administrative costs and R&D costs, and larger than anticipated negative FX  effects, could temper profitability.  FX Effect: Fitch expects the positive effects on profitability of a weaker yen  against the US dollar to diminish for all the Japanese automakers for the rest  of 2014, as it does not anticipate further depreciation in the yen. Honda's  management has guided for a negative FX effect on group operating profit in FY15  due mainly to currency fluctuations in emerging markets, which Fitch has  factored into its forecasts. Over the medium term, Honda's effort to increase  its overseas production capacity will reduce its overall FX exposure.  Stable, Strong Financial Profile: Fitch expects Honda's capex to remain elevated  in FY15-FY16 due to investments to expand global production capacity, update its  powertrains and enhance its product offerings. Nevertheless we expect free cash  flow to be zero, or modestly positive for the industrial business in FY15 and  FY16. We expect Honda's financial profile to remain stable, with FFO adjusted  leverage below 1.0x (FY14: 0.8x) and CFO adjusted debt above 90% (FY14: 119%). Robust Liquidity: Honda continues to maintain a solid net cash position, backed  by ample liquidity. At end-FY14, Honda's industrial business had net cash of  JPY584bn (FY13: JPY640bn). While almost 70% of total debt (which consists  primarily of domestic Japanese bank loans) was short term, it was more than  covered by cash and cash equivalents of JPY1,149bn (FY13: JPY1,180bn).RATING SENSITIVITIES:  Negative: Future developments that may collectively or individually lead to  negative rating actions include: - Market share erosion in key markets  - Substantial deterioration in global auto demand leading to significant decline  in operating profit - Sustained negative FCF - Industrial FFO adjusted leverage above 1.0x on a sustained basis
