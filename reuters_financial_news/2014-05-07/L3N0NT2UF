May 7 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL * Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper rejects the notion that he has shown disrespect to Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, and refuses to withdraw, clarify or apologize for his assertion that she acted improperly. The Prime Minister's Office said last week that Chief Justice McLachlin sought to involve him in an inappropriate conversation about a case that eventually came before the Supreme Court.

The move is a testament to a growing belief in the industry that, with an exploding array of TV options for viewers, large audiences can only be earned by live events such as professional sports.

Canada's Natural Resources minister Greg Rickford was out advertising the country's formidable crude oil and natural gas resources to energy ministers of Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the UK and United States in Rome on Tuesday.

Moreover, although recent construction will resolve the over-crowding in the short term, Correctional Service Canada has failed to develop expansion plans to properly take into account the growing number of inmates, according to a report released on Tuesday by Auditor General Michael Ferguson.

Results released by the Toronto Real Estate Board for April sales show increased pressure on the single family portion of the resale housing market, pushing prices in the old city of Toronto close to $1 million for a detached piece of property.
