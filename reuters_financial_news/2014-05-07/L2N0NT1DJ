NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - A lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department and several states against American Express Co<AXP.N> over the credit card company's rules can move forward to trial, a U.S. judge ruled on Wednesday.

The lawsuit, filed in 2010, charged that American Express' rules prevent merchants from offering discounts and incentives to consumers to use less expensive forms of payment.
