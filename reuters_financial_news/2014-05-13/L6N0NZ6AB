BUENOS AIRES, May 13 (Reuters) - The official exchange rate of Argentina's peso against the U.S. dollar weakened slightly over the past two days after holding steady since January's sharp devaluation, in a sign the central bank is allowing the peso to inch downward.

The official peso <ARS=RASL> closed on Tuesday at 8.0225 to the U.S. dollar in the local interbank market, after trading at around 8.0 since the roughly 20 percent devaluation in January.
