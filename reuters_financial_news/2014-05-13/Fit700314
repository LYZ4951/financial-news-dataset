May 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Nqaba Finance 1 (RF) Limited's [NQBFNA.UL] (Nqaba Finance 1) additional floating-rate notes (FRN) National Long-term  expected ratings, as follows:  ZAR318m Class A18 FRN: 'AAA(zaf)(EXP)'; Outlook Stable ZAR32m Class B16 FRN: 'AA(zaf)(EXP)'; Outlook Stable ZAR32m Class C16 FRN: 'A+(zaf)(EXP)'; Outlook Stable The final ratings are contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received. Fitch expects to affirm Nqaba Finance 1's existing  tranches of when final ratings are assigned. The new notes will be issued to refinance the existing class A12, B11 and C11  notes, which have a scheduled maturity of 22 May 2014. All other existing notes  will remain after the refinance date of 22 May 2014. Credit enhancement is provided by overcollateralisation and totals 26.00% for  the class A notes, 21.33% for the class B notes, 17.90% for the class C notes  and 14.87% for the class D notes. In addition, the transaction features  significant overcollateralisation of interest, resulting from the junior  position of the interest payable under the subordinated loan in the priority of  payments.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Asset Performance The transaction is a refinancing of a portion of a securitisation of residential  mortgage loans advanced by Eskom Finance Company SOC Limited (EFC, unrated) to  employees of Eskom Holdings SOC Limited (Eskom, AAA(zaf)/Stable/F1+(zaf)) and  its subsidiaries. The historical performance of these assets is strong relative  to the rest of the South African mortgage market, with 90 days delinquency rates  of 0.7% as of February 2013. This strong performance is due to borrowers' stable  employment background and the collection of mortgage payments through payroll  deduction. As of February 2014, 93.9% of loans in the cut-off portfolio are to  employees of Eskom and subsidiaries and serviced by payroll deduction.  Revolving Period The transaction features "evergreen" revolving, as the purchase of new loans is  allowed until the breach of certain performance triggers. It is also subject to  certain covenants on the portfolio features. In addition, many borrowers also  have the ability to further draw their loans. Fitch has accounted for the  potentially detrimental impact of these features on the portfolio's credit  quality.  Eskom Dependency The transaction's performance is strongly dependent on that of Eskom as (i) the  majority of borrowers are employed by Eskom and pay the instalments by salary  deduction; (ii) Eskom provides support to borrowers in the form of subsidies;  and (iii) as there is some operational dependency on Eskom and its subsidiary  EFC.  This dependency does currently not impact Nqaba's notes' ratings given Eskom's  'AAA(zaf)' rating and the nature and status of its business. As it is a  monopolistic state-owned utility provider, Fitch believes that the company is  likely to continue operating even under severe stress.   Overcollateralisation of Interest The interest due on the subordinated loan, which funds part of the mortgage  portfolio purchase price, is paid junior to the principal note allocations. This  provides significant net income after note interest payment, which supports the  senior notes credit.  Planned Sale of EFC The South African government has requested the sale of EFC but the process has  been unsuccessfully ongoing for several years. However, based on the letter of  undertaking provided by Eskom, the company is committed to maintaining payroll  deductions and subsidy payments to the borrowers after a sale of EFC. Moreover,  monthly payments are made by Eskom from payroll deductions and deposited  directly into the SPVs accounts. However, ABSA has the right to terminate the back-up servicing agreement in case  of a sale of EFC. This could further increase the transaction's operational  reliance on EFC to perform as servicer. Depending on the evolution of EFC's  business and credit profile in the longer term, this could adversely affect the  ratings of the notes.
