FRANKFURT, May 13 (Reuters) - Germany's nationalised bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) on Tuesday said a steering committee had recommended winding down its Depfa Bank unit, overruling HRE management's recommendation to instead pursue a sale to an outside investor.

On Tuesday the inter-ministerial steering committee said Depfa's assets would be transferred to FMW Wertmanagement, a government-owned investment vehicle, in the hope that gains from asset sales would benefit the taxpayer. Its task would be "to reach the best possible wind-down result for the German taxpayer", said Christopher Pleister, chairman of the steering committee. HRE's board had recommended a sale of Depfa to investor group Leucadia and its partner Massachusetts Mutual [MMLIC.UL]. [ID:nL6N0NZ1RO]
