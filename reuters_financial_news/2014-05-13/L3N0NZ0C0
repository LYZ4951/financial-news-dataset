MANILA, May 13 (Reuters) - Philippine property developer Ayala Land Inc <ALI.PS> said it has partnered with Bloomberry Resorts Corp <BLOOM.PS> to operate a mall at Bloomberry's $1.2 billion Solaire complex, Manila's newest gaming hub, to be opened later this year.

Ayala Land, a unit of Philippine conglomerate Ayala Corp <AC.PS> and one of the country's top property firms, said in a statement on Tuesday it has signed a deal with Bloomberry unit Sureste Properties Inc. "The retail component will have premium brands to complete the offering of Solaire Resort & Casino," Ayala Land said, without disclosing financial terms of the deal. Ayala said it would lease and market an area of more than 5,000 square meters at the Solaire Resort & Casino, to be opened at Entertainment City along Manila Bay. Solaire's first phase opened in March last year and expansion is under way. [ID:nL3N0L31NU] The project from Bloomberry, owned by the Philippines' fourth-richest person, Enrique Razon, is the first of four planned integrated resorts expected to rise at Entertainment City, a massive development designed to give wealthy Asian gamblers an alternative to the Chinese casino city of Macau.  Bloomberry initially estimated Solaire to cost $1 billion but later said it expected its investments in the project to reach $1.2 billion.
