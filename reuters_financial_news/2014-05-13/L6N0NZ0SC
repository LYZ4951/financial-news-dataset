OSLO, May 13 (Reuters) - The sales of new Norwegian homes remained weak in April and have fallen by 23 percent for the first four months of the year compared to the same period of 2013, a survey from the Norwegian Home Builders' Association showed on Tuesday.

Sales were also far below those of 2011 and 2012, but one percent higher than in 2010, when the economy was still recovering from the financial crisis of the previous years. Meanwhile, housing starts for the same period fell by a less dramatic 13 percent, reflecting optimism among builders that the market for new homes will rebound, according to the survey. Prices of used homes have recently picked up sharply, contributing to a positive outlook, the builders said. [ID:nL6N0NS2NC]
