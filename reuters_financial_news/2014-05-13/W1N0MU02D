WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - The regulator of Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> on Tuesday laid out new policies that could make it easier for many Americans to obtain mortgages, in part by holding off on any reduction in the size of mortgages the two firms can buy.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt, in his first public speech since taking office in early January, also said the two government-controlled firms would ease standards that govern when banks must buy back faulty loans from the two mortgage giants, which could also help loosen the credit taps.
