MILAN, May 13 (Reuters) - Unlisted Italian bank Veneto Banca said on Tuesday it would issue shares in a planned capital increase for up to 490 million euros ($671.6 million) at 36 euros each.

The bank said in a statement the shares were priced at an 8.86 percent discount to the 39.5 euros that shareholders had set in April.  Each year the bank's board recommends a per share value to shareholders, based on a number of factors including past and expected profitability. [ID:nL6N0N049W] Veneto Banca is one of 15 Italian lenders under review by the European Central Bank in a check-up of banking assets across the euro zone this year.  The bank is set to convert a 350 million euro bond into equity to bring its highest-quality Common Equity Tier 1 capital above a minimum threshold set by the ECB in the review.
