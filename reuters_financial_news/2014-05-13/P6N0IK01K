PARIS, May 13 (Reuters) - Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, France's second-largest bank, said on Tuesday it is aiming for 3 percent annual revenue growth over the next three years, helped by retail banking in Eastern Europe, Russia and Africa.

SocGen confirmed its ambitions in Russia after it took a hit from a slide in the value of assets there following unrest in Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. Societe Generale plans to finalise a 1.45 billion euro ($2 billion) cost-cutting programme in 2015 and cap expenses growth at 1 percent a year in a bid to improve profitability in an environment of slow growth in Western Europe.
