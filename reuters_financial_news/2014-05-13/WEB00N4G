MUNICH, May 13 (Reuters) - Hypovereinsbank, the German unit of Italian lender Unicredit <CRDI.MI>, is considering a sale of its online broker DAB <DRNG.DE>, Chief Executive Theodor Weimer said on Tuesday.

No decision regarding a potential divestment of the unit has yet been made, Weimer said. He added that a revamp of Hypovereinsbank's retail business had led to DAB losing importance within the group and now being regarded as non-strategic.  Last month, UniCredit CEO Federico Ghizzoni had said that DAB was an important asset for the group, though this could change in the future. [ID:nI6N0MW000] HVB has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options for DAB, sources familiar with the matter have said.
