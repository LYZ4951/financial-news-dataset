CAIRO, May 13 (Reuters) - Egypt's Citadel Capital <CCAP.CA> said on Tuesday it has  received an offer for its 73.3 percent stake in glass manufacturer Sphinx Glass for $112 million and expects a deal to be completed within two months.

The investment company said it expected the proposed sale will generate post-tax cash proceeds of $73 million but declined to name the prospective buyer. It added that a due diligence assessment of the business has already been conducted. Citadel, which has $9.5 billion under management, plans to shed holdings outside of the energy, transport, agrifoods, mining and cement sectors over the next few years and convert itself from a private equity firm into a holding company.
