SAN FRANCISCO, May 13 (Reuters) - Multi-stage venture investing firm Norwest Venture Partners said on Tuesday it had closed a $1.2 billion fund, the firm's 12th.

The newest fund brings the Palo Alto, California-based group's total capital raised to $5 billion, Norwest said. The firm's last fund, the $1.2 billion Norwest Venture Partners XI, closed in late 2009.   Several Norwest companies held initial public offerings last year, including online-security business FireEye <FEYE.O> and digital-coupon company RetailMeNot <SALE.O>. Its current portfolio companies include online retailer Gilt Group and online lender Lending Club.
