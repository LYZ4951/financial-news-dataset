May 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded Credito Fondiario S.p.A.'s  Italian Residential and Commercial Primary Servicer Ratings to 'RPS3+' and  'CPS3+' from 'RPS2-' and 'CPS2-', respectively, and removed them from Rating  Watch Negative (RWN). In October 2013, Morgan Stanley <MS.N> (MS, A/Stable/F1+) sold 100% of Credito  Fondiario's  share capital to three entities (Tages Holding S.p.A. - 85%;  Harvest Investment Partners B.V. - 6.75%; Harvip Investimenti S.p.A. - 8.25%).  Although an operational restructure was announced in January 2014, the full  impact of the sale on the company's strategy, operational performance and future  infrastructure investment has yet to be determined.  As a standalone entity, Credito Fondiario has consistently made losses over the  past seven years, and has been reliant on capital injections into the business  from MS. The new owners do not have a credit rating nor do they benefit from the  support of a rated parent, whilst their ongoing financial support for Credito  Fondiario, and the size of that support, has yet to be demonstrated. The change in ownership has led to the employment of a new senior management  group, with just one senior team member remaining in place from the time of MS  ownership. Industry experience among the senior team remains high, averaging  over 20 years, but company tenure is, as would be expected, low compared with  peers. In January 2014, 90 people were made redundant from Credito Fondiario, from a  staff of 145. The vast majority of redundancies were from the origination and  support functions. While the operational structure is now more streamlined, in  Fitch's opinion, with a reduced layer of management and a less experienced  workforce, key man risk is greater and operational performance has yet to be  tested with this new structure. Since the ownership change, Credito Fondiario has appointed a new internal  auditor. This individual is an experienced industry professional, having worked  at Credito Fondiario as Head of loan administration and customer relationships,  but does not have direct audit experience. Credito Fondiario previously utilised  the MS internal audit function for additional support and resource when  required. The operational restructure has seen the IT department reduce to 6 people from  14 and whilst this reflects the needs of a smaller business overall, the  day-to-day impact is yet to be tested. MS continued to invest in IT up to the  sale, but while there is uncertainty as to future investment in infrastructure  from the new owners, the servicer is now working on a project to upgrade the IT  platform.
