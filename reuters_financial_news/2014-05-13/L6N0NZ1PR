LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, with a key regional index making fresh six-year highs, as a rally in U.S. shares and upbeat updates from blue-chips such as steelmaker ThyssenKrupp supported risk appetite.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index was up 0.2 percent at 1,367.60 points, its highest level since May 2008. Britain's FTSE <.FTSE> was up 0.2 percent after briefly hitting its highest point in roughly a year. Shares in Germany's ThyssenKrupp <TKAG.DE> rose 4 percent as the firm raised its full-year earnings outlook. Airbus Group <AIR.PA> added 4.3 percent as the Aerospace group posted a narrower-than-expected drop in core earnings and reaffirmed its financial goals for the year. [ID:nWEB00N33] [ID:nL6N0NZ0ZO] The Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday and the Nasdaq rallied as shares of Internet and biotech companies advanced.
