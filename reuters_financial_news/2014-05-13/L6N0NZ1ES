COPENHAGEN, May 13 (Reuters) - ATP Real Estate, a unit of Danish pension fund ATP, has bought a 90 percent stake in the company owning Brussels' North Galaxy office building for 428 million euros.

"The investment is the single largest direct real estate investment by ATP Real Estate outside Denmark, and the largest international single real estate investment by any Danish institutional investor," ATP said in a statement. AXA Belgium has purchased the remaining 10 percent of the shares in the company. The seller is Cofinimmo SA.  The property is fully let to the Belgian finance ministry on very long leases, which will secure a stable cash flow for many years, ATP said.
