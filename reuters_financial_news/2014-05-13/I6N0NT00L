ROME, May 13 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Italy's top lender Unicredit <CRDI.MI> said on Tuesday it was hard to say how talks between Alitalia and Gulf-based airline Etihad would conclude.

"The discussions are still under way, it's difficult to say how they will end," Federico Ghizzoni, whose bank is one of Alitalia's main creditors, told a shareholder meeting in Rome. "We need to see whether with a serious industrial plan, like the one by Etihad, it will be possible to revamp Alitalia." Alitalia and its creditors are looking to finalise a proposal aimed at persuading Etihad to invest in the loss-making Italian carrier.
