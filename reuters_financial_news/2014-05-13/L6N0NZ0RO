DUBAI, May 13 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi investment company Waha Capital <WAHA.AD> posted a 78-percent jump in first-quarter profit on Tuesday as the sale of its stake in AerLift Leasing boosted the firm's income.

Waha Capital's net profit in the three months to end-March rose to 152 million dirhams ($41.4 million) from 85 million dirhams a year earlier, it said in a statement. Last month, Waha Capital said it had sold its 60.7 percent stake in AerLift Leasing, which owns a portfolio of 11 commercial aircraft operated by a number of international airlines, to a U.S.-based investor.
