DUBAI, May 13 (Reuters) - Investment Corporation of Dubai (ICD), the state-owned fund which holds stakes in some of the emirate's top companies, plans to sell a dual-tranche bond and sukuk offering as early as Wednesday, a document from lead arrangers said.

The fund aims to issue an Islamic bond with a six year lifespan and a conventional bond offering of 10 years duration, the document said. The dollar-denominated transaction will be benchmark-sized, although the document didn't specify if this was meant for each tranche or both of them combined. Benchmark size is traditionally understood to mean in excess of $500 million.
