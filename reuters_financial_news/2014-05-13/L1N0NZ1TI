WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - Congress is likely to agree on cybersecurity legislation this summer, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Tuesday, citing growing consensus among lawmakers on the need to help industry share data with government about attacks on computer networks.

Johnson told the Reuters Cybersecurity Summit he sees a real bipartisan desire to pass a bill after years of unsuccessful attempts.  The legislation could include some limited, targeted form of limitation on civil liability to protect companies that share information about cyber breaches, he said. Johnson, 56, said tightening cybersecurity standards was "a good government, good business" practice that should not be a "political hot potato," even for a divided Congress.  "My sense is that Congress realizes this is an area where we can legislate and we ought to try," said Johnson, who took up the post in late December, replacing Janet Napolitano. The issue, he added, does not carry the religious or moral component of overturning the "don't ask, don't tell" policy that for 17 years applied to gays and lesbians serving in the military. Johnson helped to repeal that policy in 2011 while he was the Defense Department's general counsel. Several members of Congress from both parties would "really like to get something done" on cybersecurity, Johnson said, and his hope is that it can get done this summer. U.S. lawmakers have been considering legislation to provide clarity about how private companies should be required to disclose security breaches and cyber threats.  But spats over liability and privacy protections have repeatedly thwarted comprehensive cybersecurity bills.  The House in 2013 passed for a second time a bill designed to help companies and the government share information on cyber threats.  That bill fizzled in the Senate. It also did not address industry standards and the Obama administration had threatened a veto because of privacy concerns. Meanwhile, many Democrats sought a broader bill.  Efforts at advancing legislation got a second wind in Congress last month as leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee drafted their own bill, now circulating among key stakeholders in hopes of avoiding disagreements that have thwarted passage in the past.

Privacy advocates have opposed giving companies liability protections, worried about abuses of consumer data. Besides the limited liability, Johnson said key components of any legislation would be updating the Federal Information Security Management Act; clarity on the authority that DHS has over government web operations; and clarity on what commercial firms should share with the government.
