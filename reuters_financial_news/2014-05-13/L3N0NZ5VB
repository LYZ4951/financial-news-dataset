May 13 (Reuters) - Fortress Investment Group LLC <FIG.N> is considering making a $4.7 billion bid for Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, a Manhattan apartment complex, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The New York-based private-equity firm is seeking financing for the bid and a deal would involve bringing in equity partners to contribute cash, the person said. (http://r.reuters.com/nun39v) CWCapital Asset Management LLC, a special servicer representing bondholders, took control of the complex in 2010 after its owners missed a debt payment.  MetLife sold the complex in 2007 for a record $5.4 billion to a group led by Tishman Speyer Properties LP and a real estate unit of BlackRock Inc <BLK.N>. Barclays Plc estimated in a May 2 report that the property could fetch $4 billion to $4.3 billion in a sale, which would result in zero losses to bondholders, the Bloomberg report said.
