BEIJING, May 13 (Reuters) - China's central bank has asked banks to improve efficiency in mortgage approval processes while it will strengthen supervision of mortgage risks, underlining its efforts to support the flagging property market as the economy cools.

The announcement on Tuesday confirmed a Reuters story earlier in the day that the central bank has asked commercial banks to speed up the granting of home loans and to set mortgage rates at reasonable levels.[ID:nL3N0NZ1PJ]
