May 13 (Reuters) - Shares in the Philippines and Indonesia rose to their highest in 11 months on Tuesday, following other Asian markets as investors shrugged off tensions in Ukraine, while half of the southeast Asian markets were closed for a holiday.

The Philippine index <.PSI> was up 0.7 percent by 0556 GMT to hit its highest since June 11, while the Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> climbed to its highest since June 7. Asian shares rose on Tuesday as tensions in Ukraine were eclipsed by a strong night on Wall Street. [MKTS/GLOB] Shares in Bloomberry Resorts Corp <BLOOM.PS> gained 2.6 percent after Philippine property developer Ayala Land Inc <ALI.PS> said it had partnered with Bloomberry to operate a mall at the latter's $1.2 billion Solaire complex, Manila's newest gaming hub, to be opened later this year. [ID:nL3N0NZ0C0] Globe Telecom Inc <GLO.PS>, the Philippines' second biggest telecommunications firm, was up 1.1 percent after its net profit more than quadrupled in the March quarter.

Stock markets in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore were closed for holidays on Tuesday.
