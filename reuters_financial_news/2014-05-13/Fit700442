May 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sunrise S.r.l. - Series 2012 notes, as follows: EUR3.21bn Class A notes: affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable The transaction is a EUR5bn consumer loan portfolio originated by Agos Ducato  SpA (Agos, BBB+/Stable/F2), which includes fixed-rate consumer loans receivables  granted to residents in Italy. The originator is part of Credit Agricole  Consumer Finance SA (A/Stable/F1) which currently holds 61% of Agos's shares,  while the remaining 39% is held by Banco Popolare Soc.Coop <BAPO.MI> (BBB/Negative/F3). The affirmation reflects the available credit enhancement, which has increased  since closing in July 2012 despite the transaction being in a revolving period  and weaker-than-expected portfolio performance.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Adequate Credit Enhancement Although the transaction is still in its revolving period, credit enhancement  (CE) has increased to 40.5% from 36.3% since closing. This was due to  over-collateralisation (in the form of a EUR134.9m portfolio) provided by the  originator with the transfer of new receivables following the downgrade of the  servicer below 'A', in accordance with the transaction documentation. In  addition, CE is provided by a cash reserve top-up from 0.5% to its  non-amortising target of 3% of the initial portfolio balance, through an excess  spread trapping mechanism in the first payment dates.   Performance Weaker than Expectations  As of end-January 2014, the 30 days plus delinquencies were at 3.8% of the  non-defaulted collateral balance, up from 3.2% in May 2013, while the cumulative  defaults accounted for 1.7% (all "cleared" using available excess spread), above  Fitch's expectation at closing. Given this portfolio underperformance, Fitch has  revised its lifetime base case default rate to 9% from 7.3%.  Revolving Period Almost Over The transaction is still in the revolving phase, which subject to triggers would  be expected to continue until July 2014. Despite the revolving period the  portfolio has not substantially changed and the current composition is in line  with that at closing and still below the concentration limits. Fitch expects  this trend to continue through to the conclusion of the revolving period.   Commingling Risk Mitigated According to the transaction's documentation, upon the downgrade of the servicer  Agos (to BBB+/F2 from A-/F1), the originator has transferred additional  receivables to the issuer which financed the purchase through the issuance of a  class of super-junior notes subscribed by Agos. Therefore, albeit with some  delay to the timing envisaged by the legal documentation, the originator has  addressed commingling risk.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The transaction may be subject to a rating review if there is a sudden portfolio  deterioration, where the volume of delinquent, defaults or recoveries  substantially deviate from Fitch's initial base case.  Rating sensitivity to increased default rates (class A) Current rating: 'AA+sf'  Increase base case by 10%: 'AAsf'  Increase base case by 25%: 'A+sf  Rating sensitivity to reduced recovery rates (class A) Current rating: 'AA+sf' Reduce base case by 10%: 'AAsf' Reduce base case by 25%: 'AAsf' Rating sensitivity to increased default rate and reduced recovery rate (class A) Current rating: 'AA+sf'  Increase default base case by 10%; reduce recovery base case by 10%: 'AA-sf'
