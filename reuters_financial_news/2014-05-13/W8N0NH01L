WARSAW, May 13 (Reuters) - Polish real estate firm Globe Trade Centre <GTCP.WA> and its key shareholder Lone Star are not planning to buy any Polish companies in the near future, the head of GTC's supervisory board said on Tuesday.

"As of today, I don't expect Lone Star or GTC to buy another company in Poland," Alexander Hesse told Reuters in an interview , when asked whether GTC is interested in buying real estate group PHN <PHN.WA>. PHN has a market capitalisation of 400 million dollars and has been put up for sale by the Treasury Ministry, which holds 73 percent of the company.
