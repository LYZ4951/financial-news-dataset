May 13 (Reuters) - Homebuilding stocks are rising and options investors are betting on more gains in names like PulteGroup and D.R. Horton on Tuesday. They're rising after the regulator of Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> laid out new policies that could make it easier for many Americans to get a mortgage.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt said the government-controlled agencies do not have to reduce the size of loans the firms can buy, and can ease standards that govern when banks must buy back faulty loans. [ID:nL1N0NZ0QM]"If limits are not going to be lowered I think that's a net positive for the housing market," said John Canally, investment strategist for LPL Financial in Boston, which owns long positions in two housing sector ETFs <ITB.P><HXB.P>. The PHLX housing sector index <.HGX> is up 0.5 percent on Tuesday. PulteGroup Inc <PHM.N> rose 1.9 percent and D.R. Horton gained 2 percent. Overall options volume in Pulte is nearly 3 times the usual daily volume already, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. D.R. Horton <DHI.N> is also seeing heavy action in the options market with trading volume 3.3 times the usual volume.
