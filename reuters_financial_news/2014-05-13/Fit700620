May 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The South African authorities' ability to sustainably  increase economic growth via structural reform remains a key element of Fitch  Ratings' assessment following the country's general election. Without stronger  growth, faster job creation and a narrowing of the fiscal and current account  deficits, which continue to push public and external debt ratios up, South  Africa's creditworthiness will gradually deteriorate.  A clearer picture of the administration's ability and willingness to tackle the  country's challenges will emerge in the coming months. Important signals will  come from the composition of the cabinet, and whether ministers have prior  experience in their field and a track record in government or the private  sector. Further considerations will be the speed with which the Medium-Term  Strategic Framework, which will make the National Development Plan operational,  is implemented, and post-election rhetoric on issues including land reform,  mines and small businesses.  For many years the African National Congress (ANC), which won last week's  election with 62% of the vote, has tried to steer a course between ideologies  ranging from macroeconomic orthodoxy to a more statist view, without achieving  the growth needed to ease social pressures. The differing views of groups within  the party may partly explain why many policies have been slow to be implemented  or failed to gain traction. Our economic forecasts, which project only a weak  improvement in real GDP growth, to 1.6% in 2014 and 2.2% in 2015, from 0.77%  last year, reflect the fact that the government may continue to struggle to  boost growth.  The ANC's share of the vote fell from 66% in 2009, but the outcome is still a  significant endorsement for the party despite a high-level corruption scandal  and increasingly violent protests against poor service delivery and rising  unemployment.  It is too early to assess whether the modest decline in ANC support and the  emergence of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, will  result in a significant shift in economic policy. The EFF, with a manifesto  calling for wide-scale nationalisation, garnered 6% of the vote, making it the  third-largest party in South Africa.  Voter turnout, although still high at 73%, has been dwindling from a peak of 89%  in 1998, which suggests that voters may be expressing their dissatisfaction with  the ruling party by staying away from the polls, rather than voting for  opposition parties. Voter turnout was lowest in Limpopo at 63%, down from 70% in  the previous elections. This province has been badly affected by service  delivery and labour strikes.
