PARIS, May 13 (Reuters) - Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, France's second-largest listed bank, has up to 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) for organic growth and acquisitions in the next three years, Chief Executive Frederic Oudea told journalists on Tuesday.

"Acquisitions will respect the balance of our capital allocation, our geographies," Oudea said, adding that SocGen could, for example, consider acquisitions in retail banking and private banking in Europe.
