BEIJING, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Attempts by the U.S. Federal Reserve to dial back its super-loose monetary policy are good for China because it shows the world's largest economy is improving, China's Finance Minister was quoted as saying on Sunday.

Lou Jiwei, in Sydney for a G20 meeting, told state news agency Xinhua the Fed's withdrawal of its ultra-loose policy would create short-term liquidity problems in some fragile economies, but China would be unaffected. Lou said China's current focus was on generating high-quality economic growth, producing moderate price pressures while creating a relatively large number of jobs.
