DUBAI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Dubai developer Nakheel [NAKHD.UL] said on Sunday it has initiated early repayment of 2.35 billion dirhams ($639.8 million) of bank debts 18 months ahead of maturity in September 2015.

The state-owned company had accumulated 6.8 billion dirhams of bank debts while building ambitious mega-development projects such as the palm tree-shaped island off Dubai's coast. Nakheel in January said it would repay a portion of its debts ahead of time. [ID:nL6N0KE02W]
