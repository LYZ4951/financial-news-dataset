PRAGUE, April 2 (Reuters) - The Prague Stock Exchange <.PX>, part of the CEE Stock Exchange Group (CEESEG), will shorten the settlement period for trades to two days from three as of Oct. 6 in order to align its operations with other exchanges, the bourse said on Wednesday.

"The shortened time period between the execution of a trade and its settlement covers all securities tradable on the joint trading platform XETRA, settled via the local central security depositories and cleared by the counterparties in Budapest, Ljubljana, Prague and Vienna," the bourse said.
