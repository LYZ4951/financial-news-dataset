FRANKFURT, April 2 (Reuters) -    Shares in Deutsche Post <DPWGn.DE> rise 3.4 percent to the top of Germany's blue-chip DAX index <.GDAXI> in early trade after it unveils new medium-term financial targets.

The world's biggest postal and logistics group sees its group earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) growing by an average of more than 8 percent through 2020. [ID:nL5N0MU0X1] The new targets would imply a 2020 EBIT of about 1.6 billion euros ($2.21 billion) for the mail business and about 4.9 billion euros at the group level, Equinet analyst Jochen Rothenbacher writes in a note to clients, adding that his estimates are lower. "Hence, the targets are a significant positive surprise for us," he says. Reuters messaging  rm://kirsti.knolle.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net ($1 = 0.7249 Euros)   Keywords: MARKETS EUROPE STOCKSNEWS
