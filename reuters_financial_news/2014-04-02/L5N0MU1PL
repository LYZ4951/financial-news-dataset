LJUBLJANA, April 2 (Reuters) - Slovenia has called for expressions of interest in the purchase of 75.6 percent of the country's largest telecoms operator Telekom Slovenia <TLSG.LJ>.

Bids for the company, the largest of the 15 earmarked last year for privatisation, are expected by April 23, state investment fund SOD said on Wednesday. The government and state-owned businesses together own about 75 percent of Telekom Slovenia, which has a market capitalisation of 876 million euros ($1.2 billion), with the remainder in the hands of private investors. A sale is expected to be completed by the end of the year, Economy Minister Metod Dragonja said in March. [ID:nL6N0MF231] Sources close to the deal told Reuters in December that private equity groups and companies such as Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> and Telenor <TEL.OL> could be interested.
