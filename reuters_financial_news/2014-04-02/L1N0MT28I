WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 8.0 struck off the coast of Chile on Tuesday, near the mining area of Iquique, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

It said the quake was very shallow, only 6.2 miles (10 km) below the seabed, which would have made it feel stronger. It was centered 53 miles (86 km) northwest of Iquique.
