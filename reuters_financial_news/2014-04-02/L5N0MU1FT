MILAN, April 2 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco di Desio e della Brianza <DESI.MI> jumped in early trading on Wednesday after the small Italian lender said it would invest 140 million euros to take a majority stake in troubled rival Banca Popolare di Spoleto <BPSP.MI>.

Lombardy-based Banco Desio said in a statement late on Tuesday it would acquire a stake of between 66.8 and 72.2 percent in Popolare Spoleto by buying into a reserved rights issue. [ID:nL5N0MU105] Banco Desio was selected to rescue Popolare Spoleto by the Bank of Italy officials that have been running the Umbria-based lender for more than a year, after an inspection unveiled "serious irregularities and large expected capital losses".
