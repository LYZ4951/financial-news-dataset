FRANKFURT, April 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's biggest bank OTP <OTPB.BU> is moving closer to purchasing loss-making bank MKB [BLGGM.UL] from German state-backed lender BayernLB [BAYLB.UL], three sources close to the matter said on Wednesday.

Both OTP and public sector bank BayernLB have engaged in intense talks in recent weeks and are likely to reach an accord, the sources said. One of the unresolved questions separating the parties from a deal is the price, one of the sources said. Any purchase would help OTP to consolidate its position as Hungary's biggest bank and conform to government plans to move banking assets from foreign into domestic hands.
