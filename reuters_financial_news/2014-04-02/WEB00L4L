OSLO, April 2 (Reuters) - DNB <DNB.OL>, Norway's biggest bank, will book a 596 million crown ($99.76 million) accounting loss on the mark-to-market adjustment of its basis swaps, it said on Wednesday.

The first quarter figure compares to a loss of 233 million crowns a year earlier and a 235 million crown gain three months earlier.  Basis swaps are derivative contracts entered into in connection with long-term funding in international capital markets where the funding currency is converted to crowns.
