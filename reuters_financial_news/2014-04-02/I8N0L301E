MUMBAI, April 2 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Wednesday a final call on issuing new bank licenses would only be given after a decision is reached by the central bank board committee, without providing a specific timeline.

Rajan, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, also called issuing new bank licenses a "regulatory" process that should not come to an end because of a change in government.
