KAMPALA, April 2 (Reuters) - Strong growth in public sector investments will help Ugandan economy grow 6 percent in the 2013/2014 fiscal year compared with a revised 5.8 percent in the previous fiscal year, the central bank said on Wednesday.

Uganda also said it expected the economy to expand by 6.5 percent in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. The country has said it could live without aid that Western donors suspended or diverted in protest at an anti-gay bill that became law in February.
