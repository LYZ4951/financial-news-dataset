FRANKFURT, April 2 (Reuters) - State-rescued German bank Hypo Real Estate [HRESH.UL] sees greater returns from a sale of Depfa Bank [HRXGP.UL] than from winding down the public finance specialist despite a recent deterioration of its profitability, a presentation showed.

"The achievable purchase price is more advantageous than winding down the assets under the government's control", Hypo Real Estate said in a presentation that it prepared for the German government and that was obtained by Reuters. Hypo Real Estate has to sell Depfa by the end of 2014 and its Deutsche Pfandbriefbank [NUEG.UL] arm by 2015 as a condition of the European Commission's approval of its state bailout. According to the presentation, it has received workable offers. Depfa posted a pretax loss of 20 million euros ($27.6 million) in 2013 but had a net profit of 36 million, the presentation showed.
