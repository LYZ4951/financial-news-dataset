LISBON, April 2 (Reuters) - Portuguese debt is attracting growing numbers of foreign investors, including insurers and investment funds, as they return to the market after the country's debt crisis, the head of the IGCP debt agency said on Wednesday.

Confidence in Portugal's ability to ride out its crisis and exit its international bailout as planned in May has grown sharply this year, sending its yields tumbling to their lowest levels since early 2010. Portuguese benchmark 10-year bond yields peaked at 17 percent in 2012 when there were concerns of a debt default and currently trade around 4 percent. "The fact that yields are currently at these levels alone shows confidence in the trajectory of our debt and how it will be managed," IGCP head Joao Moreira Rato told a parliamentary commission. "Investors continue to be very interested and we are seeing increasing numbers of investment funds showing a growing interest," he said. "As the liquidity of our market grows, it will allow some investment funds to become involved." He added that there "were increasing numbers of pension funds interested in Portuguese bonds." Portugal launched 5- and 10-year bond issues in January and February and Rato said many buyers had stuck with those investments in spite of falling yields and rising prices. "Despite this, our investors have not sold, which shows very well the degree of confidence there is in our bonds," he said. Portugal faces bond redemptions of about 9 billion euros on bonds maturing in June and October, but Moreira Rato said the country currently has a cash buffer of 15 billion euros.  Demand for Portuguese bonds will be key as the country prepares to stand on its own two feet and exit the bailout, when it will fully return to financing itself in debt markets.
