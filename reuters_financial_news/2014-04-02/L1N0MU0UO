WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) - General Motors <GM.N> CEO Mary Barra said on Wednesday the company would make public everything related to safety from its internal investigation of the use of defective ignition switches in some cars that led to at least 13 deaths.

"We will share everything and anything that's related to the safety of our vehicles, that's related to this incident," Barra told a Senate committee looking into the recall of nearly 2.6 million vehicles.
