MOSCOW, April 2 (Reuters) - VTB <VTBR.MM>, Russia's No.2 bank, reported net profit for the year of 100.5 billion roubles ($2.9 billion), meeting its own forecast, boosted by stronger net interest income as it grew its loan book.

The bank had made an annual profit forecast of more than 100 billion roubles for 2013 - the same forecast it made but did not meet the previous two years. In 2012 it reported 90.6 billion and in 2011 it made 90.5 billion. [ID:nL6N0E20Y7] [ID:nL5N0JK262]
