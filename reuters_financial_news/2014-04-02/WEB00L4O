PARIS, April 2 (Reuters) - French media and telecom group Vivendi <VIV.PA> on Wednesday said a bailiff had attempted to enter its offices to gain access to documents relating to its sale of French mobile operator SFR.

But the group said its lawyers had opposed the move, which followed a request from French minority shareholder lobbyist Colette Neuville, "after considering the extravagant nature of this procedure." Vivendi said it would apply to a judge for a summary judgment.
