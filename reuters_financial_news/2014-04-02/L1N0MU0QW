SAO PAULO, April 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian phone carrier Grupo Oi SA <OIBR3.SA> on Wednesday launched an offering for up to 22.75 billion reais ($10 billion) in new stock based on Tuesday's closing price, a key step in its planned merger with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA <PTC.LS>.

The launch came less than a day after securities watchdog CVM lifted a suspension on the primary share offering. The company expects to raise fresh capital to beef up CorpCo, the new entity after its tie-up with Portugal Telecom. A pricing date for the deal was not specified in a filing with the CVM.
