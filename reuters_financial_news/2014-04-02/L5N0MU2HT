HELSINKI, April 2 (Reuters) - Nordea <NDA.ST>, the Nordic region's biggest bank, plans to cut up to 300 jobs in Finland, it said in a statement.

Nordea said in January it is aiming to create 900 million euros ($1.24 billion) in cost savings from 2013 to 2015, and the Finnish job cuts are part of the programme. [ID:nL5N0L30CW]
