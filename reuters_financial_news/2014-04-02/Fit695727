April 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned India-based Oil India Ltd's <OILI.NS> (OIL; BBB-/Stable) proposed US dollar notes an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)'.  The notes are rated at the same level as OIL's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of  'BBB-' as they will constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and  unsecured obligations of the company. The final rating is contingent upon the  receipt of final documents conforming to information already received.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Standalone Profile and State Linkages: Fitch assesses the linkages between OIL  and its 67.6% owner - the Indian sovereign (BBB-/Stable) - to be strong, based  on the agency's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage methodology, especially its  strategic and operational linkages. Currently, OIL's standalone rating is at the  same level as the sovereign's. Should the standalone rating be revised down to  below that of the sovereign, OIL's IDR would receive an uplift to equate it to  India's rating based on a top-down rating approach.  Strong Operational Profile but Small Scale: OIL has strong operating experience  of around 50 years. The rating benefits from OIL's low cost ratios, especially  its very low finding and development costs of USD5.4 per barrel. The company's  production cost of around USD8.5 per barrel (excluding levies) is in line with  rating peers, although this is expected to increase over the medium-term. OIL  has a healthy reserve replacement ratio of above 150%, largely organic. OIL's proven reserves were 460m barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at end-March  2013, with proven developed reserves of 84%. OIL's reserves and current  production are much smaller than that of its peers rated in the 'BBB' category,  whose median reserves are at around 2bn boe and median production at 500,000 boe  per day. OIL's profitability per boe is diminished by the large subsidies it  provides to local refiners - currently USD56 per barrel of oil. This fixed  dollar obligation impacts the company adversely, especially when crude prices  are falling. However, Fitch expects this subsidy burden to shrink over time.  Concentration of Operations: OIL's rating also factors in the concentration of  its current reserves and production in northeastern Assam state. Further, out of  its 17 producing fields, the crude production is concentrated in the Greater  Hapjan (38%) and Greater Chandmari (18%) fields. The natural gas production is  slightly less concentrated, with the top three fields accounting for around 50%  of the production. OIL through its pipeline supplies crude oil to four  refineries (total capacity of about 50m barrels) in northeastern India. The  pipeline is also connected to another refinery west of Assam that has capacity  of about 30m barrels. This provides the company some flexibility in diverting  its production in case any customer encounters operating difficulty. We expect  OIL's geographical diversity to improve over time, although production will  continue to be concentrated in Assam in the medium-term.  Mozambique Asset Stake Purchase: OIL has acquired a 4% stake in a gas asset in  the Rovuma basin in Mozambique for USD1bn. The stake will be increased by an  additional 1%. This asset is considered to be one of the largest natural gas  finds, with gas initially in place of 62.6-112.5 trillion cubic feet. Gas  production is likely to start from the fiscal year ending March 2019. If  executed successfully, this will diversify OIL's production and add to its  reserves. The project is at a very early stage, and entails execution risks  inherent to projects of this nature, although the risks are mitigated by the  strong sponsors and operator of the project. Fitch also believes OIL will  continue to expand via other acquisitions.  Solid Credit Metrics: The company has strong credit metrics and liquidity due to  low indebtedness and large cash balances. Fitch's decision to rate OIL at  investment grade on a standalone basis, despite its small scale, is largely  driven by OIL's strong balance sheet. At end FY13, OIL had cash and equivalents  of INR121bn (around USD2bn), and debt of INR12.6bn. The gross debt/EBITDA was  0.3x with gross debt/ proved reserves of USD0.5 per barrel.  While these metrics will weaken after the Mozambique acquisition and its related  capex - which will be largely debt funded - they remain adequate for the ratings  assigned. Fitch expects gross debt/ EBITDA to increase to around 1.5x and gross  debt/proved reserves to about USD2.8 per barrel over the next two years. We  expect OIL will be able to maintain its comfortable liquidity position with a  negative net debt position over the near term. While, Fitch expects OIL to use  some of its cash balances for future M&A, it is likely to maintain strong cash  balances.  The government asked OIL and the largest state-owned upstream player, Oil &  Natural Gas Corporation Limited <ONGC.NS> (ONGC), to jointly acquire a 10% stake in Indian  Oil Corporation Ltd <IOC.NS> (IOC; BBB-/Stable), which the state was looking to divest.  OIL and ONGC each paid INR26.7bn to acquire the stake in March 2014. Fitch does  not expect this to have a major effect on OIL's standalone credit profile. Positive Regulatory Developments: The government had announced that gas prices  will be linked to market prices from April 2014, which is likely to lead to a  doubling of OIL's gas prices to USD8.4/mmbtu from the current regulated price of  USD4.2/mmbtu. This measure has been deferred by the Election Commission of India  till the model code of conduct (for pre-election practices) related to the  general election scheduled for April/May 2014 is lifted. When this measure is  implemented, the gas price increase will boost OIL's EBITDA substantially - in  FY13, gas accounted for more than 40% of its total annual production of 44.9  mboe.  In addition, in October 2013 a government appointed committee recommended that  the discount that oil producers provide to state-owned refiners be retained at  USD56 in FY14. The report stated that in the future, the discount should be  calibrated based on global crude oil prices and be percentage based rather than  an absolute amount. If implemented, this would benefit OIL and other state-owned  upstream companies in India.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include  - An upgrade of the sovereign rating provided the rating linkages with the state  remain intact. - OIL's standalone credit profile of 'BBB-' may be upgraded if it addresses the  current constraints on its scale, asset diversity and profitability, while  maintaining its strong balance sheet position.   Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include - A downgrade of the sovereign rating
