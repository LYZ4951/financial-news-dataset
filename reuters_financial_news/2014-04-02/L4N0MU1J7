April 2 (Reuters) - African budget airline Fastjet Plc <FJET.L> confirmed that its talks with potential long-term backers included easyGroup Holdings, the private investment vehicle of billionaire Stelios Haji-Ioannou.

Fastjet, which already counts the easyJet <EZJ.L> founder as one of its backers, had said last month that it was in talks with a number of potential investors.  Fastjet said on Wednesday that it would make an announcement about the outcome of the discussions in due course. [ID:nRSB8278Da]
