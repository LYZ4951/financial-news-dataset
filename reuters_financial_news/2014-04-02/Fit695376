April 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that there is no impact on the ratings of Norwegian covered bonds from the implementation of its revised criteria (see 'Covered Bonds Rating Criteria', dated 10 March 2014 on www.fitchratings.com).  Norwegian covered bonds are excluded from Issuer Default Rating (IDR) uplift in  the near term because bank resolution legislation remains under development.  Fitch amended its Covered Bonds Rating Criteria to reflect the beneficial  position for covered bonds under bank resolution frameworks where resolution  tools are in place including the bail-in of certain debt, from which covered  bonds are explicitly exempt. The amendment to the criteria is centred on an  uplift above the IDR, ranging from zero to three notches, applied prior to  Fitch's discontinuity risk analysis. Fitch currently rates the following Norwegian covered bond programmes: Sparebank 1, Mortgage Covered Bonds, 'AAA'/Stable Sandnes, Mortgage Covered Bonds, 'AA'/Stable
