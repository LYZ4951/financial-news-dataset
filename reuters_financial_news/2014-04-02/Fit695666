April 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed IM Cajamar Empresas 5, FTA's notes, as follows: EUR68.7m Class A1 (ISIN ES0347431001) affirmed at 'A+sf', Outlook Stable EUR365m Class A2 (ISIN ES0347431019) affirmed at 'A+sf', Outlook Stable EUR135m Class B (ISIN ES0347431027) affirmed at 'CCCsf', Recovery Estimate  0% IM Cajamar Empresas 5 is a static cash flow SME CLO originated by Cajamar Caja  Rural and Caja Rural del Mediteraneo. Cajamar and Ruralcaja megered in October  2012 to form Cajas Rurales Unidas (BB/Stable/B). The transaction is a granular  securitisation of a EUR675m portfolio of secured and unsecured loans granted to  Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed individuals.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the increase in credit enhancement (CE) over the past  year due to the amortisation of the class A1 notes. CE for the class A1 and A2  notes, which rank pari passu, has risen to 44% from 37% at closing. CE for the  class B notes has risen to 20.2% from 17%. The class A notes' rating is capped at 'A+sf' due to the treasury account bank  rating triggers embedded in the transaction documentation. These triggers are  set at a minimum rating requirement of BBB+/F2 for the account bank Banco  Santander <SAN.MC> (BBB+/Stable/F2). The B notes' rating and Recovery Estimate is driven by the nature of the  transaction's waterfall. Under Fitch's most stressful scenarios it is unlikely  that the class B notes will have sufficient excess spread available to repay  principal and interest. The portfolio started to record loans over 90 days in arrears one month after  close these increased steadily until September 2013 and have stabilised at 3.3%  as of 31 January 2014. Loans over 180 days in arrears are currently 2.8% and are  stable. The transaction's default definition is 12 months and as of the January 2014  investor report there were EUR1.6m defaults in the portfolio. The portfolio has  only just started to see defaults, which means there has not been enough time  for recoveries to be worked out.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
