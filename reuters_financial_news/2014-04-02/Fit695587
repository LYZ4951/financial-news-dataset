April 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded Azerbaijani building materials company Baghlan Group FZCO's (Baghlan) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'Restricted Default (RD)' from 'B-', and withdrawn the rating.  Fitch has also withdrawn the expected rating of 'B-(EXP)' on Baghlan's planned  issue of guaranteed notes in December 2013, which failed to take place.  Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for  Baghlan. Baghlan's downgrade reflects the non-payment of debt obligations on its unrated  USD150m 14.75% loan participation notes (LPN). The planned bond issue was  intended to refinance the majority of its debt obligations.  The ratings have been withdrawn as Fitch no longer has sufficient information to  maintain the ratings. The current liquidity position of the group and its  ability to meet maturing debt obligations including with local banks cannot be  assessed.  Fitch was recently notified that Baghlan failed to pay the USD19m interest  payable on 27 December 2013 on its USD150m LPNs. The LPNs were in technical  default on 1 January 2014 following a grace period. As of 7 March 2014 part  payment of USD8m had been made.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Failure to Refinance  Baghlan failed to refinance and extend the majority of its debt facilities as  the company did not proceed with its planned bond issue in December 2013. Access  to medium-term bank funding is constrained by an under-developed banking market  in Azerbaijan. Although Baghlan had largely been dependent on local bank funding  it had issued unrated LPNs in June 2012.   Challenging Debt Maturities  Refinancing risk and its limited ability to extend short-term bank lines is a  key rating constraint. Fitch expects that large portions of Baghlan's assets are  likely to be pledged as collateral to aid refinancing. The agency also does not  expect Baghlan to be able to raise sufficient funds from banks to refinance its  USD150m amortising LPNs with a final maturity in 2015.   Poor Cash Flow Conversion Solid P&L profits posted over the last three years have not fully converted into  cash flow. Negative working capital outflows during 2011 and 2012 have resulted  in a working capital requirement of around AZN181m as at FYE12 (inventory plus  current receivables less current payables). Unless there is a reversal in the  working capital position and payment of the high receivables balance liquidity  problems are likely to persist.   Deferred Consideration from Asset Disposals Although management has indicated that a number of assets have been or are in  the process of being divested these are subject to transaction close and cash  payment. The most material relates to the disposal of its residential and  multi-purpose property portfolio units in central Baku. However, any proceeds  are likely to be used to repay domestic bank debt.
