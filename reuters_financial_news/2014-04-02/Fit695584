April 2 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Taiwan-based Union Insurance Company's (Union) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating to 'BBB+' from 'BBB' and its National IFS Rating to 'AA-(twn)' from 'A+(twn)'. The Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings upgrade reflects improvement in Union's underwriting performance  following efforts over several years to restructure products and its  consistently strong capitalisation. The Positive Outlook takes into account  Fitch's expectation that the improved business quality will support Union in  delivering steady underwriting profits. Union's profitability has improved with annualised ROAE of 12.3% in 9M13  compared with -2.2% in 2012. This mainly reflects its focus on expanding  business segments with favourable loss ratios (such as in the commercial motor  insurance segment). The commercial motor insurance segment accounted for 45% of  direct-written premiums in 9M13 compared with 33% in 2009. The change in product  mix has resulted in improvement in its combined ratio to 89.8% in 9M13 from  98.6% in 2012, excluding the impact of compulsory motor insurance. Union's statutory risk-based capital ratio was sound at above 300% at end-1H13,  compared with the regulatory minimum of 200%. Its capital position provides a  strong buffer against adverse reserve developments, particularly in view of its  low underwriting leverage with net written premiums/adjusted shareholders'  surplus (including shareholders' fund and claims equalisation reserve) at around  1x from 2010-9M13. Investments remain prudent and liquid, with cash and cash equivalents accounting  for 49% of invested assets at end-3Q13, comfortably supporting its insurance  claims. Credit quality in fixed-income portfolios remained sound as they were  mainly government bonds. Equity exposures increased to 16% of total investments  at end-3Q13 from 6% at end-2012, but remained manageable, with equity exposures  representing a moderate 23% of shareholders' equity.
