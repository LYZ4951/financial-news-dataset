KAMPALA, April 2 (Reuters) - Uganda's central bank held its key lending rate <UGCBIR=ECI> at 11.50 percent on Wednesday, citing sluggish private credit growth and an upwards trend in core inflation.

Bank of Uganda (BoU) Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile told a news conference that a faster recovery in lending growth may be impeded by banks trying to improve their credit quality. Ugandan inflation rose above 7 percent on Monday for the first time since October 2013, pushed higher by rising food prices.
