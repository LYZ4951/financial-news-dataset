LONDON, April 2 (Reuters) - Spanish travel firm eDreams Odigeo is expected to price its initial public offering (IPO) at 10.25 euros a share, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, valuing the company at 1.075 billion euros ($1.5 billion).

The source said that orders were limited below 10.25 euros a share and orders below that price risked missing a deal. Another source told Reuters on Monday that eDreams Odigeo had narrowed its price range to 10-10.25 euros from an original range of 9.25-11.50 euros. [ID:nL5N0MT4F2]
