MOSCOW, April 2 (Reuters) - Russian mid-sized lender Binbank plans to buy Moskomprivatbank, a Russian unit of Ukraine's largest lender Privatbank, and may close the deal in two weeks, Interfax news agency quoted Binbank's co-owner as saying on Wednesday.

Mikail Shishkanov also said Moskomprivatbank would change its name to Binbank after the deal is closed.  Last month, Russia put Moskomprivatbank into temporary administration, a move Privatbank's chairman said was due to "political tensions in relations", but which the Russian central bank said was aimed at controlling its assets.
