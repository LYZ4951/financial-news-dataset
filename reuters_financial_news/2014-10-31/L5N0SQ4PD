SIENA, Italy, Oct 31 (Reuters) - An Italian court on Friday sentenced former Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> Chairman Giuseppe Mussari to three years and six months in jail for misleading regulators in relation to a 2009 derivative trade with Nomura <8604.T> that prosecutors say was used to conceal losses.

The court in the city of Siena, where Italy's third-biggest bank is based, also sentenced former Chief Executive Antonio Vigni to the same jail term. Defence lawyers had asked the court to fully acquit both, while prosecutors asked for a 7 year jail sentence for Mussari and 6 years for Vigni.
