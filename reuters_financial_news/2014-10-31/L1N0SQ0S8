NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A gauge of investor expectations on U.S. inflation held its initial rise early Friday following data on core consumer prices that was in line with expectations, even as domestic personal spending fell for the first time in nine months. [ID:nLLAVLEA6A]

Federal Reserve policymakers have remained concerned about the sluggish pace of price and wage growth despite the recent pick-up in jobs creation and a drop in unemployment to below 6.0 percent. The Commerce Department said the index on core personal consumption expenditure, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.1 percent in September, bringing its year-over-year increase to 1.5 percent. A separate government report showed wages and salaries grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter, the largest increase since the second quarter of 2008. [ID:nLLAVLEA6B] The yield differences between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and regular Treasuries or inflation break-even rates grew early Friday, suggesting investors were pricing in a bit more premium on future price growth in the wake of the latest data on prices and wages.
