ZURICH, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Swiss bank Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> said on Friday it added a relatively modest net 390 million Swiss francs ($406 million) to its litigation provision in the third quarter, bucking a recent trend of major banks drastically beefing up legal reserves.     The Zurich-based lender made the declaration in its full third-quarter report, published on Friday, after posting its financial results last week. [ID:nL6N0SI0BW]
