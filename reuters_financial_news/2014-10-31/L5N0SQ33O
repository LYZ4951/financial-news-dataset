LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Britain's top equity index surged on Friday, as unexpected monetary stimulus measures in Japan boosted appetite for stocks around the world.

Banks such as Barclays <BARC.L> and Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> led the way on the blue-chip FTSE 100 <.FTSE> index in terms of percentage gains. Barclays surged 7.2 percent as traders said that new leverage ratio rules set out by the Bank of England for the UK's banks - covering the minimum amount of capital they must hold relative to their exposure to loans that could fall in value - had not proven as harsh as some had expected. Banking sources had expected lenders to have to meet the new targets by 2017 but the Bank of England said they had until 2019 to meet them. [ID:nS8N0O800Z] Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which is 80-percent owned by the British government after it had to be rescued during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, also advanced by 6.4 percent. Even though RBS set aside 400 million pounds ($640.2 million) to cover potential fines for manipulating currency markets, traders chose to focus more on a rise in profits that beat market forecasts. [ID:nL5N0SQ0T2] "RBS is rising after it revealed a third consecutive quarterly profit, and its core capital ratio is improving," said IG market analyst David Madden.  FTSE CONTINUES WINNING STREAK The blue-chip FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> was up by 1.2 percent at 6,541.22 points going into the close of the trading session - adding to a winning run over the last three days and extending a rebound from 15-month lows earlier in October. The FTSE's advance tracked a rally in stock markets around the world after the Bank of Japan said it would accelerate purchases of Japanese government bonds as part of a massive stimulus package to boost growth and inflation. [ID:nL4N0SQ041] Traders said the Japanese move, coupled with expectations of interest rates remaining at record low levels in Britain, United States and Europe for the near-term, would continue to drive investors over to equities for the better returns on offer from the stock market. "I would expect interest rates will remain lower for longer. People will be searching for yield and that will underpin the equity markets through their dividend yield," said Novum Securities technical strategist Adrian Slack. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, the FTSE 100 has a current dividend yield of 5.4 percent - offering a better return than a yield of around 2.2 percent on 10-year British government bonds <GB10YT=RR>. The FTSE hit a peak of 6,904.86 points at the start of September, its highest since early 2000, but then slumped to 15-month lows in October as weak European economic data knocked back stock markets.
