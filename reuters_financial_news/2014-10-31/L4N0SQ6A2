MANILA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Bank of the Philippine Islands <BPI.PS>, the country's most profitable and valuable lender, is looking for acquisition opportunities as it pursues growth ahead of greater competition, its top official said on Friday.

Cezar Consing, president of BPI, said the bank does not have a specific target right now but taking over a local lender is part of its expansion strategy.  "For BPI, we always have to have both organic and inorganic growth in our tool box," Consing told Reuters in an interview at his office in the central business district of Makati. Philippine banks are bracing for stiffer competition ahead of economic integration of Southeast Asia in 2015 and after the Philippines enacted a law allowing foreign banks to take full control of domestic lenders. [ID:nL4N0PW1KF] But Consing said it may not be easy to pursue mergers and acquisitions at this time with smaller banks unlikely to be interested in accepting a take over because they are thriving in a country enjoying robust growth and ample liquidity. "Because the Philippines is growing at a pretty good rate and is so liquid, there is little incentive for the smaller banks to necessarily be part of an M&A transaction," Consing said. "The smaller banks by and large want to remain independent ... and they have the capability of remaining independent."  In April to June, the Southeast Asian economy grew 6.4 percent from a year earlier -- tying with Malaysia for the fastest pace in Southeast Asia -- driven by strong consumer spending, manufacturing and exports. There is a strong case for consolidation in the Philippine banking sector. It is overcrowded with 700 banks and many lenders minnows, with the top seven of 36 commercial banks controlling two-thirds of the industry's assets.  On Oct. 20, the Philippine central bank spelled out new minimum capital requirements for banks, a move that will force some to increase their levels six-fold and which analysts say should accelerate industry consolidation. [ID:nL3N0SF35T] "We may want to do a deal but the other side may not be ready," Consing said. Consing dismissed speculation that BPI has renewed merger talks with the country's fourth largest lender, Philippine National Bank <PNB.PS>.  In 2012, the two banks had discussed the possibility of BPI acquiring a controlling stake in PNB in a deal which could have created the country's biggest lender, dislodging BDO Unibank Inc <BDO.PS>
