LAGOS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves fell 1.94 percent month-on-month to stand at $38.76 billion on Oct. 29, the lowest level in more than three months, data from central bank showed on Friday.

The reserves also dropped 14.28 percent year-on-year, compared with $45.22 billion the same time last year. The reserves were last seen at the current level on July 21, when they stood at $38.72 billion. Since last month Nigeria's central bank has increased the amount of dollars sold at its twice-weekly foreign exchange auction, and also sells dollars directly to banks on the interbank market to provide support for the currency and calm the market.
