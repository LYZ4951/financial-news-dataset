MUNICH/LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Siemens <SIEGn.DE> is likely to pick EQT [EQT.UL] next week to buy its hearing aids unit for about 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), two sources familiar with the matter said.

Danish hearing aid maker GN Store Nord <GN.CO> was also in the running. [ID:nL6N0SG4HB]  Private equity firm Permira, which had been interested, is now out of the race, another source close to the matter said. Siemens' board is expected to make a decision on the matter next Wednesday, all three sources said. Siemens and EQT declined to comment.
