BANGALORE Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers cut their recommended equity allocation in a model portfolio in October for a fifth consecutive month, a Reuters poll showed, increasing bond holdings even as the Federal Reserve ended its six-year bond-buying program.

Asset prices fell sharply in October, the most since January, with crude oil collapsing to just above $81 a barrel, down almost 15 percent in 23 trading days. The S&P 500 <.SPX> fell by 8 percent in the first half of the month. But the benchmark index has reversed losses since Fed chair Janet Yellen's comments on economic recovery were deemed hawkish by market participants and an estimate of U.S. gross domestic product in the third quarter came in better than expected at 3.5 percent. The dollar-index has also rallied to near the levels it was trading at the beginning of October. Lower oil prices, along with a weaker inflation outlook will probably keep the Fed from raising interest rates for many months, despite a slightly more hawkish tone in its latest policy statement. The Fed is expected to raise rates by mid-2015, a Reuters poll economists showed last week. [ECILT/US] "The end of tapering and the eventual increase in interest rates in the U.S. has reintroduced volatility into the equity markets," said Wayne Lin, portfolio manager at Legg Mason Global Asset Management. "As a result, we are slightly under-weighting our equity position in favor of bonds until the market fully digests the shift of monetary policy in the U.S."  Bucking the trend globally is recommended equity allocation into North American stocks, which has increased by 6 percentage points since January, to 72.3 percent of a global model equity portfolio this month. "We believe that the U.S. economy is strong and in a full-blown recovery and we think it will continue to grow after QE and after interest rates begin to rise," Lin added. The poll of 12 U.S. fund managers taken Oct. 15-31 showed the recommended stock holdings in the U.S. and Canada increased at the expense of those in the euro zone. But bond allocations for euro zone and Japan, consistently up since June, were increased as many investors expect further stimulus by central banks there. The Bank of Japan surprised markets earlier on Friday when it announced it would buy bonds at a faster pace - it now intends to purchase bonds worth 80 trillion yen annually compared with 50 trillion yen earlier. A sharp fall in oil prices and weak domestic demand, which is common to both these regions, could heighten inflation worries. A Reuters poll taken this week predicted the European Central Bank will need to expand its balance sheet by around 1 trillion euros for any stimulus program to be effective in boosting inflation.
