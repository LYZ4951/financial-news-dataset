KAMPALA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> was little changed on Friday in quiet trade, but traders said they anticipated moderate depreciation of the local currency next week on dollar demand by importers.

At 1216 GMT commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,700/2,710 compared with Thursday's close of 2,702/2,712. "The market is low on demand, but next week we're still counting on some appetite from importers to come through," said Faisal Bukenya, head of market making at Barclays Bank. The local currency is down 6.7 percent against the greenback in the year to date, and market players broadly expect the shilling to remain under moderate pressure through November as importers ship in goods for year-end shoppers.
