LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - European investors trimmed their equity allocations in October but kept them close to their highest levels in more than three years, betting that accommodative central bank policies would continue to underpin stock markets.

According to a monthly survey of 17 Europe-based asset managers, the average allocation to equities in balanced portfolios was 47.7 percent in October. The equity allocation had risen almost three percentage points in September to 48.6.  That was higher than the long-term 46 percent average equity allocation but down from a 49 percent high in July.  "We are overweight equities, as we think the recent market turmoil was overdone," said Joost van Leenders, chief economist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which runs $650 billion in assets.  World stocks fell 10 percent from the end of September to mid-October but are up 7 percent since then <.MIWD00000PUS>. Investors have been heartened by the outcome of Europe-wide bank stress tests, which showed on Oct. 26 that the region's biggest lenders were broadly in good health [ID:nL5N0SL1LQ] The poll was conducted between Oct. 17-28, before this week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, which ended its six-year bond-buying programme and set the clock ticking on its first interest rate rise in almost a decade [ID:nTLATLEA08] U.S. rates are still likely to stay low for a long time while the European Central Bank has loosened monetary policy to ward off the threat of deflation. It is considering further exceptional measures to boost growth, which markets reckon will include U.S.-style money-printing. Lastly, company earnings on both sides of the Atlantic have been robust so far, with the majority of U.S. and European companies beating profit forecasts for the third quarter. The biggest rise in allocations was to U.S. stocks at 42 percent, which is the highest since at least July 2012. European equity allocations were steady at just under 30 percent. U.S. equities still looked good, said Anders Lund Larsen, portfolio manager SEB Asset management, but it might soon be time to increase exposure in Europe. "We see the biggest opportunities in Europe, where stock valuations are very attractive. (We are) ready to scale up equity exposure when things calm down in Europe," he said. While broad market conditions - low interest rates, low returns and high cash balances - are benefiting stocks, low  inflation in most parts of the world is making bonds an attractive investment too, many say. [ID:nL6N0SJ3K1] Bond allocations inched up to 36.2 percent after falling last month to their lowest in at least three years. They remain three percentage points under long-term average.  U.S. and Canadian bonds were most favoured, with the average weighting up 6.6 percentage points, partly at the expense of euro zone debt, where allocations fell 3 points.  Investors are aware of the risks to equity positioning.  Rafael Gallardo, investment strategist at Natixis Asset Management, highlighted a sharper-than-expected growth slowdown in China and a rapid rise in the two- to five-year section of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as potential worries. "(These) could send the global economy into an abrupt slowdown after a one-, two-quarter lag, and probably provoke an equity crash," Gallardo said.
