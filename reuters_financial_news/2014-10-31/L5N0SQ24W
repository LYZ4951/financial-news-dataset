HELSINKI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Finnish kitchen utensils and tools group Fiskars <FIS1V.HE> on Friday proposed an extra dividend of 2.6 euros per share following its sale of shares in Wartsila <WRT1V.HE> to Sweden's Investor Ab <INVEb.ST> for 639 million euros ($803 million).

Fiskars shares jumped 8.2 percent to 21.98 euros after the announcement. Fiskars said in September it would book a gain of about 450 million euros from the deal and would likely propose to return some of the proceeds as an additional dividend. [ID:nL6N0RK1AC] "After the pay-out, Fiskars will have around 400 million euros of cash from the share sale. I believe they will be taking M&A steps for sure and transform into a global consumer brand company," Inderes analyst Sauli Vilén said.
