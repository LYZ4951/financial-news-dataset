NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A divided U.S. appeals court on Friday rejected UBS AG's <UBSN.VX> bid to compel Nasdaq OMX Group Inc <NDAQ.O> to arbitrate a dispute over how the exchange operator handled Facebook Inc's <FB.O> May 2012 initial public offering.

By a 2-1 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court judge's conclusion that UBS' claims were not subject to arbitration.
