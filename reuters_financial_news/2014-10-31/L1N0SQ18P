SAO PAULO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - TIM Participações SA, the Brazilian wireless carrier controlled by Telecom Italia SpA, is not aware of any attempt by its three rivals in the country to place a bid for it and break it up.

In a securities filing unveiled on Friday, TIM <TIMP3.SA> said neither Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI> nor its board of directors are involved in talks regarding a potential sale of the company. The parties are not aware of any agreement between rivals Mexico's America Movil SAB, Spain's Telefonica SA and Brazil's Grupo Oi SA to purchase TIM Participações, the filing added.
