WARSAW, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Polish banking sector's aggregated net profit rose in the third quarter by 22 percent year-on-year, helped by higher interest income and economic growth, data from regulator KNF showed on Friday.

Banks' net profit rose to 4.4 billion zlotys ($1.31 billion) and their joint net interest income increased by 12 percent to 9.7 billion zlotys, KNF said. Two of Poland's 10 biggest banks,  mBank <MBK.WA>, which is owned by Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, and Millennium   <MILP.WA>, owned by Portugal's BCP <BCP.LS> have already presented their results. They booked earnings growth in line with forecasts.
