DUBLIN, Oct 31 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday he does not believe Britain will leave the European Union as the English are "a reasonable people" and quitting the bloc would be a disaster.

Speaking during a trip to Dublin, Schaeuble said Germany was willing to compromise with the British government, which has said it hopes to have a referendum on EU membership after the next election, but would not pay "any price" to prevent it leaving.
