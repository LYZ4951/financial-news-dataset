OSLO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank will sell foreign exchange equivalent of 250 million crowns ($37.20 million) per day in November after selling 250 million crowns a day in October, it said in a statement on Friday.

The bank made its first purchase of crowns in October to cover the government's non-oil-related budget deficit, a practice the central bank governor said currency markets should get used to. [ID:nL6N0RV1MT]
