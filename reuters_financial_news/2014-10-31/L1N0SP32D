Oct 31  (Reuters) - Following are highlights from remarks delivered by U.S. Federal Reserve officials dating to the policy statement the central bank issued on Oct 29.

OCT. 31 MINNEAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA (Currently votes on the Federal Open Market Committee) Kocherlakota cast a surprise dissent against the Fed's Oct. 29 decision to end its bond-buying stimulus. He said on Friday that the Fed was risking its credibility by failing to respond to an inflation outlook that shows no signs of returning to 2 percent and is "arguably worse" than it was last December. Among actions the Fed could have taken, he said, were to continue to buy bonds at a pace of $15 billion a month, or to vow to keep interest rates near zero until the outlook for the inflation one to two years ahead had risen to 2 percent. "These actions would have put upward pressure on the demand for goods and services and on prices," Kocherlakota said. "Just as importantly, these actions would have communicated that the Committee is determined to do what it takes to push inflation back to 2 percent as rapidly as is possible." [ID:nN9N0RV010]  SAN FRANCISCO FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENT JOHN WILLIAMS  (Currently does not vote on the FOMC) Price-level targeting and nominal-income targeting, two approaches to monetary policy that go beyond the standard inflation-targeting that many central banks use, may offer some advantages in the face of low interest rates and risks to financial instability, Williams said. He said he did not advocate either, but merely floated them as worthy of study. Other Fed officials who have recently discussed those approaches include Kocherlakota and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, among the Fed's most dovish officials. [ID:nN9N0RV00Z]  FOMC STATEMENT
