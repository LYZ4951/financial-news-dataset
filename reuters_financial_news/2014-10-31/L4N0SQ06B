The Treasury on Thursday issued a consultation paper suggesting to give the bank's Financial Policy Committee new legal tools to control residential mortgage lending. The move would allow the Treasury to set mandatory limits on loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios in residential lending.  Under pressure from Britain's Treasury, the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Fein, two biggest parties in the devolved administration in Belfast, agreed to back a budget drafted by the Northern Ireland government that will see public spending be hurt by deep cuts. The budget would likely lead to public spending cuts of up to 1 billion pounds ($1.60 billion).   The Scotland Labour Party is facing a potential electoral defeat in Scotland, with a new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori poll for STV that shows just 23 percent of voters would back the Labour Party if a general election were to be held immediately, compared with 52 percent who would back the Scottish National Party. That would imply 41 Westminster seats that were won in Scotland in 2010 to be no longer in hands of the Labour Party.
