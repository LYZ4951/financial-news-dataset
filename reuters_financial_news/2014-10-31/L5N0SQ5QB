PARIS, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Airbus <AIR.PA> is in talks with China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Ltd (CALG) <1848.HK> for a potential $9-11 billion order of about 100 A320 jetliners, French daily Le Figaro said.

The paper said the Chinese plane leasing firm would sign a memorandum of understanding with Airbus soon, adding that the CALG wants to build up a fleet of at least 100 jets by 2015. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. In 2012, China Aircraft Leasing committed to buying 36 A320 passenger jets at the Farnborough Airshow. Shares of CALG, partly owned by a subsidiary of state-backed financial conglomerate China Everbright Group, were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in July.
