BANGKOK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Friday as steps towards further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan lifted market sentiment. Bank stocks helped Singapore's benchmark touch a one-month high and late buying into large caps boosted shares of Thai PTT <PTT.BK> in Bangkok.

Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> was up 1.2 percent at 3,276.74, its highest since Sept. 30. Shares of United Overseas Bank <UOBH.SI> and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation <OCBC.SI> led the gainers after favourable earnings numbers. [ID:nL4N0SO8WD] [ID:nL4N0SP4XV] The Thai SET index <.SETI> ended up 1.2 percent at 1,584.16, a near one-month high. Shares of PTT <PTT.BK> jumped 3.95 percent, their biggest single-day gain in nearly eight weeks. [ID:nL4N0SO6O0] Most Southeast Asian stock markets ended little changed on the month after suffering losses earlier in the month due to concerns over the health of the global economy.
