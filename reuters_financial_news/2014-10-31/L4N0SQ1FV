SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose to a seven-week peak, while New Zealand stocks hit a fresh record high on Friday, after encouraging U.S. growth data boosted risk appetite, putting them on track for hefty gains this month.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> rallied 24 points to 5,500.6 by 0221 GMT, having climbed as far as 5,514.2, its highest since mid-September. The benchmark has rebounded 4.1 percent this month, following a near 6 percent tumble in September. The move higher was underpinned by a rise on Wall Street on Thursday following a strong reading on quarterly economic growth and another round of upbeat earnings reports. [.N] "The market was reasonably positive in America and what also helped Australian stocks is that bond yields continued to fall and there seems to be a positive correlation between these two asset classes at the moment," said Damien Boey, an equity strategist at Credit Suisse. Industrial stocks gained 1 percent, followed by the financials sector after Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) <ANZ.AX> and Macquarie Group <MQG.AX> released strong results.   ANZ, the nation's No.3 lender by market value, posted its fifth straight year of record profit, helped by gains in its Asian operations and a strong performance at home. [ID:nL4N0SP8ZM]  Macquarie Group, Australia's largest investment bank, posted a 35 percent rise in first-half net profit on Friday, bolstered by its asset management division and a recent focus on housing loans. [ID:nL4N0SP8WV] The mining sector also notched gains, aided by a small rebound in iron ore prices, Australia's top export earner. Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> and BHP Billiton <BHP.AX> jumped around 1 percent. Falling gold prices, however, hurt Newcrest <NCM.AX> which tumbled 4.3 percent to A$9.34, after plumbing its lowest since late January. The New Zealand stock market set a record high for a sixth consecutive session supported by positive company outlooks and month-end positioning. The benchmark NZX-50 index <.NZ50> was up 0.6 percent, having touched a record of 5,405.311. It has gained 2.8 percent this month, its largest increase since March. Gains were broad based with the biggest company Fletcher Building <FBU.NZ> up 1.2 percent to NZ$8.58, and number two stock telecommunications company Spark <SPK.NZ> rising 1.8 percent to NZ$3.17, its highest since early 2008.  Other top-10 stocks with strong showings were Auckland International Airport <AIA.NZ>, Sky TV <SKT.NZ>, and casino operator Sky City Entertainment <SKC.NZ>. Among the mid-cap stocks, pharmaceutical and animal products company Ebos Group <EBO.NZ> was up 2.7 percent to NZ$9.35 after it said it was buying Australian pet food maker BlackHawk. [ID:nWNAS005UD] Transport and logistics company Freightways <FRE.NZ> was 3.1 percent higher at a record NZ$5.70 as it benefited for a second consecutive session from strong first quarter earnings.
