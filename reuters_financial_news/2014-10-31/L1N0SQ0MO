CHICAGO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - CBOE Holdings Inc <CBOE.O>, operator of the largest U.S. stock-options market, on Friday reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings due to a rebound in trading volumes.

Chicago-based CBOE said net income in the third quarter rose to $48.1 million, or 57 cents per share, from $41 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were also 57 cents per share, beating analysts' estimates for 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating revenue was $148.9 million, up from $136.7 million a year earlier. Average daily volume during the quarter rose to 4.952 million contracts from 4.615 million a year earlier. The increase comes after CBOE said in August that it would cut expenses because of weak trading volumes during the second quarter. [ID:nL2N0Q70LW]
