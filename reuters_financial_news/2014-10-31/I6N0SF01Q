MILAN, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The top shareholder at Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> will weigh all the options considered by the midsize lender to plug a capital shortfall unveiled by a pan-European health check, but would prefer a merger before a cash call, its chairman said.

"We will evaluate all options, including M&A, if there are conditions to do it," Paolo Momigliano, chairman of the Carige foundation, which owns a 19 percent stake in the lender, told Reuters on Friday. "There is sufficient time (to pursue a merger)," he added. "From our point of view this would create value."
