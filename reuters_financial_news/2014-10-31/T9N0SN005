TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A Japanese government panel overseeing the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) approved plans for the fund to raise its holding of domestic stocks to 25 percent of its portfolio from a current 12 percent, sources said on Friday.

The panel of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also agreed the $1.2-trillion GPIF, the world's biggest pension fund, should also lower the weight of Japanese government bonds to 35 percent from a current level of around 60 percent, according to the sources.
