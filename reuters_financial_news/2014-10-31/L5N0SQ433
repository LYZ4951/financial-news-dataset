ZURICH, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The deputy chief executive officer of Swiss private bank J. Safra Sarasin resigned on Friday to contest legal investigations initiated against him in Germany, the bank said in a statement.

Swiss authorities have searched the offices of Bank J. Safra Sarasin as part of an investigation led by German prosecutors into dividend stripping, an investment strategy that can be used to help clients avoid taxes. The bank, which was taken over by Brazilian-Swiss private bank Safra in 2011, said last week it had never set up or distributed such products and was cooperating fully with the investigation.

"He also wants to ensure that the personal implications for him do not tarnish the image and reputation of the bank he has served," it said.
