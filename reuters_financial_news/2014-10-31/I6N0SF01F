MILAN, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian bank Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> were suspended from trading after a 2.8 percent fall on Friday as investors continue to fret about how the lender is going to fill the capital gap unveiled on Sunday by a yearlong pan-European health check of banks.

The stock had initially opened up after a 7 percent fall on Thursday but quickly erased gains. Also shares in smaller rival Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> were suspended from trading after a 2.4 percent drop. The stock had initially risen at open.
