WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday issued corrections to the closely watched annual bank stress tests results that were published a day earlier.

Most of the firms either had no change in their capital ratios or at most a 0.1 percentage point difference between Thursday's release and the corrected figures, the Fed said. The biggest change was for American Express <AXP.N>, whose minimum capital ratio under stress declined by 0.5 percentage point to 12.1 percent.
