HANOI, March 21 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VN Index <.VNI> climbed 0.64 percent at midday on Friday, with domestic investors in positive mood after moves this week by the central bank to trim rates and give more time for lenders to tackle bad debts.

Ho Chi Minh City-based Sacombank <STB.HM> led the gains, with shares rising 4.5 percent, followed by property firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> which advanced 1.31 percent. Interest among local investors offset a recent bout of selling by foreigners, said Tran Minh Hoang, an analyst at Vietcombank Securities. "Domestic investors have been excited, maybe too excited, after recent policy changes by the central bank," Hoang said, adding that foreign selling combined with low domestic consumption could pull the index down next month. The State Bank of Vietnam has lowered some key rates while allowing banks more time to reduce their non-performing loan ratios, which are among Asia's highest.
