March 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Telefonica SA's <TEF.MC> (Telefonica)  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', with Negative Outlook, and  Short-term IDR at 'F2'. Please see below for a full list of rating actions.   The affirmation reflects Fitch's view that Telefonica continues to represent one  of the most diverse operating and cash flow profiles among the large incumbent  peer group in EMEA. Compared with Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> (BBB+/Stable) and Orange <ORAN.PA> (BBB+/Negative), Telefonica exhibits stronger geographic diversification, a  lower, albeit significant, reliance on its domestic market, along with  significant scale and leading market positions in its international portfolio.  Management has shown both a resolve and ability to reduce debt through disposals  and cuts to shareholder distributions. A number of headwinds exist including an  intensifying competitive environment in Spain, along with significant currency  volatility, mainly due to operations in Latin America. These downside risks are  reflected in the Negative Outlook, although this will likely be revised to  Stable if our current forecasts are met  in 2014.KEY RATING DRIVERS Proactive Portfolio Management & Deleveraging A spike in leverage, following the 2010 Vivo acquisition and coincident economic  slowdown, has been managed well. A combination of material cuts to its  distribution policy, the sale of non-core assets and stake sales, along with  hybrid issuance has seen the company reduce net debt to EUR46.6bn (EUR43.6bn  adjusted for post FY13 disposals) - i.e. adjusted for 50% equity credit assigned  to the hybrid instruments. This compares with debt of EUR56.3bn at FYE11. Fitch  expects funds from operations (FFO) net adjusted leverage to stabilise around  3.3x in 2014 and beyond, a level that is consistent with the large European  incumbent peer group and a 'BBB+' rating.  FFO net adjusted leverage was 3.2x at  FYE13.  Positive Diversification, Telefonica exhibits stronger portfolio diversification than similarly rated  peers, such as Deutsche Telekom and Orange SA. Of this group, Telefonica is  least reliant on its domestic market at 45% contribution to operating cash flow  (OCF; EBITDA less capex) from Spain in 2013, compared with Deutsche Telekom's  70% from Germany and Orange's 65% from France. Fitch estimates that following  the E-Plus transaction (which remains subject to regulatory approval), Germany  will account for 9% and the UK a 10% contribution - boosting the cash flow from  competitive but nonetheless stronger performing northern European economies,  while Latin America will contribute 39%. Such broad diversification offers  protection against economic cycles as well as structural shifts and maturing  regional trends.Domestic Operating Environment Remains Tough Spain is still Telefonica's single largest market, accounting for 43% of  forecast 2014 OCF. A domestic economy characterised by high unemployment and  weak domestic consumption, along with an increasingly tough competitive  environment will continue to weigh on this part of the business. Telefonica's  "Fusion" quad-play product has fundamentally shifted pricing in the market,  though without slowing the pace of mobile subscriber losses. The incumbent lost  a total of 1.6 million mobile customers in the 12 months to December 2013, while  mobile service revenues contracted by 16%. Aggressive MVNO mobile offers have  had a significant impact on the established operators, while Vodafone's  acquisition of ONO, the country's largest cable operator, is likely to increase  fixed line and quad-play pressures. Domestic EBITDA fell 7% in 2013. Further  contraction is likely in 2014 and may continue beyond, in Fitch's view.   FX Headwinds Currency volatility primarily related to Telefonica's Latin American businesses  had a material impact on 2013 reported results - revenues suffered a negative  EUR5bn currency impact; with a EUR1.7bn effect felt at the EBITDA level.  Currency devaluation in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela has been significant,  with the prospect of any near-term easing in these pressures far from certain.  While its LatAm operations generally report top-line growth and solid underlying  performance, currency volatility removed the underlying growth benefits of the  LatAm business in 2013 and in the absence of any material appreciation will  continue to impact reported group level results in 2014.  Fitch estimates that LatAm countries in 2014 will account for around 39% of  Telefonica's OCF and their currencies at 8% of group debt, giving rise to a  currency mismatch. Euro zone countries are forecast to represent 52% of OCF,  compared with an estimated 80% of euro-dominated debt.   Measured M&A Approach M&A risk at Telefonica is viewed by Fitch as measured and its intentions in this  area have been well-articulated by management. Recent activity has focused on  the sale of non-core operations with the agreed disposal of businesses in the  Czech Republic and Ireland expected to raise around EUR3bn in proceeds in 2014.  Disposal proceeds along with approximately EUR900m to be raised from minorities  (at the Telefonica Deutschland level) in a rights issue accompanying the E-Plus  acquisition will offset the EUR5bn cash component of the German acquisition. The  company's leverage neutral approach to funding this deal underlines caution in  financial policies, which Fitch views positively. The possibility of market  consolidation in Brazil would be a transaction that makes strategic sense -  regulatory barriers to such a development are though considered high.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating actions  include: -FFO net adjusted leverage approaching 3.5x with little expectation that  deleveraging comfortably below this level can be achieved organically.  Mid-single digit or below pre-dividend FCF margin would increase downgrade  pressure.  Positive: Future developments that could lead to a revision of the Outlook to  Stable, are: - FFO net adjusted leverage well below 3.5x on a sustained basis. A mid-to-high  single digit pre-dividend free cash flow (FCF) margin, which is also deemed an  important metric at 'BBB+', on a consistent basis is likely to help stabilise  the Outlook The following ratings are affirmed:- Telefonica SA Long term IDR: 'BBB+'; Negative Outlook Telefonica SA Short term IDR: 'F2' Telefonica Europe BV's [TEFBV.UL]/Telefonica Emisiones' [TEFEMI.UL] bonds: 'BBB+' Telefonica Finance USA LLC's [TEFFI.UL] preference shares: 'BB+'
