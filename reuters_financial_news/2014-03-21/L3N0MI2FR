March 21 (Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc <DRI.N> reiterated its plans to divest its struggling Red Lobster chain and reported third-quarter results in line with analysts' lowered expectations.

The Orlando-based company, which also owns the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains, said on March 3 that severe winter weather hurt sales and profit. [ID:nL3N0M03U1] The company's net income fell to $109.7 million, or 82 cents per share in the quarter ended Feb. 23, from $134.4 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. [ID:nPn1zXZlK]
