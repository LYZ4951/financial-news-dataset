SEOUL, March 21 (Reuters) - South Korean shares tracked Wall Street higher on Friday, finishing the week on a strong note as firm U.S. economic indicators prompted bargain hunters to shrug off concerns over  Federal Reserve policy.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.8 percent at 1,934.94 points, erasing most of Thursday's 0.9 percent fall.  On a weekly basis, the index has recorded its first gain in March by rising 0.8 percent. Foreign investors net sold 66 billion won ($61.3 million) worth of KOSPI shares, positioning as net-sellers for a tenth straight session.
