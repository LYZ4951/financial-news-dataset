STOCKHOLM, March 21 (Reuters) - Sweden should overhaul its tax system to make home owners and mortgage borrowers pay more, the head of forecasting at National Institute of Economic Research (NIER) said on Friday.

Authorities in Sweden are concerned about household debt levels in Sweden that are among the highest in Europe. Lending and borrowing requirements have been tightened, but credit growth is still strong and house prices continue to rise after tripling over the last 20 years. Tax reform is part of the solution to the problem of cooling the housing market, NIER forecasting head Jesper Hansson said. "If you are worried about household debt, it is strange to have a tax system that encourages people to borrow money," he said.  Hansson, who said Sweden needed a broad tax reform across a number of areas, said tax deductions for mortgage interest payments - currently 30 percent up to 100,000 Swedish crowns ($15,600) - should be reduced.   The government should also reintroduce a property tax, scrapped in 2006 by the current centre-right Alliance administration. "It's a great tax base, and if you want to have a redistribution of income, property tax is a way accomplish that," he said. Tax reform should also look at VAT on food and services and reversing a reduction of VAT on restaurant meals, introduced by the current government.
