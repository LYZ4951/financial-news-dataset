SINGAPORE, March 21 (Reuters) - Singapore shares rose on Friday after two days of losses, tracking other markets in the region that attempted to regain balance after scares about the possibility of an earlier-than-expected rise in U.S. interest rates.

The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> was up 0.6 percent at 3,075.6 as of 0521 GMT in thin trading. Turnover was just a quarter of the 90-day daily average by mid-day.   The gain was not enough to recoup the losses made on Wednesday and Thursday, and the index was little changed from a week earlier. Asian markets gained some confidence after Wall Street shook off concerns about Federal Reserve policy. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> added nearly 0.5 percent. [ID:nL3N0MI04W] Real estate stocks, including City Development Ltd <CTDM.SI> and Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd <HKLD.SI>, led the rebound. The real estate index <.FTFSTAS8600> had dropped to a six-week low in the previous session. Golden Agri-Resources Ltd <GAGR.SI> was the worst performer. It fell 0.87 percent to an intra-day low of S$0.57, its lowest in more than two weeks. Malaysian palm oil futures ended lower on Thursday as poor export data stoked concerns of dwindling global demand for the oil. [ID:nL3N0MH1II]
