March 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings today has released its review of U.S. Title Insurer operating performance in a special report entitled 'Title Insurance Industry 2013 GAAP Financial Results'.  'The five publicly traded U.S. title insurers, which make up almost 90% of the  industry, reported 8% growth in title operating revenues to $14.4 billion at  year-end 2013,' said Gerry Glombicki, Director at Fitch Ratings and Title  Insurance Sector Head.  Profitability remained solid for this group in 2013. However, the aggregate  underwriting combined ratio increased by one percentage point to 93.7%.  This  change in underwriting performance led to a decline in the group's pre-tax  profit margin from title operations to 10.4% from 10.8% a year earlier. Several factors contributed to revenue growth including favorable housing market  trends, strength in both purchase originations and commercial markets along with  rising real estate prices. These positive trends were slightly offset by the  reduction in refinance volume, which is expected to decline further in 2014.  Significant economic uncertainty remains around several major macroeconomic  factors such as inflation, employment, taxes, public sector debt levels, and  U.S. monetary and fiscal policies. The level and path these variables take can  greatly influence title insurance results for 2014. Fitch anticipates premium levels to decline but stable profit margins, as  expense management will continue as a prevailing theme for companies in 2014 in  addition to a robust commercial policy order pipeline.
