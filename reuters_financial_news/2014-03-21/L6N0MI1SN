LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - A European Union "quality label" for crowdfunding would help the sector attract more investors to fund economic growth, the bloc's executive body said in a document seen by Reuters.

Crowdfunding allows individuals and small businesses to raise money from pools of investors who can put money into peer-to-peer lending schemes or securities such as unlisted shares. The European Commission, in a draft document to be published next week, said crowdfunding has real potential to finance certain types of projects. The document proposes eight actions, including setting up a European Crowdfunding Stakeholder Forum to promote the sector, the creation of a "quality label" to build trust among users, and tweaking the bloc's state aid rules to allow public money to help crowdfunding platforms in some circumstances.
