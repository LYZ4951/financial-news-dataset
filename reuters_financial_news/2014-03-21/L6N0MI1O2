FRANKFURT, March 21 (Reuters) - Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> on Friday said it was on track to improve profit considerably this year and that it was well-prepared for the ongoing comprehensive risk assessment conducted by the European Central Bank.

"Commerzbank's consolidated profit, both pre-tax and after tax, should be considerably higher in 2014 even in a challenging economic and capital market environment," the bank said in its annual report.
