HANOI, March 21 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed up 0.25 percent on Friday in high liquidity, with local buying appetite offsetting foreign selling that stretched to a third straight session.

Market volume was 230 million shares on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, the highest in one month, according to Reuters data. Foreigners sold a net 195 billion dong of equities on Friday. Property developer Vingroup <VIC.HM> led the gains, jumping 2.61 percent to end at 78,500 dong ($3.72), followed by a 1.3-percent rise for Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, the country's biggest listed bank by capitalisation.Le Dac An, an analyst at Tan Viet Securities, said a selloff by exchange-traded fund Market Vectors Vietnam <VNM.P> had erased gains in earlier trading, but he anticipated sentiment would remain positive in the weeks ahead. The index hit a more than four-year high on Wednesday, boosted by central bank moves to cut key rates and delay the start of a new loans classification procedure, allowing banks more time to tackle bad debts.
