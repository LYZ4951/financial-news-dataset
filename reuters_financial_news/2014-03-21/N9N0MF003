WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve policymaker known for his concern that super-easy monetary policy could provide the kindling for another financial crisis suggested Friday that excessively low expected returns in the bond market may be a sign that it is time to reduce Fed stimulus.

Fed Board member Jeremy Stein essentially suggested that the Fed should be willing to risk the rise in unemployment that could result from tighter monetary policy if the bond market suggests risk-taking is abnormally high.  "I am going to try to make the case that, all else being equal, monetary policy should be less accommodative -- by which I mean that it should be willing to tolerate a larger forecast shortfall of the path of the unemployment rate from its full-employment level -- when estimates of risk premiums in the bond market are abnormally low," Stein said in remarks prepared for delivery at a conference at the bank's Washington headquarters. Stein said his remarks were "conjectural" and were not meant to be a comment on the Fed's current stance of monetary policy. Estimates of risk premiums, or expected returns, in the bond market were exceptionally low last May, he noted.  At the time, the Fed was buying $85 billion in bonds each month to push down borrowing costs and boost the economy, a program widely known as QE3, because it was the Fed's third round of quantitative easing.  "Applied to this period, my approach would suggest a lesser willingness to use large-scale asset purchases to push yields down even further, as compared with a scenario in which term premiums were not so low," he said. Stein added that he did not intend to suggest that policies then were miscalibrated or that reductions to bond buys should have been large.
