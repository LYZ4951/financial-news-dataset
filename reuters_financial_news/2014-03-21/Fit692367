March 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Denmark's new bill on mortgage bond maturity extensions  will help reduce liquidity risk, Fitch Ratings says. But significant refinancing  concentrations and highly leveraged households still require attention to  further reduce systemic risk.  The bill passed parliament on 11 March and introduces mandatory extensions for  Danish mortgage bonds funding longer-term mortgages. The potentially systemic  liquidity risk of a failed refinancing auction is cut by extending the bonds,  initially for 12 months with a 5pp interest rate increase. For short-term and  variable-rate bonds without interest rate cap it also includes an interest-rate  trigger for a maturity extension at this 5pp level. We expect this to be the  most likely driver of extensions, rather than a complete inability to place the  bonds. Borrowers on short-term reset periods would by implication benefit from a  one-year interest-rate cap.  The maturity extension will transfer the refinancing risk from the mortgage  institutions and their borrowers to the investors. It does not address the  significant refinancing concentrations created by a large volume of mortgage  bonds being refinanced during a short time, nor the material proportion of  short-term interest-reset products in the market. We expect the industry to  continue its efforts to lengthen the maturity profile of its funding, which is  important in this wholesale-funded mortgage system with a large mortgage bond  market equivalent to around 140% of GDP.  Some of the consequences of the Danish funding structure are addressed in the  bill, but the causes are not. Danish households are the most indebted in Europe  on a gross basis, although there is a large net financial assets position. As  the savings market in Denmark is focused on pensions and life insurance  products, the liquidity of these assets may be low in times of stress,  exacerbating negative consumption effects in times of slow growth, rising  interest rates, or higher unemployment. The industry's more detailed assessments  of mortgage affordability, recent initiatives to reduce interest tax  deductibility, and increased interest rates on short-term loan products are soft  measures by international standards, but demonstrate a willingness by the  authorities to deal with the problems.
