March 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Beijing Infrastructure Investment's [BEINF.UL] (BII; A+/Stable) USD300m 3.625% senior unsecured notes due 2019 a final long term foreign currency rating of 'A+'. The proceeds will be used primarily for the development of the urban railway transit system  in Beijing, as working capital and for general corporate purposes.  The notes, to be issued by Eastern Creation Investment Holdings Ltd, are  unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Beijing Infrastructure Investment  (Hong Kong) Limited (BII HK), a wholly owned subsidiary of BII. In place of a guarantee, BII has granted a keepwell and liquidity support deed  and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking to ensure that BII HK has  sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations under the guarantee for  the proposed US dollar notes. The notes are rated at the same level as BII's Issuer Default Rating, given the  strong link between BII HK and BII and because the keepwell and liquidity  support deed and deed of equity interest purchase undertaking transfer the  ultimate responsibility of payment to BII. In Fitch's opinion, both the keepwell and liquidity support deed and the deed of  equity interest purchase undertaking signal a strong intention from BII to  ensure that BII HK has sufficient funds to honour the debt obligations. The  agency also believes BII intends to maintain its reputation and credit profile  in the international offshore market, and is unlikely to default on offshore  obligations. Additionally a default by BII HK could have significant negative  repercussions on BII for any future offshore funding. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected  rating assigned on 7 March 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Links to Beijing Municipality: BII's ratings are credit linked to the Beijing  Municipality, the capital of China. BII provides urban rail transport services  and is 100% owned by the municipality. A multi-year funding integration with the  municipal budget, strong government oversight of its capital expenditure and  borrowing plan, and the strategic importance of BII to the municipality result  in a strong likelihood of extraordinary support, if needed. Therefore, BII is  classified as a dependent public sector entity under Fitch Ratings' criteria. Ongoing Funding from Municipality: BII's operations are heavily subsidised by  the Beijing Municipality. The municipal government has also committed to provide  annual capital grants of CNY15.5bn for 2013-35 to continue subsidising BII's  operations and to cover BII's funding needs to expand its rail network. Strong Fiscal Performance of Beijing: Beijing Municipality has robust budgetary  performance, a strong and well-diversified fundamental socio-economic profile  and a very close relationship with the central government (A+/Stable) as the  capital city. The resilient property market in Beijing also strengthens the  municipality's fiscal flexibility. These strengths are partly mitigated by its  moderately high tax-supported municipal debts, contingent liabilities arising  from its municipal government-owned entities as well as relatively weak  transparency. Important Role in Urban Transportation: BII is the sole urban rail transport arm  of the Beijing Municipality through which the government executes its rail  transportation policy. Underground rail transportation has become the key  solution to the city's heavy congestion in surface transportation, which stem  from rapid population growth. Tight Control by Beijing: The members of both the board of directors and board  of supervision of BII are mainly appointed by the municipal government of  Beijing. BII's rail network development plan needs approvals from the central  government's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), while BII's  related financing plan and debt level are also closely monitored by the  municipal government. Moreover, BII is also required to report its quarterly  operational and financial results to the municipal government. Network Expansion: Under the plan approved by NDRC, BII's rail network will  expand from 442km to 664km by 2016. The ambitious expansion increases the  entity's execution risk and financial burden. Moreover, the aggressive  development plan by BII's 29.8% owned listed property development subsidiary,  Metro Land Corporation Ltd., also makes the entity more vulnerable to headwinds  in China's volatile property market. BII undertakes investment, financing, initial stage planning, operation and  development of the urban rail transit system in Beijing. As at end-2013, there  were 17 inter-connecting lines in operation in the Beijing urban rail transit  system, out of which the company operated 14lines.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Significant changes to BII's strategic importance or a diluted government  shareholding and/or reduced explicit and implicit municipal government support  could lead to wider rating gap between BII and Beijing Municipality.
