JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Reuters) - Nigerian bond yields are expected to rise next week in anticipation of further monetary policy tightening by the central bank, which holds its rate-setting meeting next week. In Kenya, Treasury bill yields are set to continue their decline.

NIGERIA Yields on Nigerian bonds are seen rising next week amid expectations that the central bank will adopt further tightening measures to support the local currency at its policy meeting next week. The Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Monday and Tuesday, its first gathering in almost five years without suspended central bank governor Lamido Sanusi. Traders said yields fell initially this week due to the repayment of about 300 billion naira ($1.82 billion) in matured bonds, but the situation was reversed on Friday as some investors took positions in anticipation of the MPC meeting. "Some investors are speculating that there might be further tightening measures by the MPC and a possible aggressive liquidity mopping up via OMO - open market operations - which could eventually lead to rise in yields on bonds," a dealer with United Bank for Africa said.  KENYA Yields on Kenya's Treasury bills are expected to maintain their downward trend next week, though tighter liquidity in the money market is seen limiting the decline.  The central bank will auction 91-day <KE3MT=RR>, 182-day <KE6MT=RR> and 364-day <KE1YT=RR> Treasury bills worth a total 9 billion shillings ($104 million) next week. "This week they were down, next week they will also be down, but very marginally because liquidity has been sucked out of the system (due to tax payments)," a fixed income trader at one commercial bank said.  The weighted average yield on the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill fell to 8.88 percent at auction on Wednesday from 8.95 percent last week, the central bank said. Yields also fell on the 182- and 364-day paper. [ID:nN6E8CB01J] [ID:nN6E8CB01H]
