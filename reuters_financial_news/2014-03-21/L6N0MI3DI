FRANKFURT, March 21 (Reuters) - The new European banking watchdog being set up under the auspices of the European Central Bank should be spun off into an independent institution eventually, ECB Governing Council member Klaas Knot told Germany's Handelsblatt.

Centralising banking oversight for euro zone lenders at the ECB is part of a broader move towards closer integration of the financial sector aimed at restoring investors' trust and averting any future crisis. Knot, who is also governor of the Dutch central bank, said that it made sense to use the ECB's credibility to build up a European banking watchdog and that the crisis left little alternative to such a model. But over the longer term this should change, he said.
