COLOMBO, March 21 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's central bank kept policy rates steady at multi-year lows on Friday, as expected, and said it hopes for a rebound in  private sector credit growth, which fell 5.2 percent year-on-year in January from 7.5 percent a month ago.

"However, the Monetary Board is of the view that the deceleration of the growth in credit to the private sector is temporary," the central bank said in a statement.  " ... going forward, private sector credit is likely to rebound from the second quarter of the year, supported by declining market lending rates, sufficient liquidity levels and increased demand for exports from the advanced economies."
