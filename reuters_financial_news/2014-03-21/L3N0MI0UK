MUMBAI, March 21 (Reuters) - The Indian government has raised more than $900 million by selling a 9 percent stake in Axis Bank Ltd <AXBK.NS>, two sources with direct knowledge of the development said on Friday.

The federal government held 20.7 percent in Axis Bank, India's third-largest private-sector bank by assets, via a trust fund called Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), before the stake sale. The share sale was launched on Thursday in the indicative price band of roughly 1,290 rupees to 1,357 rupees a share, a discount of as much as 5 percent from its closing price on Thursday of 1,357.35 rupees.
