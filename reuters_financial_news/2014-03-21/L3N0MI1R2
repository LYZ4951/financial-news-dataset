BANGKOK, March 21 (Reuters) - Thai stocks fell for a fourth session on Friday as investors stayed on the defensive due to domestic political uncertainty, although the country's Constitutional Court nullified a Feb. 2 general election. [ID:nL3N0MI109]

The benchmark SET index <.SETI> was down 0.07 percent, finishing the week 0.9 percent lower after three consecutive weeks of gains.  The biggest loser was Glow Energy <GLOW.BK>, which shed 8.1 percent. Traders said it was among stocks hit by short selling this week. The court ruling was in line with expectations but the market weakness reflected a risk and possible delay of the new election, a trader at broker Kasikorn Securities said. The court did not mention a new election date but election commission chairman Supachai Somcharoen told reporters after the court ruling that if the political situation is stable enough it would take a minimum of three months to organise the election. Other Southeast Asian stock markets rebounded from the previous session's losses after Wall Street shook off concerns about Federal Reserve policy. [MKTS/GLOB] Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> recouped earlier losses, helped by selective buying in dividend yielding stocks, with top gainers including shares of Perusahaan Gas Negara <PGAS.JK>. It dropped 3.7 percent on the week, Southeast Asia's worst performer. In Singapore, the stock index <.FTSTI> was up 0.5 percent, erasing most of its losses on the week. Property shares such as City Developments <CTDM.SI> led gainers, rebounding after selloffs in property shares early in the week. [ID:nL3N0MI0MU] Late selling sent Philippine shares <.PSI> 1.2 percent lower, the region's worst performer on the day. Manila bourse said foreign investors were net sellers of stocks worth of 266.7 million peso ($5.9 million).
