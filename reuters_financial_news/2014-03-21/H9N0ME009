HONG KONG, March 21 (Reuters) - Shares in China's GOME Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd <0493.HK>, which is backed by private equity firm Bain Capital, were set to open up 11.7 percent on Friday after it reported a better-than-expected profit for 2013.

The company posted an 892 million yuan ($143.95 million) profit in 2013, after cost controls, a wider range of products and an online push helped it return to the black from its first yearly loss in 2012.
