BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - China's largest internet company Tencent <00700.HK> has agreed to spend $180 mln on a 15 percent stake in online services provider Leju Holdings, stepping up its rivalry with fellow online heavyweight Alibaba Group [IPO-ALIB.N].

Tencent also agreed to subscribe to additional Leju shares in a proposed initial public offering (IPO) to maintain the 15 percent equity interest, it said in a joint statement with Leju's owner, real estate services group E-House <EJ.N>. The initial Tencent transaction is expected to close this month, the companies said, and E-House has already filed a draft registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the IPO.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Tencent sharpens focus on WeChat expansion [ID:nL3N0MG2MJ]Breakingviews-Valuing Tencent's chat app an act of faith[ID:nL3N0MH05M] (http://insider.thomsonreuters.com/link.html)   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Tencent's investment brings it a step closer to territory controlled by e-commerce leader Alibaba as both groups, along with search engine company Baidu Inc <BIDU.O>, race to attract more business from China's 500 million mobile Internet users.
