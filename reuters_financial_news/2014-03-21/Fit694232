March 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Bumper 5 (UK) Finance Plc.'s  class B notes and affirmed the class A notes, as follows:  EUR445.8m Class A1 Notes: affirmed at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable GBP 212.1m Class A2 Notes: affirmed at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable GBP 46.1m Class B Notes: upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AA+sf', Outlook Stable The notes are backed by a portfolio of operational auto lease receivables and  their residual values originated by LeasePlan UK Limited, a wholly-owned  subsidiary of LeasePlan Corporation [LEASP.UL] (LPC; A-/Stable/F2).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating actions reflect the considerable build-up of credit enhancement due  to deleveraging since the transaction has entered its amortisation phase in  February 2013. The transaction also benefits from LPUK's purchase commitment of  any residual values at lease contract maturity.  The delinquency rate has been low and as of the latest reporting date (February  2014) equalled 0.92% of the total aggregated discount balance. Cumulative  defaults amount to 1.90%, which is below Fitch's initial base case assumption  for this level of seasoning. The cumulative recovery rate on defaulted loans  currently stands at 77.97%. As of end-February 2014, the transaction default reserve fund was GBP5.59m. It  is unused to date and should continue to amortise. Excess spread is available to  cover losses and remains at healthy levels. This is sufficient to cover all  losses so far without any requirement to draw upon the reserve fund. In addition  to the default reserve, the transaction also benefits from a funded liquidity  reserve (GBP4.4m), set-off reserve (GBP2m), maintenance reserve (GBP20.7m) and  commingling reserve (GBP16.2m). LPUK acts as initial servicer and also coordinates the provision of maintenance  services to the lessees. In Fitch's view, the transaction's counterparty risk to  LPUK is adequately mitigated by (i) the obligation to appoint a back-servicer  within 120 days of certain events, such as a downgrade of LPC below 'BBB-'; (ii)  the liquidity reserve covering around four months of senior expenses and class A  and B interest; (iii) the funding of a commingling reserve for as long as LPC is  rated below 'A'/'F1'; and (iv) the maintenance reserve, which together with the  collected service components of the lease payments, would enable the issuer to  fund maintenance services to the lessees after LPUK's default.
