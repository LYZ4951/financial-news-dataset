March 21 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service cut its outlook on Croatia's "Ba1" government bond rating to "negative" from "stable," citing weak recovery from recession due to the country's flawed economic outlook.

The outlook revision is driven by "Croatia's impaired medium-term economic outlook, owing to competitiveness challenges, continued deleveraging and the growth-dampening effect of fiscal consolidation efforts," Moody's said. (http://r.reuters.com/wez77v)
