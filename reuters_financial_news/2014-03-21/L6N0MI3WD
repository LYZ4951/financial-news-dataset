BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, world No. 1 cablemaker Prysmian <PRY.MI>, Nexans <NEXS.PA>, and several Japanese peers will be fined by the EU antitrust regulator next month for taking part in a cartel, four people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The sanctions from the European Commission are the latest action by regulators against price-fixing by cable producers. Authorities in Japan, South Korea and Australia have already levied million-dollar fines for anti-competitive practices. The United States Department of Justice is also investigating the cable industry.
