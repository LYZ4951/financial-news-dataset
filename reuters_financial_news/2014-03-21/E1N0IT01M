MEXICO CITY, March 21 (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank kept interest rates on hold on Friday as policymakers pointed to slack in the economy while noting that a recent spike in inflation had eased and was unlikely to spur wider price pressures.

The Banco de Mexico maintained its benchmark interest rate <MXCBIR=ECI> at a record low of 3.50 percent, as expected by analysts polled by Reuters last week.
