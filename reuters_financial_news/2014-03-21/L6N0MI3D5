MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - Russia's finance ministry asked the government on Friday to postpone a deadline for moving surplus tax revenues into one of the country's sovereign wealth funds until October, citing instability in financial markets.

The ministry, left unexpectedly with extra revenue for last year, indicated last month that it would convert 202 billion roubles ($5.6 billion) to add to its $87 billion Reserve Fund, one of two sovereign funds financed from oil taxes. However, it halted the programme of buying the equivalent of 3.5 billion roubles a day on March 4, after the rouble plunged to record lows on Russia's declaration of its right to invade Ukraine.  In a document submitted to the government on Friday, the ministry asked to postpone the deadline for its purchases from April to Oct. 1. It said that it had bought 38 billion roubles before halting its programme earlier this month. "In the current situation, the withdrawal of the rouble liquidity in the amount of 174.2 billion roubles would serve as an additional factor for reducing the banking sector's liquidity and could contribute to increased volatility in the financial sector," the ministry said in the document.
