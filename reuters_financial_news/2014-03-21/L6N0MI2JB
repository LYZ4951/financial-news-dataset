LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - Worldwide financial sector merger and acquisition (M&A) activity so far this year is down 14 percent on a year ago, its slowest period for deal-making in two years, Thomson Reuters weekly data showed on Friday.

Year-to-date deal volumes in the financial sector were $43 billion, the data shows, lifted by Mercuria Energy Group's $3.5 billion purchase of JPMorgan's <JPM.N> physical commodities business this week, but still behind the $50.1 billion in deals announced in the same period last year.
