BUENOS AIRES, July 11 (Reuters) - Argentina is willing to continue talks over its debt in order to reach a just solution for all creditors, the economy ministry said on Friday after a meeting between Argentine officials and a U.S. court-appointed mediator in its long battle with holdouts.

But a stay on a U.S. court ruling to pay the holdouts back in full that risks pushing Argentina into default is "essential," especially given the size of the claims in question, the ministry said in a statement.
