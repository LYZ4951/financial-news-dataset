July 10 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> named Greg Guyett co-head of Asia-Pacific banking as part of a management restructuring in the region, Bloomberg reported, citing a memo.

Guyett will succeed Therese Esperdy, who is returning to the United States to become global chairman of the financial institutions group, the report said. The changes are part of a management shuffle in China in the wake of a probe by U.S. regulators into JPMorgan's Asian hiring practices, Bloomberg said.  Guyett was named chief executive of JPMorgan's Greater China region in March, last year. (http://bloom.bg/1sE53TG)  JPMorgan said it hired former UBS AG <UBSN.VX> banker David Li as its new China head, reinforcing its investment banking clout in the world's second-largest economy after the departure of top China banker Fang Fang in March. [ID:nL4N0PL0RY] Guyett will oversee investment banking, equity markets, and other operations in the Asia-Pacific with Tom DuCharme, according to the Bloomberg report. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to requests to comment.
