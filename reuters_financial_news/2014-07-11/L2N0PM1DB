BRASILIA, July 11 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government does not see a merger between Grupo Oi SA <OIBR3.SA> and Portugal Telecom SPGS SA <PTC.LS> at risk, following tension between the companies over Portugal Telecom's debt deals with troubled Banco Espírito Santo SA <BES.LS>, three sources with knowledge of the situation said on Friday.

The sources, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the government is monitoring the situation from afar. The Brazilian government has been a major sponsor of the merger since it was devised last year.
