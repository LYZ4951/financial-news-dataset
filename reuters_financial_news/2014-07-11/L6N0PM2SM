LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Dutch software company Exact Holding <EXAH.AS> is in sale talks with a series of heavyweight private equity funds including Apax [APAX.UL] and KKR <KKR.N> in a take-private deal that could value the company at around one billion euros ($1.4 billion), several sources said on Friday.

Rothschild has been mandated to sell the company which is listed on Euronext Amsterdam, two sources said. EQT and Hellman & Friedman initially explored a potential deal but are no longer in the process.
