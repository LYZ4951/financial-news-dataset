July 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris' (AP-HP) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'AA+' and its Short-term foreign currency IDR at 'F1+'. The Outlook is Stable. Its EUR2bn euro medium-term programme has been also affirmed at 'AA+' and 'F1+'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch rates AP-HP on a top-down basis under its public-sector entity rating  criteria, due to its status as a public hospital establishment (PHE), tight  control by the French State (AA+/Stable/F1+) and its strategic importance to the  government. As a result, the ratings of AP-HP are equalised with those of and  credit-linked to France. As a PHE, Fitch expects that AP-HP would benefit from very strong state support,  in case of need. Although the French government has no legal obligation to  prevent a default, Fitch assumes that it is highly motivated to provide support  and that it has the legal and financial resources to enable AP-HP to meet its  debt service obligations on time. By virtue of its status, AP-HP's assets and  liabilities cannot be liquidated or transferred to entities other than to the  French State. AP-HP is subject to tight supervision by the State. The Council of Minister  appoints AP-HP's Director. Borrowings are subject to approval by the State if  AP-HP exceeds certain budgetary ratios. AP-HP was not subject to this approval  for 2013. Fitch believes that the strength of the State's financial supervision  helps prevent potential budgetary tension. AP-HP performs essential public service through its provision of healthcare  services, medical teaching and research. AP-HP's revenues are highly dependent  on the State's decisions on tariff-setting and on general grants to finance  AP-HP's public health responsibilities. AP-HP's aim is to balance its consolidation account (EUR1m) in 2015 and 2016 for  the main budget. The delivery of this aim is subject to realising efficiency  gains and asset disposals averaging EUR40m per year. Although AP-HP's net result  at end-2013 remained negative at EUR7.5m, it was an improvement on previous  years due to operating expenditure growing below the national trend, and a  rationalisation of its real estate portfolio (EUR50m of disposals in 2013).  AP-HP's long-term debt (EUR2.2bn) reached 31.3 % of operating revenue at  end-2013, close to its target of 30%. While its amortisation profile is less  than smooth, its debt profile does not represent a risk as repayment would be  sufficiently covered by current cash flow. Fitch estimates the net cash flow  would on average be EUR180m per year over 2015-2020. AP-HP has a qualified team  which prudently manages its debt given management's lack of appetite for risk. Fitch considers AP-HP's liquidity arrangements as sufficient in meeting  debt-service requirements. Following the setting up of two rounds of  consultation for credit line renewals in 2014, Fitch considers that AP-HP is  less exposed to the risk of non-renewal, which would limit the costs associated  with these credit lines.
