July 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings, London, 11 July 2014: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Coventry Building Society's <CVB_p.L> (CBS, A/Stable/F1) GBP3.2bn mortgages covered bonds at 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook and increased the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) uplift for the programme to 1 from zero.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The covered bond rating is based on CBS's Long-term IDR of 'A', an IDR uplift of  1, an unchanged Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 4 (moderate risk) and the 87% asset  percentage (AP) that Fitch takes into account in its analysis, which is  equivalent to the 'AAA' breakeven AP at 87%. The Stable Outlook reflects that on  CBS's IDR. The IDR uplift of 1 reflects an increase in CBS's senior unsecured debt to total  adjusted assets to over 5%, which is the threshold defined under Fitch's  criteria. This provides a buffer for covered bondholders should equity and  junior instruments prove insufficient to absorb losses. Fitch views that the  senior unsecured debt-to-total adjusted assets ratio will remain at over 5% in  the medium term given CBS's accessibility to wholesale funding and CBS's  recognition of the diversification benefit of wholesale funding. However, Fitch  is also of the view that it may be easier to liquidate CBS over resolution by  other methods due to its small size and that the UK is not deemed by Fitch as a  covered bond-intensive jurisdiction. Therefore the IDR uplift is limited to only  one notch. The 'AAA' breakeven AP is largely driven by refinancing and reinvestment costs  as a result of a material mismatch of the weighted average life between the  cover pool and covered bonds, and by, to a lesser extent, 'AAA' expected credit  loss.  The unchanged D-Cap of 4 is driven by liquidity gap & systemic risk and systemic  alternative management, which Fitch assesses as moderate. The programme has a  reserve fund, which covers up to three months of interest and senior fees, and  all the five outstanding covered bonds have a 12-month extendable maturity. Fitch takes into account the contractual AP in the asset coverage test which  supports a 'AA' rating on the covered bonds on a probability of default basis.  The contractual AP is also sufficient to achieve recoveries in excess of 91%  should the covered bonds default, supporting a two-notch uplift to 'AAA'.RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating would be vulnerable to downgrade if any of the following  occurs: (i) the IDR of CBS is downgraded by three or more notches to 'BBB' or  below; or (ii) the combined notches represented by the IDR uplift and the D-Cap  is reduced to three or less; or (iii) the AP that Fitch considers in its  analysis increases above Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 87%.  The Fitch breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, among  others, by the profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered  bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance.  Therefore the breakeven AP to maintain the covered bond rating cannot be assumed  to remain stable over time.
