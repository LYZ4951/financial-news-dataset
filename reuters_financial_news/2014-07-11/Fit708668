July 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Singapore-based DBS Group  Holdings' <DBSM.SI> (DBSH) USD750m 2.246% notes due 2019 and USD500m floating rate notes  due 2019 each a final rating of 'AA-'. Both tranches of senior unsecured notes  were issued under the joint USD15bn global medium term note (GMTN) programme  that the entity shares with its fully-owned subsidiary, DBS Bank Ltd. <DBSM_pc.SI> (DBS Bank;  AA-/Stable/F1+). This follows the completion of the issuance of the notes, as well as the receipt  of final documents conforming to information previously received. The final  rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 7 July 2014. This is DBSH's first senior unsecured debt issuance. The company intends to use  the net proceeds from the issuance for its finance and treasury activities,  including the provision of intercompany loans, or other forms of financing, to  DBS Bank and its subsidiaries. DBSH is a bank holding company, and fully owns DBS Bank, which is currently its  only direct operating subsidiary and its main source of recurring cashflows in  the form of dividends. Both entities are assessed to be highly integrated,  operate in the same jurisdiction and are supervised by the Monetary Authority of  Singapore (MAS) on a group-wide basis.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are rated at the same level as DBSH's 'AA-' Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR). This is because the notes constitute direct, unsubordinated and  unsecured obligations of DBSH. The notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities and obligations of  DBSH's subsidiaries, including DBS Bank. Nonetheless, the Viability Rating (VR)  and IDR of DBSH, which reflect the credit profile of its senior unsecured  obligations, are equalised with that of DBS Bank, due to the seamless  integration between the two entities, as well as DBSH's straightforward balance  sheet and low double leverage ratio of 88% at end-2013. DBSH's leverage may  increase with the issuance of senior unsecured debt, but is expected to remain  low overall.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in DBSH's IDR, presently on Stable Outlook, will have an impact on the  issue rating. Further, a change in DBS Bank's IDR, presently on Stable Outlook,  is likely to have a similar rating impact on DBSH. DBSH's ratings may be notched down from those of DBS Bank if their risk profiles  were to diverge, for instance due to a combination or one of the following  factors: significant leverage and/or other equity investments at DBSH's  standalone balance sheet, onerous banking regulations surrounding capital and/or  liquidity flows from DBS Bank to DBSH, or negative developments in the  philosophy on banking group resolution.
