July 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that AyT Cedulas Cajas Global, FTA's (the programme) fixed rate notes' ratings will not be affected by the upcoming amortisation of AyT Cedulas Cajas Global, Series XXIV scheduled to take place on 29 July 2014. The programme is a cash flow securitisation of Spanish mortgage covered bonds  (cedulas hipotecarias or CHs) issued by 15 banks (13 banking groups). The fixed  rate programme's current size is EUR21.7bn and the amount to amortise is  EUR1.45bn.  While each series of notes issued by the programme is collateralised by a  specific pool of CHs, the programme as a whole is protected by two liquidity  facilities, one for fixed-rate notes, and another for floating-rate notes. Each  liquidity facility is shared by all notes of the same interest rate type. When a  series of notes is paid in full, the total amount in the liquidity facilities is  reduced by the contribution of that particular series.  Fitch has received information from the SPV management company indicating that  the maximum drawable amount under the liquidity facility for the fixed rate  notes will be EUR516m after the scheduled amortisation of Series XXIV, down from  EUR565m. We consider this amount sufficiently mitigates the liquidity risk that  may arise in the notes' current rating scenario, most of which are rated  'BBBsf'. Consequently, Fitch believes the amortisation of Series XXIV will not  impact the existing ratings of the notes. We believe obligor concentration is a material risk affecting Multi-Issuer  Cedulas Hipotecarias (MICH) transactions as it can impact the expected default  rate on the collateral. However, the changes in obligor concentrations at the  programme level after the amortisation of Series XXIV do not have any material  rating implications, as the average obligor concentration remains the same  (7.1%), and the maximum concentration increases marginally to 14.5% from 13.5%.  Two banks participating in the fixed rate series of the programme have been  upgraded since our last review, and additionally, three banks are benefiting  from a two-notch IDR uplift assigned as per Fitch's rating criteria. Those  factors are reducing the default expectation of the fixed rate programme under a  'BBB' scenario to 26% from 28.1%. After the amortisation of Series XXIV, 90% of  the fixed-rate notes would be collateralised by CHs judged to be rated 'BBB-' or  above, and 43.8% by CH judged to be rated 'BBB+' or above. Fitch uses its Portfolio Credit Model (PCM) to analyse the default rate of the  CHs. In our analysis, we assumed that the probability of default (PD) of a CH is  equal to the PD of the issuing bank with an IDR uplift of one notch, or two  notches for systemic banks, and we capture a stressed obligor correlation  assumption as all CH issuers belong to the same industry, the banking sector.  Once the default rate is calculated for all rating scenarios, to assess the  liquidity required at each rating level, Fitch uses the contractual interest  rate for the fixed-rate series. Fitch tests liquidity support within the MICH  transactions to ensure that the liquidity available provides at least one year's  coverage. The agency believes one year is a reasonable timeframe to redirect  cover pool cash flows into an alternative collection agent.
