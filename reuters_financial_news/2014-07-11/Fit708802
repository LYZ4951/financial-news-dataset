July 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc.'s <2311.TW> (ASE, BBB/Stable) proposed US dollar senior unsecured guaranteed notes an expected rating of 'BBB(EXP)'. The proposed notes will be issued by its wholly owned subsidiary, Anstock II Limited, and  unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by ASE. The final rating on the notes is contingent upon the receipt of final documents  conforming to information already received. The notes are rated in line with  ASE's senior unsecured rating of 'BBB' as they will represent direct,  unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. The  proceeds from the proposed senior unsecured notes will be used to fund ASE's  special environmental projects.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Market Position: The ratings reflect ASE's leading and expanding global  market share in outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) services.  According to Gartner, ASE's market share rose to 18.9% in 2013 (2012: 17.5%).  ASE benefits from the positive growth outlook for semiconductor demand over the  long term.  In addition, Fitch believes ASE's ability to efficiently build system-in-package  (SiP) products by taking advantage of the miniaturisation trend in packaging  represents a major new market opportunity for the company. Fitch expects ASE's  growing SiP exposure to drive further market share gains in advanced packaging. Strong Technology Leadership: The ratings also reflect ASE's strong technology  leadership in copper wire based packaging technology and in-house expertise at  the system production level. Vertical integration has strengthened ASE's cost  structure and technology development while the synergies between its in-house  packaging/testing, electronics manufacturing services and material businesses  have helped ASE establish a good position in the SiP-related market. All these  have translated into stronger revenue and profitability compared with the  company's closest competitors. Capital Intensive Operations: The ratings are constrained by the capital  intensive nature of the OSAT industry. ASE completed the expansion of its copper  wire-bonding capacity by end-2012, but it is increasing investment from 2014 to  strengthen its ability, product portfolio and capacity for advanced packaging  and SiP-related technologies. However, ASE is relatively well capitalised and  has stronger cash flow from operations than its major rivals. Slowing Deleveraging, Low Headroom: ASE's strong cash flow from operations  should cover its capex needs. However, ASE is committed to higher cash dividend  payments, which will constrain the company's deleveraging pace over the medium  term. Fitch's ratings assume that the company's funds flow from operations  (FFO)-adjusted leverage falls to 2.0x or less by December 2015. While this is  achievable, the company has low headroom at its current ratings; performance  below Fitch's base case may lead to a downgrade in the ratings. Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes that ASE's liquidity will remain  satisfactory. Unrestricted cash of TWD44bn at end-March 2014 covered 110% of its  debt due within one year. While there may be a temporary free cash flow (FCF)  deficit in 2014 due to higher capex and increased cash dividend, Fitch expects  ASE's FCF to be positive in 2015 and 2016, although the extent of FCF generation  will be limited by its dividend policy. ASE is well supported by banks. Unused  banking facilities totalled TWD111.2bn at end-2013.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - operating EBIT margin below 5% (2013: 10.0%),  - funds flow from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage above 2.0x (2013: 2.3x) - negative FCF, all on a sustained basis. Positive: Future developments that may individually or collectively lead to a  positive rating action include:  - operating EBIT margin above 10%,  - FFO-adjusted leverage below 1.0x,
