July 11 (Reuters) - Indonesia's benchmark index fell on Friday from a 13-month closing high hit in the previous session as uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election held earlier this week prompted investors to sell risky assets.

The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> was down 1.7 percent by midday with financial firms leading the losses as Bank Rakyat Indonesia Persero Tbk PT <BBRI.JK> fell 3.2 percent and Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> dropped 1.43 percent. Both presidential candidates, Joko "Jokowi" Widodo and his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto, claimed victory in Wednesday's election, the closest ever in the world's third biggest democracy and biggest Muslim nation with a history of deadly political violence. [ID:nL4N0PL0KB]  The Election Commission will announce the official result around July 22. "Now the uncertainty of Jokowi's win has created uncertainty and this will prevail until July 22," said John Teja, director of Jakarta-based broker Ciptadana Securities. "Foreign investors are buying and local retail and institutional investors are selling. I think the uncertainty may continue even after the president is elected until he appoints the cabinet." Outperforming the Jakarta market, shares of Indonesian  property developer PT Sitara Propertindo Tbk <TARA.JK> jumped more than 50 percent in their trading debut on Friday.
