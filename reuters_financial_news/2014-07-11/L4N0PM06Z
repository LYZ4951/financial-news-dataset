SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - Shares in China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Ltd (CALG) <1848.HK>, Asia's first listed plane lessor, ticked up 2.2 percent on their Hong Kong trading debut as the company seeks to tap into voracious appetite for aircraft in the world's fastest-growing aviation market.

Shares in the lessor, which has a local industry market share of 3 percent, traded at HK$5.65 on Friday, compared with an initial public offering price of HK$5.53 each, the bottom of an indicated range of HK$5.53-HK$7.82. CICC, China Everbright Securities and CCB International were joint bookrunners on the IPO. The IPO by CALG, partly owned by a subsidiary of state-backed financial conglomerate China Everbright Group, raised HK$729 million ($94 million). CALG plans to use nearly all the funds to acquire aircraft.
