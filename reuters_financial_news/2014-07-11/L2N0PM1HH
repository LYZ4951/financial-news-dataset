WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it would be willing to work with congressional Republicans to pass an emergency spending measure to address a flood of undocumented children attempting to cross the southwestern border but urged lawmakers to act quickly.

Asked about lawmaker comments that the president's $3.7 billion request is too high, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the situation requires the government to rapidly step up its response.
