MUMBAI, July 11 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell 1.4 percent on Friday to post its biggest weekly loss since March 2013 as blue chips such as Reliance Industries were hit by a range of factors including profit-taking and disappointment over the budget's lack of specifics.

Shares had surged to a string of record highs since last week ahead of the budget on Thursday, but investors said the government had not spelled out its action on a range of issues, especially in terms of reducing subsidies. Sentiment was also cautious on concerns about Portugal's banking sector that highlighted contagion risk in the euro zone.
