July 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it suspended trading in shares of over-the-counter stock CYNK Technology Corp <CYNK.PK> for two weeks.

In an emailed release, the SEC said it suspended shares "because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions in CYNK's common stock."
