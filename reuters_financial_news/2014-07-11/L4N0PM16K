SHANGHAI, July 11 (Reuters) - Chinese money rates rose this week on cash demand from banks needing to make reserve deposits, pushing the overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> to its highest since February in the middle of the week before falling back.

The weighted average of the seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.74 percent at midday on Friday, up 31.8 basis points from last week's close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> closed near a five-month high, rising 36.29 basis points to 3.31 percent.  Another actively traded tenor, the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, rose 73.27 basis points this week to trade at 4.23 percent on Friday.  "The market has been tight this week because banks needed to pay the reserve deposit on Monday," a trader from a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai said.  In addition, China's liquidity was also affected by foreign exchange data, which showed foreign exchange assets rose a mere 361 million yuan ($58.16 million) in May, down sharply from the 84.6 billion yuan rise seen in April and the lowest growth in 11 months. The slowdown implies a decrease in the circulation of yuan in China and thus a decrease in market liquidity.  "The figure for the PBOC's foreign exchange assets is below expectations, so the central bank needed to conduct open market operations to inject money to maintain market stability." the trader said.  He said this did not necessarily mean that the monetary policy stance has turned toward loosening, despite the central bank making net injections into the money supply via open market operations for nine consecutive weeks, almost completely reversing the drains enacted previously in the year.
