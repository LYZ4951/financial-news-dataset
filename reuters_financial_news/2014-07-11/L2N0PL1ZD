BRASILIA, July 11 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank may signal next week whether it will keep interest rates on hold for the rest of the year or if it might change course soon, economists said in a Reuters poll.

Of the 60 analysts surveyed, all said central bank policymakers will announce next Wednesday that they will hold the benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> at 11 percent. Of the 59 queried on the 2014 outlook, 50 said the central bank will keep rates unchanged through the rest of the year. The remainder expect rate hikes, mostly after October's presidential elections, taking the Selic rate as high as 12 percent. Those views may change depending on if the phrase "at this moment" is retained in the wording of the monetary policy statement on Wednesday, some economists interviewed said. At the bank's last policy meeting on May 28, the phrase was employed in the first of the three sentences in the communique which announced rates were held steady. The phrase's removal would signal the bank will not soon cut interest rates to stave off recession, a number of economists said. Keeping the "at this moment" wording would be seen as opening the door to the prospect of an interest rate change  before the October elections, in which President Dilma Rousseff is running for a second term.  "The optionality of a policy reversal towards easing is still there, even though the authorities' flight plan seems to be to leave the Selic unchanged until the end of the year," wrote Brasil Plural economists led by Mario Mesquita, a former central bank director, in a research note. Brazil's central bank has been one of the world's most active in recent years as it scrambles to control inflation and seeks to fire up a sluggish economy. It slashed rates unexpectedly in 2011-2012 to a record low only to push them back up in a year-long campaign which ended in April. Annual inflation  <BRCPIY=ECI> through June hit the 6.5 percent target ceiling and economy is flirting with recession as industrial jobs shrink. The bank said in its recent quarterly inflation report that keeping interest rates at 11 percent is probably enough to lower inflation towards its 4.5 percent target in 2015 and 2016. Removing the "at this moment" phrase from Wednesday's  monetary policy statement will help it reinforce that message, said Tatiana Pinheiro, an economist with Banco Santander Brasil. "It would raise one-year rate futures, which could help lower inflation," Pinheiro said. "But at the same time, it would reduce the bank's options for future action. This bank seems to be keen on being data-dependent." The interest rate outlook for 2015 is far less certain as a possible Rousseff defeat would lead to changes at the central bank.
