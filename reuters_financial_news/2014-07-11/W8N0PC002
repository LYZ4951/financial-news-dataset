WARSAW, July 11 (Reuters) - Polish rate-setter Andrzej Bratkowski, who dissented from a central bank statement on amendments to a proposed law on the bank, does not have support among colleagues, a source close to the Monetary Policy Council said on Friday.

"This is a lone voice on the Council," the source told Reuters. "The law in Poland does not forbid working on drafts laws and issuing opinions about them."
