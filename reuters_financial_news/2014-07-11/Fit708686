July 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Union Finances Grains' (UFG) commercial paper (CP) programme rating at 'F1'. A list of rating actions is at the end of this comment.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  UFG's French CP programme's Short-term rating reflects Fitch's view that the  four banks guaranteeing the CPs would be extremely likely to honour their  commitment to guarantee the CPs issued under the programme, if required. The  four banks are Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank [SASRBN.UL] (A/Stable/F1), Le  Credit Lyonnais (A/Stable /F1), Credit Cooperatif (A/Stable/F1) and Banque  Europeenne du Credit Mutuel. Banque Europeenne du Credit Mutuel benefits from a  counter-guarantee from Banque Federative du Credit Mutuel [BFCM.UL] (A+/Stable/F1).  The following banks guarantee the repayment of individual tranches of UFG's CPs,  subject to limits on the total volume of CPs:   EUR84m for Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank;  EUR141m for Le Credit Lyonnais;  EUR83m for Credit Cooperatif; and EUR160m for Banque Europeenne du Credit Mutuel The banks' guarantees are not joint, and each bank is only exposed to the CPs it  guarantees.Fitch considers that the bank guarantees are extremely likely to be honoured,  given the huge reputational damage the banks would face if they failed to repay  the CPs and the small amounts guaranteed in absolute terms. These guarantees are  renewed on an annual basis, but are grandfathered (i.e. guaranteed CPs benefit  from the guarantee until they mature).   RATING SENSITIVITIES The Short-term ratings assigned to the CPs individually would move in tandem  with the Short-term Issuer Default Ratings of the banks guaranteeing the related  CPs. Fitch does not assign a rating to UFG as an entity, as it is purely an issuing  vehicle. UFG is a union of agricultural cooperatives (with variable capital)  authorised by the French Ministry of Agriculture. Currently, 32 French cereal  cooperatives are members of the union. UFG's sole purpose is to provide its  members with alternative forms of financing; UFG finances part of the  cooperatives' cereal inventories by issuing CPs. UFG has no funding needs for  itself and its overheads are paid by the member cooperatives. UFG has equity of  EUR1.4m, which bears no relation to the amounts issued on the financial markets. The rating actions are as follows: UFG's Commercial paper guaranteed by Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment  Bank: affirmed at 'F1'  UFG's Commercial paper guaranteed by Le Credit Lyonnais: affirmed at 'F1' UFG's Commercial paper guaranteed by Credit Cooperatif: affirmed at 'F1' UFG's Commercial paper guaranteed by Banque Europeeenne du Credit Mutuel:
