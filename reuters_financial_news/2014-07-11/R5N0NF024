SOFIA, July 11 (Reuters) - Bulgaria will strip Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> of its license, transfer its good assets and liabilities to a unit of the lender and alert prosecutors to possible malpractice at Corpbank, the central bank said.

The statement on Friday follows an audit of Bulgaria's fourth largest-lender, which was taken under state control last month following a run on deposits by clients unnerved by reports accusing the main shareholder of shady commercial deals.  He denies any wrongdoing.
