HONG KONG, July 11 (Reuters) - China shares edged up early Friday, aided by gains for auto stocks on improved first-half car sales and belief that a government policy promoting "green" vehicles will help in the second half.

Hong Kong markets opened lower, following losses overnight on U.S. bourses,  then scratched out gains that couldn't be maintained as banks underperformed.  At midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was flat at 23,230.63 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent. For the week, they were down 1.3 and 1.2 percent, respectively. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was up 0.3 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> rose 0.4 percent at 2,045.40 points.  They were down 1.4 and 0.7 percent this week, respectively, and could have their first weekly loss in three. Both mainland indexes have moved in a 100-point range since May. Zhang Yanbin, an analyst at Zheshang Securities in Shanghai, said investors are unwilling to go short in the current market environment. He said recent moves, including encouragement from regulators for insurance funds to go into shares, should be "positive hints" for markets. Among the top CSI300 boosts, SAIC Motor Corp <600104.SS> added 1.9 percent, while Chongqing Changan Automobile <000625.SZ> climbed 3.2 percent to a record high. During the first half, vehicle sales rose 8.4 percent, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

[ID:nB9N0P6025] Chinese property developers again posted solid gains, with Poly Real Estate <600048.SS> adding 3.1 percent and China Vanke <000002.SZ> 2.2 percent.  On Thursday, Jinan in eastern Shandong province removed restrictions on home purchases.
