July 11 (Reuters) - Indonesia's benchmark index fell on Friday from a 13-month closing high hit in the previous session as uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election held earlier this week prompted investors to sell risky assets.

The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> ended 1.3 percent down with financial firms leading the losses. Bank Rakyat Indonesia Persero Tbk PT <BBRI.JK> and Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK> fell more than 1.5 percent each.  Analysts said local retail and institutional investors sold shares and foreigners were on the buying side. Indonesia saw a net $253.75 million foreign inflow into stocks on Friday.  Both presidential candidates, Joko "Jokowi" Widodo and his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto, claimed victory in Wednesday's election, the closest ever in the world's third biggest democracy.

"I think the uncertainty may continue even after the president is elected until he appoints the cabinet," said John Teja, director of Jakarta-based broker Ciptadana Securities. Outperforming the Jakarta market, shares of property developer PT Sitara Propertindo Tbk <TARA.JK> ended with a 70 percent gain in their trading debut on Friday. [ID:nL4N0PM0KV] In Singapore, United Overseas Bank Ltd <UOBH.SI> ended 3.6 percent up after jumping 4.2 percent in early trade. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited cautioned investors after the bank said it was unaware of any reason that could possibly explain the gain. [ID:nWNBS00IPM]  Most other markets traded weaker with the Philippines <.PSI> ending 0.5 percent down, Malaysia <.KLSE> 0.5 percent weaker and Vietnam <.VNI> ending 0.4 percent lower.
