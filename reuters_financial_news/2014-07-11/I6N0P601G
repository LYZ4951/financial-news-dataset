MILAN, July 11 (Reuters) - Italian white goods maker Indesit <IND.MI> is expected to be delisted from Milan's bourse after Whirlpool <WHR.N> completes the planned buyout of the company, two sources close to the matter said on Friday.

Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances, has agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in smaller Indesit <IND.MI> for 758 million euros ($1 billion) as it pushes ahead to expand its reach beyond its U.S. home market.
