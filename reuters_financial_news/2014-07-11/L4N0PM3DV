LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Investors pulled out money from hedge funds in June at the fastest pace in six months, part of their twice a year adjustments to portfolios, data showed on Friday.

The SS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index, which calculates monthly hedge fund subscriptions minus redemptions, fell 1.77 percent in July to 148.66 points. The index is compiled by fund administrator SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc <SSNC.O> and is based on data provided by its fund clients, which represent about 10 percent of the assets invested in the hedge fund sector, or about $300 billion. "Due to semi-annual redemptions, net flows were negative for the month and represent a new six-month low," said Bill Stone, chairman and chief executive officer at SS&C.
