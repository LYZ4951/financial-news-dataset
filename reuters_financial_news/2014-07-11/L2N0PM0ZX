RIO DE JANEIRO, July 11 (Reuters) - The crisis afflicting Banco Espírito Santo SA <BES.LS>, Portugal's largest listed lender, is unlikely to impact global markets because of its small size, André Esteves, chief executive of Brazil's grupo BTG Pactual SA said on Friday.

Espírito Santo "is a small bank on a global scale. I believe that there is no global contamination stemming from this issue - there is not enough material from a systemic viewpoint," said  Esteves, one of Brazil's most prominent dealmakers, at an event in Rio de Janeiro.
