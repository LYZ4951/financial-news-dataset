SAO PAULO, July 11 (Reuters) - Preferred shares of Brazilian telecommunications firm Grupo Oi SA <OIBR4.SA> jumped on Friday as Portuguese lender Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> calmed investor nerves about potential losses at a web of family-held holding companies behind the bank. [ID:nL6N0PM2H7]

Oi shares have fallen about 20 percent this month on concerns that a planned merger with Portugal Telecom <PTC.LS> would be jeopardized by the latter's exposure to debt it purchased from a BES-linked firm.
