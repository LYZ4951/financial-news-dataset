LAGOS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Ecobank on Thursday said Qatar National Bank (QNB) <QNBK.QA> had acquired a 12.5 percent stake in the African lender from Nigeria's government-owned "bad bank" AMCON.

Stockbrokers told Reuters that $200 million worth of Ecobank <ETI.LG> <EGB.GH> shares were transferred to the Gulf's largest bank on Thursday at 20.01 naira each. AMCON acquired the stake after Ecobank merged its Nigerian operations with failed lender Oceanic Bank, which AMCON helped to recapitalise, before the Ecobank takeover.
