TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Yasuhisa Shiozaki, appointed Japan's new welfare minister in a cabinet reshuffle this week, said "safe and efficient" asset management was a priority for the country's pension fund even as the government is set to overhaul the way it invests.

Shiozaki's job will include supervising the country's $1.26 trillion pension fund. His previous calls to overhaul Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) have led to expectations he could push for it to invest in riskier assets. "The most important thing is that people think the system is trustworthy," he told reporters on Thursday.
