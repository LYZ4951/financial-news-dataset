LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Britain's troubled Co-operative Group <42TE.L> posted a 43 percent fall in first-half underlying profit but said it could face the future with greater confidence after agreeing reforms on Saturday.

The supermarkets-to-funerals group has faced a raft of problems, culminating in it losing control of its bank last year, when it posted a 2.5 billion pounds loss in total. It posted first-half underlying profit of 66 million pounds ($109 million) on Thursday, down from 116 million pounds a year ago.   Richard Pennycook, the interim chief executive who was confirmed in the position on Thursday, said the first-half result showed the scale of work necessary to restore the Group to full financial health.
