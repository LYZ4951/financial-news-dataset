STOCKHOLM, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy will face an unusual situation in 2016 and 2017 with inflation around the Riksbank's 2 percent target and normal growth combined with a rate level lower than seen historically, central bank governor Stefan Ingves said on Thursday.

"As far as I know, it is a combination of normality and a rate level ... we haven't had before," Ingves told reporters. However, he said that the Riksbank's assumption of a neutral rate level remained at around 4 percent.
