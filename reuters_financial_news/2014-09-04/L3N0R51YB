SEOUL, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Seoul shares closed a shade higher on Thursday as investors awaited the results of a European Central Bank policy meeting later in the day.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> edged up 0.25 percent to close at 2,056.26 points.  The main board was propped up by a 1.8 percent gain in Samsung Electronics <005930.KS>, the largest listing on the exchange. It accounts for 13 percent of the KOSPI's market capitalization.  The South Korean won <KRW=> firmed a whisker against the dollar, finding support from local exporters who sold the greenback for settlements ahead of a long holiday weekend.
