OSLO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Swedish investment bank Carnegie is in merger talks with smaller Norwegian competitor Arctic Securities, Norwegian financial daily Finansavisen reported on Thursday.

A deal would further boost Carnegie's position in Norway, while Arctic would benefit from the wider international reach of the Swedish firm, the newspaper said. Carnegie [ALTORI.UL] has around 700 employees, while Arctic has a staff of 115, according to their web sites. The biggest overlaps between the two are in the equity research and stock broking units in Norway, which could face layoffs if a deal is struck, the paper reported. A spokesman for Carnegie declined to comment on the story, while Arctic Securities was not immediately available for comment.
