PARIS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - President Francois Hollande's approval rating hit a record low of 13 percent in August, a poll showed on Thursday, further securing his status as the most unpopular president in France since World War Two.

The survey by pollster TNS-Sofres showed that support for Hollande fell by five percentage points from the previous month, to reach the lowest level ever registered by the institution for a sitting president. The Socialist Hollande has lost backing including among many left-wing voters largely due to frustration over his performance on the economic front, with unemployment close to a record high above 10 percent and growth nearly flat. TNS-Sofres conducted its poll between Aug. 28 and Sept. 1 questioning 1,000 people in face-to-face interviews. That was just after a reshuffle in which Arnaud Montebourg, the outspoken former economy minister, was ousted in a cabinet reshuffle and replaced by 36-year-old former banker, Emmanuel Macron - the latest sign of Hollande's shift to the centre. Hollande has since faced further political difficulties, as his former companion Valerie Trierweiler this week published a tell-all account of their relationship up to the revelation of his affair with actress Julie Gayet. [ID:nL5N0R524M] In addition to describing Hollande as cold and indifferent, journalist Trierweiler wrote that Hollande does not like the poor and in private called them "the toothless" - drawing accusations of hypocrisy for the left-wing leader.
