WARSAW, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The Polish state treasury expects its dividend income next year from state-run companies at 4.5 billion zlotys ($1.4 billion), only a touch lower year-on-year as it plans to scale down privatisation in 2015, the government said in its draft budget.

The treasury, which oversees state assets like Poland's top bank PKO BP <PKO.WA> and the country's oil refiners, as well as Europe's No.2 copper miner KGHM <KGH.WA>, pegged its 2014 dividend income at 4.6 billion zlotys. It also saw its 2014 privatisation revenue at 3.7 billion, but already signalled the figure would be significantly lower, after it cut the number of companies it supervises to around 240 from almost 8,500 right after the fall of communism.
