BANGKOK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets mostly fell on Thursday as profit-taking hit overbought shares in Thailand and Vietnam, while the Indonesian key index retreated from a record closing high in the previous session amid large-cap selling by domestic investors.

Top losers in Bangkok included shares of airport operator  Airports of Thailand <AOT.BK>, which touched a record high on Wednesday amid expectations of a possible relaxation of martial law in some tourist areas. [ID:nL3N0R439T] The benchmark SET index <.SETI> eased 0.2 percent after four straight sessions of gains. Its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell to 70.36 at the close from Wednesday's 73.47. A level of 70 or above suggests shares were overbought. The VN Index <.VNI> in Ho Chi Minh City dipped 0.08 percent as investors took profits from recent gains, with data showing Vietnamese shares in the overbought territory. [ID:nL3N0R531F] Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> was down 0.36 percent at 5,205.32, coming off a record close of 5,224.135 on Wednesday.   Domestic investors were net sellers of shares such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK>, Thomson Reuters data showed. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and the Philippines <.PSI> retreated from gains early in the week, boosted by speculation on the European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus measure, which could lead to foreign fund inflows.
