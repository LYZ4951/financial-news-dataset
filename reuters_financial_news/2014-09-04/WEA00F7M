FRANKFURT, Sept 4 (Reuters) - German industrial services and construction group Bilfinger <GBFG.DE>, which is 20 percent-owned by Swedish activist investor Cevian, sees no imminent danger of being broken up after three profit warnings, its chief executive said.

"The danger that a company will have other owners and a breakup will happen is always there when a company is undervalued," Herbert Bodner told journalists on a conference call.  Although Bilfinger's valuation is not good, Bodner said he did not anticipate being broken up: "I see no immediate danger."
