MUMBAI, Sept 4 (Reuters) - India's BSE index snapped its nine-day winning streak on Thursday as investors pared positions in blue-chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> after a string of record highs earlier in the week, and as caution prevailed ahead of a key ECB meeting.

ICICI Bank provisionally fell 0.6 percent while Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> ended 1.1 percent lower.
