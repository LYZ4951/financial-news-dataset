STOCKHOLM, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at 0.25 percent as expected on Thursday and stuck with its previous forecast that it would start to tighten policy at the end of next year.

All analysts polled by Reuters had said the bank would keep the repo rate unchanged. The majority also expected no change in the rate path, although some had said there was a chance the Riksbank would push back the timing of its first rate hike. [ID:nL5N0R334R]
