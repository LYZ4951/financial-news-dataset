BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - More time is needed to assess the impact of the package of measures the European Central Bank unveiled in June to stave off the risk of deflation, the chairman of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Thursday.

"The June package has not been given enough consideration in our analysis and results of that June package, including the TLTRO, the results are yet to take place. Let's evaluate that as we go along," Dijsselbloem told the European Parliament's economic and monetary committee.
