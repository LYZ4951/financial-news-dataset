BRUSSELS, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The euro zone's recovery remains very fragile and uneven, underscoring the need for structural reforms designed to boost economic growth, the chairman of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Thursday.

"Recent economic data confirm that the recovery in the euro zone remains very fragile and uneven," Dijsselbloem told the European Parliament's economic and monetary committee. "I believe that recent developments underscore the need to push forwards the growth and reform agenda. Fundamental challenges faced by the euro zone are unchanged," he added.
