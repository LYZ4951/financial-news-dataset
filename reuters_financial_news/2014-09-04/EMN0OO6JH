NEW YORK, Sept 4 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Sept 3 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $7.8 billion to $1.048 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $19.8 billion to $1.037 trillion.
