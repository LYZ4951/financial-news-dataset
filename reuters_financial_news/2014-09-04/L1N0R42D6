Sept 4 (Reuters) - CBOE Futures Exchange said on Thursday it plans to launch futures trading on the CBOE/CBOT 10-year U.S. Treasury Note Volatility Index on Nov. 13, pending regulatory review.

"We are pleased to tap into this space by introducing a CBOE Volatility Index futures product that offers customers a way to hedge pure interest rate volatility risk based on U.S. government debt with a single product for the first time," said CBOE Chief Executive Officer Edward Tilly in a statement. The exchange began publishing the index in May 2013, which incorporates futures and options data on the CME Group's CBOT 10-year U.S. Treasury note contract <TYv1>.
