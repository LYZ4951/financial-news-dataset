LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Serco <SRP.L> said on Thursday it had been selected as preferred bidder to continue running Australia's onshore immigration detention services, some rare good news for the British outsourcer after a disastrous year.

The firm, which is in the middle of an overhaul after contract problems, a government ban and falling margins led to a string of profit downgrades, said a new contract would be signed pending commercial negotiations. The immigration contract, Serco's largest, was signed in 2009 but is up for renewal and is seen by analysts as a key deal for the firm to retain.
