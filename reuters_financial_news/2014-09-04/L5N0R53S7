NYIREGYHAZA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Refunds to clients on loans could cost the bank sector in Hungary about 3 billion euros, Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told a conference of economists on Thursday in eastern Hungary.

Varga said this was an estimate by his ministry and the final number would be known only after parliament decides on how banks are to settle the compensation with their borrowers.
