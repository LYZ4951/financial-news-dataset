LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - British building group Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> said it would return up to 200 million pounds ($329 million) to shareholders and reduce its pension fund deficit after agreeing to sell its Parsons Brinckerhoff business for almost $1.24 billion.

The sale of the U.S. professional services division to Canada's WSP Global Inc <WSP.TO>, which is expected to complete in the fourth-quarter of 2014, was announced late on Wednesday.  [ID:nL3N0R45IT] Balfour said on Thursday in addition to the investor payout, around 85 million pounds of the proceeds would be used to reduce the group's pension fund deficit.
