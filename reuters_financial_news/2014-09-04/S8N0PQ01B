NEWPORT, Wales, Sept 4 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the Kremlin on Thursday to pull back Russian troops from Ukraine and to stop supporting rebels in eastern Ukraine.

"We call on Russia to end its illegal and self-declared annexation of Crimea," Rasmussen said at a meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the NATO summit near the Welsh city of Newport.
