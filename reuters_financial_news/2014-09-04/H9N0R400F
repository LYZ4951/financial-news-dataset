HONG KONG, Sept 4 (Reuters) - China shares rose for a fifth straight day on Thursday, boosted by strength in real estate developers after Reuters reported Beijing is relaxing financing rules for listed property firms.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> climbed 0.8 percent to 2,306.86 points, its highest close since May 30, 2013. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings ended at 2,426.22 points, 0.7 percent higher than Wednesday, closing at its highest since Dec. 10. China Vanke <000002.SZ>, the country's largest residential developer, rose 1.8 percent and Poly Real Estate Group <600048.SS> put on 1.0 percent, lending strong support to the CSI300.  Reuters reported on Wednesday that listed developers would be allowed to issue medium-term notes to fund residential housing projects, supplement companies' operating cash flow and repay bank loans.
