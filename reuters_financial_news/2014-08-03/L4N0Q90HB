Private equity firms, including KKR <KKR.N> and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL], are mulling over a $10 billion plan to buy and merge older drug brands of Britain's GlaxoSmithKline <GSK.L> and France's Sanofi <SASY.PA>.  Troubled lender Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> is to be split into 'good' and 'bad' banks, under a 4.9 billion euro ($6.6 billion) rescue plan that will leave its shareholders and junior bondholders with toxic assets.  A report commissioned by London Mayor Boris Johnson is to show that the city could lose close to 1.2 million jobs and lose out on tens of billions of pounds of gross domestic product if UK decides to quit the European Union.  Britain's banks are actively opposed to the creation of an EU financial services chief as they believe the move could fracture the single market and tilt regulations in favour of the eurozone.
