ABU DHABI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Aldar Properties <ALDR.AD>, Abu Dhabi's largest real estate developer, reported a jump in its second-quarter net profit on Sunday, after excluding one-time merger gains in the corresponding period last year.

The builder of Abu Dhabi's Formula One race circuit made a quarterly profit of 506 million dirhams ($138 million), up 168 percent from 189 million dirhams a year earlier, it said. The year-earlier figure excluded 1.06 billion dirhams gained from Aldar's state-backed merger with rival Sorouh Real Estate last year.
