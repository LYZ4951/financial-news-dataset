DUBAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Middle East stock markets may pull back on Sunday, responding to a weak global environment, as most bourses resume trading after long Eid holidays.

Markets in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which reopened early after the holidays, rose on Thursday on the back of strong second-quarter earnings at banks and expectations for similar performances by real estate developers. Since then, however, the global equity market mood has worsened; world markets dropped for a fourth day on Friday, dragged down by Argentina's debt crisis, confusion over U.S. monetary policy and geopolitical tensions.

This may cause investors in the Gulf to become more cautious and temporarily at least end the Saudi Arabian market's <.TASI> surge on the back of news that it will open to direct foreign investment early next year. Aldar Properties <ALDR.AD>, Abu Dhabi's largest real estate developer, reported a 168 percent year-on-year jump in its second-quarter net profit on Sunday morning, after excluding one-time merger gains in the corresponding period last year. That was in line with analysts' estimates. [ID:nL6N0Q9026]
