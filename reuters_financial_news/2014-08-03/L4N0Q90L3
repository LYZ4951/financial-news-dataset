SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen weaker in early trade after Wall Street fell for a second session, although an uptick in gold may cap broader losses as investors eye key retail sales data due out later in the day.

Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> eased 0.5 percent to 5,473, an 83.4-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close.
