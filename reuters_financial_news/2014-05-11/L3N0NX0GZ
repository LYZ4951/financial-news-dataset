May 11 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Cinven [CINV.UL] is looking to sell its French diagnostics business Sebia in a deal expected to be worth around 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion), the Financial Times reported.

The London-based group will appoint an advisor to manage the sale in the next few weeks, the British newspaper said, quoting two people with knowledge of the plan. Private equity groups and trade buyers are expected to put in bids for Sebia, which makes testing equipment for identifying diseases such as blood cancer.
