WARSAW, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Polish Finance Minister Mateusz Szczurek may lose his job in a Cabinet reshuffle expected in the next few days, a senior member of the ruling Civic Platform party said on Thursday.

The departure of Prime Minister Donald Tusk for a new job as chief of the European Council in Brussels has triggered changes in the Cabinet line-up. Tusk has anointed parliamentary speaker Ewa Kopacz as his replacement. Jacek Protasiewicz, head of the Civic Platform party in the Lower Silesia region, said in a radio interview when asked about the finance minister's job:  "I think that in this area, you'll see a positive change." "There can be a very positive surprise, especially for the electorate waiting for Civic Platform to return to its roots in terms of program," Protasiewicz told private radio station RMF FM.
