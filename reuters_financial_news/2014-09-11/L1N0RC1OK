WASHINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The state attorneys general who are working with the U.S. Justice Department to determine whether Comcast's deal to buy Time Warner Cable is legal have expanded their investigation to include AT&T Inc's <T.N> plans to buy DirecTV <DTV.O>, according to sources close to the merger probe.

Some two dozen states were already coordinating with the Justice Department to interview critics and proponents of the Comcast merger. They have broadened their focus to include AT&T's $48.5 billion proposed deal for DirecTV, the No. 1 U.S. satellite provider.
