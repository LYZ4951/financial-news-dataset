LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Argos-owner Home Retail Group <HOME.L> said the group had not taken a decision to sell its Homebase D.I.Y chain amid media speculation that the group could sell the division to private equity investors.

"Homebase is good business, and its a business that has performed well during its peak trading (period)," said John Walden, who is reviewing the group's structure and strategy.
