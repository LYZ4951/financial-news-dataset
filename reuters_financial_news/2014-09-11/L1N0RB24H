BUENOS AIRES, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Argentina's Congress gave final approval on Thursday to a law proposing to restructure the country's debt in order to skirt a U.S. court ruling that toppled it into its second default in 12 years.

The lower house of Congress passed the debt restructuring plan by an early-morning vote of 134 to 99 following a marathon debate that started Wednesday afternoon. The bill had already been approved last week by Argentina's Senate.
