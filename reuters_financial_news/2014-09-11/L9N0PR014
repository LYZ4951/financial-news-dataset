LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The Bank of England has granted a wholesale banking licence to Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <1398.HK> <601398.SS>, China's largest bank, a spokeswoman for the British central bank said on Thursday.

The news comes ahead of a meeting between British finance minister George Osborne and Chinese Vice-Premier Ma Kai on Friday as part of an annual financial dialogue. The wholesale banking licence does not permit ICBC to take British retail deposits, the BoE spokeswoman added.
