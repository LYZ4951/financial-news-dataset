MUMBAI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a third consecutive session on Thursday to hit their lowest level in two weeks as three state-run companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS>, slumped after the government announced it would pare its stakes in them.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.23 percent lower at 26,995.87 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> fell 0.1 percent to 8,085.70.
