SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Australian shares reversed early gains to slip 0.2 percent on Thursday as weakness among miners, while investors dumped retailer Myer Holdings Ltd <MYR.AX>  after a disappointing earnings report.

But, with the Aussie dollar weakening, stocks in companies who receive a large portion of their revenues in U.S. dollars helped shore up the market. Myer dropped 8.5 pecent to trade at six-week lows after the department store operator posted a 22.6 percent fall in annual profit. [ID:nL3N0RB2A9] Stocks in the resources space suffered as spot iron ore prices fell to a fresh 5-year low on Wednesday due to a supply glut. Global iron ore miner BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> dipped 0.6 percent, and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd <FMG.AX> lost 2 percent. The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> declined 9.2 points to 5,565.1 by 0258 GMT, its second session of losses. The benchmark had its worst day in a month on Wednesday, losing 0.6 percent. The benchmark index had struck a six-year peak of 5,679.5 on Aug. 21, but since then the market has fallen to 3-1/2 week lows on global growth worries, geopolitical tensions and weak iron ore prices. "We're very bearish on the whole iron ore space," said Shawn Hickman, managing director at Market Matters in Sydney. "With the exception of any companies with U.S. earnings, the market looks very, very heavy." Stocks exposed to U.S. markets climbed higher as the Australian dollar hovered around five-month lows of $0.9183 against the U.S. dollar.  Among these, QBE Insurance Ltd <QBE.AX> jumped 2.8 percent to a five-month high of A$12.10, blood products maker CSL Ltd <CSL.AX> climbed 1.2 percent, while pallet-maker Brambles Ltd <BXB.AX> gained 1.5 percent.  Elsewhere, Australian employment surged by 121,000 in August, far beyond forecasts in the biggest rise in at least three decades. [ID:nL3N0R90Z2] Training and workforce company Vocation Ltd <VET.AX> dropped 4.1 percent after saying it has sucessfully completed its institutional placement to raise A$74 million with new shares issued at a price of A$3.05, a 7.9 percent discount to its close of A$3.31 on September 9.[ID:nWNBS00P1D]  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> added 0.3 percent, or 18.2 points, to 5,254.9.
