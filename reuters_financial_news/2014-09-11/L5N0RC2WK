COPENHAGEN, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Denmark's Financial Services Authority (FSA) proposed tighter guidelines on Thursday to limit risk for mortgage lenders in a country whose private household debt is the highest in the developed world.

The guidelines need a parliamentary vote to come into effect as regulations.  The high share of interest-only loans in Denmark has worried credit-rating agencies. Danes' debts average three times their disposable income and are worth 148 percent of national output, more than any other nation in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Interest-only loans amount to 820 billion Danish crowns ($142 billion) of the 1.4 billion crown market. "With the 'supervisory diamond', the total amount of interest-only loans will be reduced in the coming years," Minister for Business and Growth Henrik Sass Larsen said in a statement, referring to the Danish name for the guidelines. Scandinavian households in general have a high level of debt, although some economists see that as offset by a culture of personal savings and by high taxation which holds down national debt.

The government has tried to deal with these concerns through a bill passed in February. [ID:nL5N0LB4EZ]  The 'supervisory diamond' from the FSA consists of five guidelines for the six largest mortgage lenders Nykredit[FRNYKR.UL], Totalkredit [FRNYKT.UL], Danske Bank's <DANSKE.CO> Realkredit Danmark, Nordea's <NDA.ST> Nordea Kredit, BRFkredit[BRFFOK.UL] and DLR [DLRKR.UL].  For each of the mortgage banks FSA proposes that from 2018: * Lending growth to market segments of private homeowners, property rental, agriculture and other corporate should be kept to below 15 percent per year. * The sum of the 20 single largest loan exposures should not exceed the mortgage bank's own equity. * When a loan exceeds 75 percent of the property's value, no more than 30 percent of the remaining loan can have a rate that would need to be changed within two years.  The FSA proposes that from 2020: * The share of loans with semi-annual refinancing needs should be lower than 15 percent of the total portfolio. * When a loan exceeds 75 percent of the property's value, no more than 55 percent of the remaining loan can be an interest-only loan.
