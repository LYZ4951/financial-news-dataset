KARACHI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Pakistani stocks ended higher on Thursday, with the benchmark 100-share index of the Karachi Stock Exchange <.KSE> rising 0.56 percent, or 167.06 points, to 29,858.37.

Amid continued foreign inflows and calmness on the political front, cherry picking by investors helped the index post gains. Interest from institutional investors helped cement stocks rally, said Samar Iqbal, a dealer with Topline Securities. D.G. Khan Cement Co Ltd <DGKH.KA> rose 3.9 percent to 83.15 rupees, while Gul Ahmed Textile Ltd <GULA.KA> closed up 5 percent at 68.72 rupees.
