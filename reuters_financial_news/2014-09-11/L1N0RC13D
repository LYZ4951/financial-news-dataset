NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Billionaire William Ackman is close to signing up Allergan <AGN.N> investors who combined own at least 35 percent of the Botox maker to call a special shareholder meeting, according to people familiar with the matter, giving the hedge fund manager a victory in his fight to acquire Allergan.

Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan's largest shareholder with a 9.7 percent stake, has teamed up with Canada's Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc <VRX.TO> to pursue a hostile takeover bid for Allergan.
