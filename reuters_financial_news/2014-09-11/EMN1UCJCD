NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Sept 10 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $3.2 billion to $1.051 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $1.8 billion to $1.039 trillion.
