DETROIT, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Detroit, Syncora Guarantee Inc and other parties will remain in mediation indefinitely over a possible settlement in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, a federal judge ordered on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen, the chief mediator in Detroit's historic bankruptcy case, ordered that mediation, which began on Thursday, will also take place on Friday and will continue "day-to-day thereafter as deemed necessary, until released by the mediators."
