NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - JDS Uniphase <JDSU.O> and Lululemon Athletica Inc <LULU.O> were among the biggest premarket movers on Thursday, with both companies moving on heavy volume and on track for their biggest one-day jumps in years.

Network gear maker JDS gained 13.5 percent to $13.75, on track for its biggest one-day advance since January 2013 a day after it said it would split into two separate public companies. The company will separate its communications and commercial optical products business through a tax-free spin-off to shareholders as part of a plan to expand in the data communication market. [ID:nL3N0RB5AN] Lululemon, the maker of yoga wear, gained 15 percent to $44.35 - its biggest one-day jump since March 2009 - after it reported earnings that beat expectations and also raised its full-year views on both profits and revenue by a modest amount. [ID:nL3N0RC3FE] Also moving on heavy volume was RadioShack Corp <RSH.N>, which last traded down 2.2 percent to 91 cents, though it rose as much as 26 percent earlier in the premarket session.
