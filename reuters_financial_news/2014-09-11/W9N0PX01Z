WELLINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices rose for the first time in four months in August, while the number of houses sold fell, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Friday.

The REINZ said the market was "idling", with buyers and sellers cautious ahead of the Sept 20 election, while the sector was still feeling the impact of central bank limits on low deposit home loans. Higher interest rates were also affecting the market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to keep rates on hold for the rest of the year at least, after raising its cash rate by 100 basis points to 3.5 percent between March and July. It has said the state of the housing market will be a factor in determining when it resumes tightening.  --------------------------------------------------------------- House price index (in pct): MonthPvs month   12 months  NZ total +1.1   -0.7+4.8   Auckland +0.4   +0.7+5.8  Christchurch -0.8   +3.5+1.9   MonthPvs month   Vs yr ago   Houses sold  5,481 5,893  -16.3 pct  Days to sell3837 34  ------------------------------------------------------------
