FRANKFURT, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Germany's DZ Bank [DETGNY.UL], WGZ Bank, MuenchenerHyp [MNCHY.UL] and Apobank <DAVGng.F> expect to pass the upcoming European bank health checks, an executive at the umbrella association of Germany's cooperative banks told Reuters.

"For the cooperative banks which will come under direct supervision by the ECB, we do not expect any capital shortfall," BVR board member Gerhard Hofmann said.  "The network of cooperative banks has 70 billion euros (90.40 billion US dollar) of equity altogether and is well positioned for future challenges." The European Central Bank (ECB) is looking at how 130 of the euro zone's largest banks value assets.  Those banks will also undergo EU-wide tests on whether they have enough capital to weather future crises, before the ECB takes over as as the euro zone's banking supervisor on Nov. 4.
