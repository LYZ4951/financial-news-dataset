HANOI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The Vietnamese government has approved final plans to sell 25 percent of state-owned carrier Vietnam Airlines in a privatisation that will involve an initial public offering of shares, an online newspaper reported on Thursday.

The Hanoi-based airline, with a registered capital of 14 trillion dong ($661 million), will sell 20 percent of stake to a strategic partner or partners, Vietnamese news website NDH quoted a senior government official as saying.  A further 5 percent will be sold to other investors, according to NDH, while the state will retain a 75 percent holding.
