CAIRO, April 17 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound weakened at a central bank dollar sale <CBEO> on Thursday but strengthened on the black market.

The central bank said it sold dollars at a cut-off price of 6.9802 pounds, weaker than the rate of 6.9750 pounds at its last sale on Wednesday. Dollar shortages have fuelled a thriving black market, but the dollar rate slipped on Thursday ahead of a long weekend as people opt to wait until next week to buy. A trader on the parallel market said the dollar was being offered at 7.47 pounds on Thursday, compared with 7.49 on Wednesday. The central bank sold $38.3 million on Thursday, it said. It had offered $40 million.
