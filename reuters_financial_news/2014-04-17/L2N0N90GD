The bank reported an increase in Fixed Income and Commodities net revenue to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion due to a "strong performance in commodities and solid results in credit and securitized products", despite lower volumes across parts of the businesses. JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, the first to report last week, said on Friday its commodity markets VaR fell to its lowest in nine years in the first quarter of 2014 as it prepared to complete the sale of its physical commodities business. On March 19, it an announced a $3.5 billion deal to sell it to Swiss-based trading house Mercuria.
