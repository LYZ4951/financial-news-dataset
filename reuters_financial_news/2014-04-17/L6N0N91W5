LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Britain's Co-operative Group <42TE.L> made a loss of 2.5 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) in 2013, a year it described as disastrous and the worst in its 150-year history.

Co-op, which was hit by a 1.9 billion pound funding gap at its bank, a drugs scandal and an exodus of top executives, said on Thursday the results served as a wake-up call to the serious challenges that it faces.
