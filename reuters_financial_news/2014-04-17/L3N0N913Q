SEOUL, April 17 (Reuters) - South Korean shares and the won closed onshore trade nearly flat on Thursday, as foreign investors' stock buying was offset by institutional investors' selling, while fears of possible intervention from government authorities weighed on the won.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.01 percent at 1,992.05 points. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> stood at 1,038.8 against the dollar, down 0.1 percent from Wednesday's close at 1,037.7.
