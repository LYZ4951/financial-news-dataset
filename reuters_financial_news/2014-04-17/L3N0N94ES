April 17 (Reuters) - High-speed trading firm Virtu Financial Inc has indefinitely postponed its initial public offering plans, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The move comes as high-frequency trading (HFT) is under intense scrutiny, following the release of author Michael Lewis' book "Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt". Virtu's IPO, which was expected in April, was seeking to raise about $200 million to $250 million, valuing the firm at about $3 billion. Reuters reported earlier this month that Virtu delayed the launch of its IPO as it awaited regulatory approval, which was expected within days rather than weeks. [ID:nL1N0MU1DM] Virtu, one of the biggest U.S. HFT firms, is active in making markets on IEX, taking the other side of trades to ensure the market stays liquid.
