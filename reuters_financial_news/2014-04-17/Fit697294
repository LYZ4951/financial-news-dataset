April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report  that the debt servicing capacities of the Metropolitan Municipalities of  Istanbul (BBB-/Stable) and Izmir (BBB-/Stable) have been  affected by a weaker  Turkish lira (TRL) but the impact is not significant enough to result in a  rating change. Fitch assessed the municipalities under different scenarios featuring the  depreciation of the TRL, given their large proportion of unhedged foreign  currency borrowing, and, in the case of Izmir, also the recent interest rate  increase, in view of the share of its variable interest rate debt. Fitch considers that based on 2012 financial data the financial ratios of  Istanbul and Izmir under different scenarios show that they remain consistent  with the medians for the 'BBB' rating category after the TRL depreciation in  2013.  TRL depreciated about 20% against USD and 26% against EUR in 2013, as a result  of the sharp reversal of the capital flows into emerging market economies and  increased political uncertainty. Turkey was especially vulnerable with its  significant external imbalances (current account deficit accounted for almost 8%  of GDP in 2013).
