WASHINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules for banks trading in security-based swaps, a type of derivative, the regulator said on Thursday, laying out how to keep records of their trades and how to report them.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to reform Wall Street brought regulation to the previously unsupervised $690 trillion global swaps market, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in charge of the bulk of the market. The SEC oversees a narrowly defined subset, called security-based swaps. Large Wall Street banks such as Bank of America <BAC.N>, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and Citi <C.N> are the largest dealers of both types of swaps. The Commission voted on its proposal on Wednesday, giving market parties 60 days to comment.
