April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the  National Long-Term Ratings on Indonesia-based PT BII Finance Center (BIIF) and  PT CIMB Niaga Auto Finance (CNAF) at 'AA+(idn)' and PT Wahana Ottomitra  Multiarta Tbk's <WOMF.JK>(WOMF) at 'AA(idn)'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of  rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.  'AA' National Long-Term Ratings denote expectations of low default risk relative  to other issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in  circumstances or economic conditions may affect the capacity for timely  repayment to a greater degree than is the case for financial commitments denoted  by a higher rated category.  'F1' National Short-Term Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS- National Ratings The rating affirmations on the multi-finance companies are underpinned by  support from their higher-rated bank parents. PT Bank Internasional Indonesia Tbk <BNII.JK> (BII; BBB/AAA(idn)/Stable), which is owned  by Malayan Banking Berhad <MBBM.KL> (Maybank, A-/Negative), fully owns BIIF and holds 62%  of WOMF. PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk <BNGA.JK> (CIMB Niaga; AAA(idn)/Stable), which is owned by  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL>, fully owns CNAF. In case of BIIF and CNAF, the ratings take into account their strong linkage  with and strategic importance to BII and CIMB Niaga, respectively, in expanding  the consumer financing business in Indonesia. The ratings also reflect on-going  funding support from the parents to the subsidiaries. In the case of WOMF, the  ratings reflect relatively moderate linkage with BII and hence moderate  probability of extraordinary support from BII. Fitch expects all the three multi-finance companies to maintain satisfactory  stand-alone financial profiles with regular parental support in operations,  funding and capital. Aggressive business growth by CNAF has raised its leverage,  with its debt-to-equity ratio at 7.3x at end-2013. However, Fitch expects the  company to receive a capital infusion in 2014 from its parent to bring down its  leverage. BIIF and WOMF are less leveraged with debt-to-equity ratios of 4.5x  and 5.5x, respectively, at end-2013 compared with the regulatory limit at 10x.  The more challenging economic conditions, including possibly higher interest  rates, are likely to pressure the three companies' asset quality and  profitability in 2014. CNAF's aggressive growth strategy and WOMF's exposure to  higher-risk two-wheeler financing will add to these challenges. BIIF and CNAF focus on providing car financing, while WOMF focuses on motorcycle  financing.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - National Ratings Any significant dilution in ownership by, or perceived weakening of support from  the parents would exert downward pressure on the ratings on BIIF, WOMF, and  CNAF, including the possibility of multi-notch downgrades. However, Fitch sees  this prospect as remote in the foreseeable future, given their strategic roles  in expanding their parents' business exposure in Indonesia's fast-growing  consumer financing market.  Rating upside could arise if BIIF and CNAF are perceived to have become even  more important to BII and CIMB Niaga, respectively. Evidence of stronger  integration between parent and subsidiary (for example, if there is a  significant increase in joint financing portion and cross-selling activities),  and stronger parental support would also be positive for the ratings. The rating  differential between BII and WOMF could narrow in the event of BII increasing  its ownership in WOMF to above 75%, a name sharing arrangement, greater  operational integration between the two entities, or other forms of tangible  support from the parent to the subsidiary.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - Debt Ratings The ratings of the banks' rupiah-denominated senior bonds and medium-term notes  are the same as their National Long-Term Rating. This is because these debts  constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations of the  concerned entities and rank equally with all their other unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations. Any changes in the National Long-Term Ratings would  affect these issue ratings.
