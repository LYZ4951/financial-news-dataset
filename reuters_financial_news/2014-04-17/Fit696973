April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)    Fitch Ratings has affirmed FORCE TWO's notes  as follows:

Class A notes (ISIN: XS0299041037): paid in full Class B notes (ISIN: XS0299041896): paid in full Class C notes (ISIN: XS0299042357): paid in full EUR9.6m Class D notes (ISIN: XS0299044056): affirmed at 'CCsf'; RE: 50% revised  from RE: 0% EUR9.7m Class E notes (ISIN: XS0299045020): affirmed at 'Csf'; RE: 0% The transaction is a cash securitisation of profit participation agreements to  German SMEs. The portfolio companies were selected by equiNotes Management GmbH,  a joint venture of IKB Private Equity GmbH (a subsidiary of IKB Deutsche  Industriebank AG <IKBG.F> ) and Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE>, acting as advisor for the issuer.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of the class D notes at 'CCsf' reflects Fitch's view that  default is probable. The affirmation of the class E notes at 'Csf' reflects  Fitch's view that default is inevitable.  FORCE TWO reached scheduled maturity in January 2014. The companies'  subordinated debt instruments securitised in the pool are bullet loans. They all  became due on two dates, shortly before scheduled maturity. The junior class D  and class E notes were not repaid in full.  Beyond the scheduled maturity date, four companies are still listed as  constituents of the portfolio. As of the last investor report dated 24 January  2014, they had an aggregate outstanding portfolio amount of EUR11.75m. Further,  the manager has recovery expectations for two additional obligors. Taking into  account negotiated amendment agreements as well as on-going partial repayments  by some obligors, Fitch expects belated payments on the outstanding notes from  these recoveries still to be effected until legal maturity in January 2018.  Fitch has thus revised its Recovery Estimate (RE) for the class D notes to 50%  while leaving the RE for the class E unchanged at 0%. REs are forward-looking  recovery estimates, taking into account Fitch's expectations for principal  repayments on a distressed structured finance security.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
