MUMBAI, April 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose more than 1.5 percent on Thursday to snap a three-day losing streak as lenders such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> surged on value buying, earnings expectations and hopes of gains in bond portfolios after the central bank's biggest debt auction.

Indian government bonds jumped on Thursday, recovering from two sessions of falls, after the central bank fully sold the 200 billion rupees ($3.31 billion) worth of debt on offer.
