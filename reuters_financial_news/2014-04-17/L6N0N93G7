TIRANA, April 17 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank launched on Thursday a programme with central banks in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia to prepare them to join the euro zone once they have become members of the European Union.

The three hope to join the EU eventually, though they are unlikely to do so before the end this decade, as the fallout from Yugoslavia's violent collapse in the 1990s as well as corruption and sluggish economic growth continue to slow their progress. [ID:nL5N0F4188] "Strong central banks are key for monetary and financial stability in Europe and around the world," said ECB Executive Board member Yves Mersch at the launch of the programme in Tirana.  "With this joint initiative, the central banking community in the EU stands ready to support our colleagues in the Western Balkans in their endeavour to introduce the highest standards, for the benefit of their countries and people." The EU has allocated 500,000 euros to the programme.
