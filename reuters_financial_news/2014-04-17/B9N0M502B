BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - The chairman of state-owned China Resources Holding Co. Ltd. <CHRESR.UL>, a holding company for a group of businesses in Hong Kong and mainland China, is being investigated for violating party discipline, China's top anti-graft body said on Thursday.

The announcement on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's website comes after a journalist accused chairman Song Lin of setting his mistress up with a job at branches of a foreign bank. Song has denied the charge.
