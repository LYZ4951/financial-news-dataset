BANGKOK, April 17 (Reuters) - Thailand's TMB Bank <TMB.BK> cut its 2014 loan growth target to between 6 percent and 8 percent, saying it was becoming more cautious as political tensions raise concerns about the economy.

TMB Bank, the country's seven-largest lender, had previously forecast loan growth of 8 percent for the year. Its first-quarter loan portfolio, however, grew only 0.3 percent from the previous quarter, leading to the revision of the outlook, Chief Executive Boontuck Wungcharoen said in a statement. Earlier, the bank reported a 12 percent drop in its first quarter net profit. Profit fell to 1.6 billion baht ($49.6 million) for the January-March quarter from 1.8 billion baht a year earlier, with non-performing loan at 3.85 percent of total, down from 3.87 percent at the end of last year.
