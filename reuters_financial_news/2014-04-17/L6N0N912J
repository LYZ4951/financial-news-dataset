DUBAI, April 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian real estate firm Dar Al Arkan <4300.SE> reported a 4.3 percent increase in first-quarter net profit on Thursday, beating analyst forecasts, on the back of higher sales of its developed properties.

The kingdom's largest listed property developer made a net profit of 247.9 million riyals ($66.1 million) compared with 237.6 million riyals in the corresponding period in 2013. The earnings beat forecasts of three analysts polled by Reuters who had expected, on average, a profit of 222.3 million riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0N80UP] Dar Al Arkan said the increase in net profit was mainly due to higher sales of developed properties at higher gross margins.
