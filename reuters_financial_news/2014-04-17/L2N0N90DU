NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - The markets have remained interesting this week as earnings season has ramped up, but the most interesting index remains the Nasdaq Composite.

The Nazz continues its upward swing following Tuesday's volatile, deep plunge; it has now gained more than three percent in the brief period between the lows it hit Tuesday and the Wednesday close.  That's a pretty short period of time to see such a dramatic move in the index but doesn't necessarily point to better tidings ahead. Bespoke Investment Group pointed out that when swings like this are usually seen - there have been 18 such occurrences since 2000 - it doesn't bode well for the tech-heavy index.  On average, the decline following all of these types of days like Tuesday - where the market opens at least 0.1 percent higher, drops as much as 1.5 percent and then finishes in positive territory - is 2.84 percent in the week that followed. That's not encouraging, but that's kind of the way things go when the market sees bouts of volatility like this.  Notably, most of these volatile sessions are clustered around bad market environments - it happened several times in 2000 and 2001 before abating, only to return in 2008; so rough markets are generally when this kind of thing occurs.  What's undetermined now is how well the markets overall will do in a rebound attempt and whether it's a Sisyphean pursuit at a time when many stocks are doomed for more pain.  Goldman Sachs doesn't entirely think so, believing some stocks have plenty of room for upside after the momentum-driven selloff took down a lot of stocks heavily. They finger Illumina, Biogen, TD Ameritrade - as among those that could see relief rallies due to the kitchen-sink approach to investing that has driven stocks up, then down, all at once of late. That may not translate to the entire market, though.  Google and IBM results were lousy, with the kind of problems that bode ill for the rest of the market and not just to company-specific issues.  Google saw a steep fall in mobile ad rates, while IBM blamed weak hardware sales for its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, as Reuters' Alexei Oreskovic and Noel Randewich wrote recently. [ID:nL2N0N82DZ] An 11-percent drop in emerging markets including China, Brazil, Russia and India was partially to blame and that's worrisome for tech names dependent on enterprise-spending, such as Oracle, Cisco, EMC and Hewlett-Packard.  Looking further, these reports, should they continue to disappoint, will take the market's renewed fervor and bury it.  Robert Sluymer of RBC Capital Markets believes that the current technicals suggest nothing more than a 'technical' rebound that fizzles within a few days time.  And Scott Fullman, senior managing director and chief strategist at Increasing Alpha, who studies options activity, notes that with options expiration coming today that there are currently about the same percentage of calls and puts that look set to expire worthless - about 28,400 calls and 28,200 puts that have no bid are expiring.  That means people are still collecting premiums, Fullman said, a sign they're not really to stop trading them even this late in the one month cycle that marks expiration; they're worried about volatility and using this to make a bit of money and also remain prepared against sudden market moves.
