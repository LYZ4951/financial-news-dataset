LONDON/NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street's biggest banks quarterly earnings offer a glimpse into the scale of their commodity trading activity through a measure of trading risk called VaR.

On Thursday Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> both reported an increase in commodity markets Value-at-Risk (VaR), as well as improving performance in the natural resources sector, which has come under pressure in recent years. Goldman increased its commodities VaR to $21 million in the first quarter, the highest in a year, and said that "significantly higher" commodities net revenue compared with early 2013 had offset lower returns in the rest of its Fixed Income and Commodities Client Execution business.  Morgan Stanley increased its VaR to an average of $20 million in the first quarter of this year from $18 million in the last three months of 2013, despite preparing to sell its merchant oil trading business to Russian energy major Rosneft. The bank reported an increase in Fixed Income and Commodities net revenue to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion due to a "strong performance in commodities and solid results in credit and securitized products", despite lower volumes across parts of the businesses. JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, the first to report last week, said on Friday its commodity markets VaR fell to its lowest in nine years in the first quarter of 2014 as it prepared to complete the sale of its physical commodities business. On March 19, it an announced a $3.5 billion deal to sell it to Swiss-based trading house Mercuria.
