NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Apr 16 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $6 billion to $1.045 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $17.4 billion to $1.066 trillion.
