BANGKOK, April 17 (Reuters) - Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) <SCB.BK>, Thailand's third-largest lender by assets, reported a higher-than-expect quarterly net profit on Thursday thanks to higher interest income and lower operating costs.

SCB made a net profit of 13.13 billion baht ($406 million) in the January-March quarter, barely changed from 13.12 billion a year earlier but up 11.7 percent from the previous quarter.  Analysts polled by Reuters had expected profit to fall 10 percent to around 12.3 billion baht.  SCB, which is 21.3 percent owned by the Thai royal family's investment arm, also said it was aiming for 5-6 percent loan growth this year, slower than last year's 12 percent.
