HANOI, April 17 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> climbed 1.05 percent to close at 580.31 points on Thursday as investors picked up cheap shares after recent falls.

"Given such sharp drop in the previous session while there was no bad news, some investors thought it was a good time to join the market," said analyst Nguyen Hoang Phuong at Ho Chi Minh City Securities. The index closed at a six-week low on Wednesday after having fallen for five straight sessions. [ID:nL3N0N826Y] Most stocks advanced, led by Vietnam's biggest listed firm PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, with a 1.66-percent advance. Food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> rose 1.06 percent and Ho Chi Minh City-based lender Sacombank <STB.HM> increased 2.11 percent. But low trading and expected weak buying demand at higher prices would prevent the index from strong gains, analysts said. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT).
