MUMBAI, April 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose more than 1.5 percent on Thursday to snap a three-day losing streak as lenders such as ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> surged on value buying and hopes of gains on bond portfolios after the central bank's biggest debt auction.

NSE Bank index <.NSEBANK> provisionally surged 1.8 percent, led by gains of 3.4 percent in ICICI Bank shares and 2.6 percent in Axis Bank Ltd <AXBK.NS>.
