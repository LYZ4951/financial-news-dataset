April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings (Thailand) Limited has  affirmed Noble Group Limited's <NOBG.SI> (Noble; BBB-/Stable) THB2.85bn guaranteed bonds  due 2016 at National Long-Term 'AAA(tha)'. The bonds, which are guaranteed by  Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF), have a Stable Outlook.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Guarantee from CGIF: The rating on the bonds reflects the unconditional and  irrevocable guarantee provided by CGIF for the bond's scheduled payments of  interest and principal. In Fitch's view CGIF's credit profile is stronger than  Thailand's Long-Term Local Currency Issuer Default Rating of 'A-', which is  equivalent to 'AAA(tha)' on the National Rating scale. The bonds are, therefore,  rated at 'AAA(tha)'.  Established as a trust fund of the Asian Development Bank [ADB.UL] (ADB) in November  2010, CGIF provides financial guarantee insurance to corporate bonds issued in  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), plus Japan, China and Korea,  to protect investors against default. CGIF's capital contributors include the  ASEAN members as well as the ADB, China, Japan and Korea. Risk from Bond Payment Acceleration: The bondholders' representative may demand  payment under the guarantee only if there is a non-payment event. The  bondholders' representative has the right to accelerate the bond payments  against the issuer if there is any event of default. However, if the  bondholders' representative exercises this right, CGIF will no longer be  obligated to make payments under the guarantee.  Currency Risk: Bondholders may not receive payment in Thai baht under the  guarantee, if CGIF determines that it is impossible or impracticable or that it  is unable on commercially reasonable terms and in accordance with its policy to  obtain Thai baht to fund the bond payment. In this event, CGIF may make the  payment with an equivalent amount of US dollars.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -  deterioration in CGIF's credit profile relative to Thailand's Long-Term Local  Currency IDR  Positive: No positive action is expected as the rating is at the highest end of  the National Ratings scale
