April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Proposed amendments to the legislative framework for  Dutch covered bonds would increase liquidity protection, Fitch Ratings says. The  proposals would also provide a legal backstop for minimum overcollateralisation  (OC) levels that would give additional protection for covered bond investors. If the provisions are enacted, we would not expect any ratings impact on the  Dutch covered bond programmes, which already feature liquidity provision in line  with our covered bond ratings criteria and OC commitments above the proposed  floor.  The consultation also considers removing the rating limit of 'AA-' for new  issuance, which has indirectly provided a minimum level of investor protection  with regard to liquidity and OC management. Removing the rating limit would  allow banks to issue new covered bonds from existing programmes even after  lowering OC commitments to levels that would lead to covered bond downgrades.  However, in practice, active issuers are likely to maintain rating and OC levels  to maintain their investor base.  The Dutch Ministry of Finance's consultation paper proposes that a covered bond  programme's liquid assets should cover interest obligations and other costs  (such as swap expenses) due in the next six months. All Dutch programmes  currently have a dynamic liquidity reserve fund in place covering interest  payments and senior costs due in the next three months, which is in line with  our criteria. The proposed requirement for six-month liquidity coverage would  lead to higher liquidity reserves, although it is not yet clear how the  liquidity requirement would be calculated.  Banks would also have to have enough liquidity to meet principal redemptions due  in the next 12 months where there is no maturity extension or where the bond is  extendible by less than 12 months. ABN Amro Bank N.V. [ABRGPA.UL] and ING Bank N.V.'s  programmes would be the only ones affected by this change, as they issue hard  bullet covered bonds. We take comfort from the high short-term ratings threshold  ('F1+') in place in these programmes' 12-month pre-maturity tests. Below this  threshold, liquid assets must be posted to meet redemptions in the following 12  months.  If the implementation of the proposal meant that this liquidity reserve would be  in place in all circumstances, even when the short-term rating is at or above  the threshold, this would provide even more protection for the covered bonds.  But the change is unlikely to affect the maximum uplift between the bank's  rating and the covered bond rating. The proposed minimum OC of 5% would be ratings neutral, as Fitch gives credit to  the public commitments of the issuers to maintain OC at higher levels of between  15% and 33%. All programmes also have a minimum contractual level, ranging from  3% to 15%.
