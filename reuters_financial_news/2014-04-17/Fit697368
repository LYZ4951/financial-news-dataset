April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Red & Black Auto  Lease Germany 1 S.A.'s notes as below:  EUR400m class A notes affirmed at 'AAAsf' with Stable Outlook The transaction is a securitisation of auto lease receivables originated by ALD  Auto Leasing D GmbH (ALD), which is wholly owned by Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> (SG;  A/Negative/F1).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the transaction's stable performance, which is in line  with Fitch's expectations. According to the investor report as of April 2014,  the observed cumulative default rate since closing in May 2013 is a low 0.33% of  the initial pool balance, including additionally purchased assets. The  cumulative loss rate for the same period is 0.21%.  The transaction features a one-year revolving period since closing. Thus, it  will continue replenishing until May 2014 unless early amortisation is triggered  following an early termination event. This is unlikely as neither of the early  amortisation triggers is close to being breached.  The rated notes benefit from credit enhancement consisting of  overcollateralisation through subordination (30%) and a non-amortising reserve  fund (1%). Additionally, the transaction benefits from substantial excess spread  that has been sufficient to cover the losses realised so far. To consider  potential pool deterioration over the revolving period, Fitch constructed a  worst-case portfolio subject to the replenishing criteria, which shows that the  notes are able to withstand the stress without its rating being affected.  The current pool as of April 2014 is comparable to the one at closing.  Currently, the total pool amount is EUR571.4m, which is spread over 38,802 lease  contracts. Of the balance, 81.2% are passenger car leases and 18.8% light  commercial vehicle leases. The pool is subject to lessee concentration, as the  largest lessee accounts for 2% of the total pool balance and the top 20 lessees  comprise about 14%.  In addition to the amortising lease component, the transaction also securitises  residual values (RV). Hence, the performance of the class A notes is dependent  on credit risk and RV risk of the underlying lease contracts. The current RV  share is 57.6% as of the April 2014 reporting date, which is just slightly below  the maximum RV of 58% that is allowed according to the replenishing criteria and  that Fitch assumed when constructing the worst-case portfolio at closing.  The transaction features diverse contingent reserves that will be funded in case  SG is downgraded below 'A'/'F1' or upon an insolvency of ALD.   RATING SENSITIVITES Fitch has maintained its base case assumptions set at the transaction closing  date.  Due to the material RV amount in the pool, the transaction performance is  primarily sensitive to the RVs and hence, to a potential deterioration of the  German used car market. Fitch expects continued growth for the German economy,  which will also be supportive for used car prices. German used car prices  bottomed out in 2009/2010.
