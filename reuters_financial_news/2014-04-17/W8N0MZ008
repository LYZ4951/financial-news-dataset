WARSAW, April 17 (Reuters) - Poland's biggest insurer PZU <PZU.WA> said on Thursday its planned takeovers of rival Baltic and Polish insurers will not affect the company's dividend policy.

"Taking into account our capital worth 12 billion zlotys ($3.95 billion) the amount of these transactions is not a sum that deprives us of our capital potential," PZU CEO Andrzej Klesyk told reporters.
