LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Agricultural trading house Louis Dreyfus Commodities has appointed Gert-Jan van den Akker as Head of Regions, company sources said on Thursday.

Van den Akker was previously executive vice president Asia Pacific at Cargill [CARG.UL] and its global leader for energy, transportation and metals. He joined Cargill in 1987 as a grain trader and was head of the ocean transport business from 2007 to 2011 in Geneva, before relocating to Singapore for the Asia Pacific role. In his new position, van den Akker will report directly to Louis Dreyfus Chief Executive Ciro Echesortu, and his main task will be to coordinate the firm's six regions, the sources said. Louis Dreyfus - the "D" of the so-called ABCD majors that along with Archer Daniels Midland <ADM.N>, Bunge <BG.N> and Cargill dominate the trade of agricultural products - splits its global operations into six regions. Van den Akker will assume the role on June 1, the sources added.
