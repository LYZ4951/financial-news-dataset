April 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Slower Chinese economic growth in the first quarter of  2014 is in line with our forecast that real GDP growth will slow to 7%-7.5% this  year, Fitch Ratings says. We expect a continued, policy-led slowdown aimed at  curbing economic imbalances and containing leverage in the financial system.  China's GDP grew 7.4% in 1Q14, the National Bureau of Statistics said on  Wednesday, down from 7.7% a year earlier and the lowest reading since Q312.  Quarter-on-quarter growth was 1.4%, down from 1.8% in 4Q13.  Whether China can adjust to less credit-intensive growth and avoid a sharp  slowdown that endangered financial or social stability is central to its credit  profile. The authorities' commitment to reform and rebalancing, subject to the  constraint of maintaining full employment, is therefore a key consideration in  our ratings analysis and underpins our economic forecasts. Our affirmation of  China's 'A+' sovereign rating with Stable Outlook earlier this month reflected  our view that the mainland economy can navigate a structural adjustment without  economic, financial, or political instability.   Recent announcements by China's leadership are consistent with a continuing  commitment to rebalancing. For example, while a small stimulus package was  announced at the beginning of April, Premier Li Keqiang said last week that  "short-term fluctuations in growth" would not prompt a major stimulus of the  kind launched in response to the global financial crisis in 2008-2009.  While GDP growth has been below the five-year average growth rate of 8.9% for  the past couple of years, it remains substantially above the 'A' category median  of 3.3%. Our belief that China can achieve a smooth deceleration is bolstered by  the effective macroeconomic policy leavers at the authorities' disposal, such as  the ability to steer credit conditions (for example by varying the speed of  aggregate financing growth via injections of excess bank reserves). Tighter  monetary conditions that allowed interbank funding costs to spike last year also  contributed to macro level policy tightening, although they were aimed primarily  at reducing risks to financial stability.  Furthermore, China's closed capital account and largely domestically funded  financial sector make China less vulnerable to a rapid withdrawal of external  funding than several other emerging markets.
