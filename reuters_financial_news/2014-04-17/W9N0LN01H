WELLINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - New Zealand consumer confidence rose in April as consumers, buoyed by a strongly growing economy, stayed positive in the face of rising interest rates, a survey showed on Thursday.

The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index was 134 from 132 in March, edging back up towards a seven-year high of 135.8 hit in January.
