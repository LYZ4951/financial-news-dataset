JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Reuters) - South African financial services group Alexander Forbes <AFPJ.J> said on Thursday it had received expressions of interest from several different parties interested in acquiring it.

The group, which has also been exploring an initial public offering, said in a regulatory filing that it would explore both options. [ID:nL6N0H12SD] Rand Merchant Bank, a unit of South Africa's FirstRand <FSRJ.J>, and Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE> have been hired to manage the initial public offering, CEO Edward Kieswetter told Reuters last September.  Alexander Forbes was taken private in 2007 by a group of private equity investors led by London-based Actis and South African firm Ethos in a 8.8 billion rand deal. Other investors in the Johannesburg-based company are Boston-based HabourVest Partners and two Canadian fund managers, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board and Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec.
