NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - General Electric Co <GE.N> reported a decline in quarterly net income on Thursday, hurt by lower revenue in its transportation business that sells locomotives, but the U.S. conglomerate's overall industrial profits rose by 12 percent.

First-quarter net earnings fell to $3 billion, or 30 cents per share, from $3.53 billion, or 34 cents per share, a year ago, when the company's results were boosted by its sale of NBCUniversal. On an adjusted basis, GE reported EPS of 33 cents a share, compared with a 32 cent estimate from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE shares rose 1 percent in premarket trading. The following is investor and analyst reaction:  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK, OWNS GE SHARES "Earnings at a penny above expectations is a positive, but it's not a major win here. It's not like we saw a lot of (overall) margin expansion. And the revenue just slightly missed expectations, but really just immaterially.  "The big story is the organic revenue growth. Organic revenue up 8 percent is a very good number. It really shows the return to an industrial emphasis is paying off, and where the company is focusing. "It bodes very well for the future of GE and industrial America in general. "You're always going to have a little bit of friction in terms of individual segments. "Oil & Gas and Aviation seem to be the strongest on the revenue side. "The healthcare industry in general is just going through such a transformation. It's not surprising to see some purchases being delayed.
