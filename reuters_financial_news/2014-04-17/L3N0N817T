HONG KONG, April 17 (Reuters) - China's decision to use its own currency to settle recently-approved trading across the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges is likely to become a promising channel to funnel yuan funds to the offshore pool.

The new scheme, under the tightly-controlled capital account, will supplement yuan accumulation in Hong Kong via trade settlement, which until now has primarily fuelled yuan deposits in the former British colony.   China's securities market regulator said last week it would allow cross-border stock investment between Shanghai and Hong Kong, a small step towards opening China's capital account and allowing Chinese individuals to buy equities overseas. Hong Kong investment in mainland stocks will be limited to an overall quota of 300 billion yuan and a daily quota of 13 billion yuan. While mainland investment in Hong Kong stocks will be limited to a 250 billion yuan overall quota and a 10.5 billion yuan daily quota. [ID:nL3N0N21SK] It is the the first time mainland individual investors will be allowed to invest in overseas securities markets with Chinese currency. The initial quotas are sizable compared to the existing channels that allow yuan funds to flow out of China under investment schemes, namely renminbi overseas direct investment (ODI) and renminbi qualified domestic institutional investor (RQDII). China completed 85.6 billion yuan ($13.76 billion) worth of yuan-denominated ODI over 2013, according to central bank figures, while not much progress has been reported on RQDII actvity since it was authorised last year. Though analysts are divided on which of the two markets is more attractive in terms of valuation, the Hong Kong market's superior liquidity and transparent regulation will no doubt appeal to investors. Mainland investors are profoundly underinvested in equities, and only 12 percent of the total financial assets of Chinese households is allocated to securities, compared to 44 percent in the U.S., said Nathan Chow, an analyst at DBS Bank. "The underinvestment in equities by Chinese households could largely be attributed to irregularities in the mainland markets. Issues such as insider-trading and opaque reporting practices have eroded retail investors' confidence," Chow said. Supplemented by this new scheme, the share of yuan deposits in Hong Kong's banking sector is set to rise faster as the yuan internationalisation process deepens, fuelling concerns among market players on the Hong Kong dollar's future. Hong Kong dollar's (HKD) liquidity has been declining at the expense of the "redback" yuan. The market share of HKD deposits in the city's banking system fell to around 49 percent in February from 53 percent four years ago when an offshore yuan market came into being. The yuan's share jumped to more than 12 percent from only 1 percent over the period. With Hong Kong increasingly linked to China and becoming the offshore yuan centre, speculation of a HKD re-peg to the yuan is likely to pick up again, said Liu Linan, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. "We, however, think it is more likely that with the buildup of RMB liquidity in Hong Kong and the increasing use of RMB as a trading and investment currency, HKD will gradually be replaced by RMB in the long term," Liu said.
