ACCRA, April 17 (Reuters) - Ghana's cedi is expected to extend losses and test new record lows against the dollar next week, with dealers saying the central bank's tighter monetary policy stance was not a lasting solution for the weak currency.

In east Africa, Uganda's shilling should receive support from inflows into its debt market at planned auctions next week.  GHANA Unmet dollar demand from importers is expected to keep Ghana's cedi volatile next week, analysts said, as pressure grows on the central bank to adopt more efficient policies to stabilise the currency. The cedi slumped nearly 20 percent against the dollar last year and has lost a further 17.8 percent since January, hitting a record 2.7800/dollar on Wednesday. <GHS=>. It traded at 2.7600 at 1355 GMT on Thursday.  Seeking to stem the cedi's slide, the Bank of Ghana tightened its foreign exchange rules and hiked reserve requirements for commercial banks, after adding two percentage points to its benchmark policy rate in February. Dealers and analysts said the persisting demand for dollars could send the USD/GHS rate through the 2.800 barrier next week. "The hike has helped slightly, however this may not last. So there is still the need for a solution that clears the unmet foreign exchange demand from the market," a treasury dealer at Barclays Bank Ghana said. The central bank is due to issue 400 million cedis worth of three-year government bonds on April 24 to partly roll over some of its debt and also finance infrastructure projects.  NIGERIA Nigeria's naira currency is seen trading within a narrow band on expectations of dollar flows from offshore investors buying local debt, and month-end dollar sales by oil companies. Nigeria, which has seen renewed interest in its debt since it overtook South Africa as the largest economy on the continent, is planning two debt auctions next week.   The local unit was trading at 162.25 to the dollar on the interbank market at 1249 GMT, nearly unchanged from its close on Wednesday. <NGN=> It firmed to around 160.90 to the dollar last week, but weakened gradually on importers taking advantage of a cheaper dollar to stock up. "We expect the naira to stay under a bit of selling pressure in anticipation of an increase in demand until about the last week of the month when dollar sales by the oil firms resumes," Citibank Nigerian unit wrote in its newsletter to clients on Thursday.KENYA The Kenyan shilling is expected to come under pressure next week as end of the month importer demand creeps in, but tight liquidity in the money market should offer some cushioning. At 1116 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 86.80/87.00 to the dollar <KES=>, compared with last Thursday's close of 86.35/55.  "We will be expecting some dollar demand when people come back from the Easter break. End-month demand will start building (but) there is a bit of tight liquidity, so the two will be battling it out," Eric Gathecha a trader at I&M Bank said. The shilling touched 87.00/87.10 on Tuesday, its weakest in more than three months, and traders said the currency was likely to weaken to that level after Easter, when banks close on Friday and Monday.  UGANDA The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> is forecast to find support from strong inflows from offshore investors buying up government debt and weak corporate demand for the dollar. At 0823 GMT, commercial banks quoted the local unit at 2,506/2,516 against the dollar, stronger than last Thursday close of 2,515/2,525.  "We had strong inflows into this week's auction and we're anticipating the same next week," said Benon Okwenje, a trader at Stanbic Bank. "The shilling's momentum going forward is definitely bent towards strengthening."  The Bank of Uganda is due to sell re-opened 3 and 10-year bonds totalling 170 billion Ugandan shillings ($68 million) on April 23.  TANZANIA The Tanzanian shilling is expected to weaken against the dollar in the days ahead, weighed down by growing demand for the U.S. currency from oil importers.Commercial banks in east Africa's second-biggest economy quoted the shilling at 1,636/1,641 to the dollar on Thursday, weaker than 1,633/1,638 a week ago.  "We still see pressure on the shilling," Hamisi Mwakibete, head of trading at Commercial Bank of Africa in Tanzania said.  "There is increasing demand for dollars, especially from the oil sector, amid deteriorating inflows. We are only receiving flows from the central bank, but the available demand outweighs supply by far."  Market participants said they expect the shilling to trade in the 1,630-1,640 range over the coming days.  ZAMBIA The kwacha <ZMW=> is likely to come under pressure next week after tax payments, which bring in dollars, ended this week. "The kwacha is likely to be under pressure unless dollar supply improves," one commercial bank trader said.
