MANILA, July 1 (Reuters) - Philippine annual inflation may have quickened to its fastest pace in more than two and a half years in June, a Reuters poll showed, reflecting rising rice and vegetable costs, and higher transport fares and school fees.

The median forecast in a poll of 11 economists showed that the consumer price index likely rose 4.6 percent in June from a year earlier, the third straight month of increases, and the highest since November 2011. The central bank, which has a 3-5 percent target band for 2014, gave a 4.1-5.0 percent estimate for June inflation.[ID:nL4N0P903Y] On Thursday, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said the central bank was ready to undertake policy actions, if needed, to curb price pressures and manage inflation expectations.
