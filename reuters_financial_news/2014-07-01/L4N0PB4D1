SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - Sydney stocks turned higher after an early slide on Tuesday, as  resources shares rose after upbeat manufacturing surveys from China suggested that Australia's largest export market is regaining its footing after a loss of momentum at the start of the year.

China's official Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 51 in June from May's 50.8, the National Bureau of Statistics said. A separate private survey by HSBC also PMI showed expansion for the first time in six months, signs of an improving outlook for Asia's economic powerhouse.

Among the 'Big Four' banks, Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> slipped 0.1 percent, and National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> was down 0.2 percent.
