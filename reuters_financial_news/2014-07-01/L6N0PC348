KAMPALA, July 1 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> weakened on Tuesday after demand for dollars on the interbank market rose, with traders saying some foreign-owned lenders may be preparing to pay their shareholders abroad a dividend.

At 0951 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,605/2,615, slightly down from Monday's close of 2,595/2,605. "There has been demand in the interbank but most of it was coming in from offshore banking players," said Ali Abbas, trader at Crane Bank. "Some of the foreign-owned banks could also be buying dollars because they are preparing to pay their half-year dividends," Abbas said.
