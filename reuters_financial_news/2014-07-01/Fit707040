July 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says BNP Paribas's <BNPP.PA> settlement with US  authorities has no immediate effect on the bank's ratings (A+/Stable/a+). The  settlement includes the payment of a USD9bn fine and a guilty plea by the parent  bank. Under the terms of the settlement, BNP Paribas will not be able to clear  USD transactions related to the bank's oil and gas commodity finance business in  certain locations throughout 2015.  We consider the settlement a setback for the group, but we do not expect its  franchise to suffer lasting damage as a result of it. After netting legal  provisions of USD1.1bn, the additional USD7.9bn charge for the fine will result  in a 2Q14 pre-tax loss for the bank. Nevertheless, according to BNP Paribas, its  fully-applied Basel III common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio remained at around 10%  at end-June 2014, which Fitch considers to be in line with the bank's ratings.  BNP Paribas's ability to absorb the fine highlights the benefits of the bank's  robust earnings generation from diversified businesses, which underpins its  Viability Rating of 'a+'. BNP Paribas announced that the underlying net  performance in 2Q14 was solid. The bank's CET1 ratio also benefited from a  reduction in cash dividend accruals in the quarter to EUR1.50 per share from  EUR2.00. We do not expect the guilty plea to result in licence withdrawals, based on  comments made by the French banking supervisor, the Autorite de Controle  Prudentiel. According to the bank, this has also been confirmed by the US  Federal Reserve (Fed) and the New York State Department of Financial Services  (DFS).  The bank has accepted a temporary suspension of clearing USD payments for oil  and gas- related transactions originated in certain of its French, Swiss,  Italian and Singaporean offices. In addition, the bank will prohibit all USD  clearing as a correspondent bank for unaffiliated third-party banks in New York  and London for two years. The timing of these restrictions should give the bank time to put in place  alternative arrangements. We expect the bank to enter into a commercial  agreement with a third-party US bank for the USD clearing of these transactions  and believe that this should not result in a material curtailment or disruption  of its operations or in a franchise loss in its trade finance business. BNP  Paribas's oil and gas, energy and commodities financing business generated a  moderate 1% of the bank's 2013 net revenue. BNP Paribas has a strong franchise in international trade finance, where  transactions are primarily USD-denominated. Nevertheless, the bank's overall USD  funding requirements are moderate, and it does not rely on short-term USD  wholesale funding. The bank maintains sizeable liquidity reserves. At end-March  2014, the bank had EUR100bn in excess stable funding, of which around half was  in USD, and according to the bank the amount of excess funding was largely  unchanged at end-June 2014. Although we do not expect a material franchise loss, customer reactions to the  guilty plea are difficult to predict. We would consider reviewing and  potentially downgrading BNP Paribas's ratings if it suffers a material franchise  loss as a result of the settlement, which we currently do not expect, or if the  bank is unable to maintain capitalisation in line with peers.
