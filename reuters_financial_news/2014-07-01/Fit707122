July 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The increasing use of reverse transfer agreements  could strengthen the demand and enrolment profiles of some colleges and  universities and improve their results against performance funding standards,  Fitch ratings says. Funding risks due to uncertainty regarding performance measures, which vary  widely across the country, are significant for many colleges. Reverse transfer  agreements allow students who transfer from a two-year college to a four-year  university to finish an associate's degree with credits earned from the  four-year university. Senator Kay Hagan (D-NC) introduced a bill last month that  would provide grant funding to states to expand these programs. With this initiative, community colleges could improve their performance metrics  by awarding more degrees. Now, all institutions do not get credit when a student  transfers successfully to a four-year school before earning a degree. This may  be a large untapped market, as almost two thirds of community college students  transferring to four-year colleges do so before earning an associate's degree,  according to an April 2014 study by the Community College Research Center at  Teachers College, Columbia University.  Four-year institutions may also benefit from more robust enrollment pipelines.  These programs could encourage more students to transfer to a university before  earning an associate's degree and could strengthen universities' ties with  community colleges. Earning the associate's degree post-transfer may also  increase the likelihood of student retention and graduation. However, clear  evidence of this is not yet available. In Fitch's view, this benefit could be  offset if it also means some students, having completed their associate's  degrees, are more likely to leave for employment opportunities before completing  their bachelor's degrees.
