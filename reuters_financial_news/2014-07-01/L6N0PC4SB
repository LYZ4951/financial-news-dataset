MOSCOW, July 1 (Reuters) - The target price for a planned sale of the Russian central bank's stake in the Moscow Exchange bourse <MOEX.MM> is around 60 roubles per share, a financial source told Reuters.

Earlier on Tuesday, Russia's central bank said it had taken a decision to sell ordinary shares it held in the Moscow Exchange in order to fulfil a federal law from 2013.
