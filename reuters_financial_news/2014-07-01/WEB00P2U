FRANKFURT, July 1 (Reuters) - German cable operator Tele Columbus has picked Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and JP Morgan <JPM.N> to organise a stock market listing later this year, two people familiar with the plan said.

The group, which is owned by several hedge funds and credit funds following a financial restructuring, hopes to benefit from buoyant equity markets.  Telecolumbus would be the third German group which has recently emerged from a restructuring to list this year.   In the last couple of weeks, German car parts maker Stabilus <STAB.DE> and roofing company Braas Monier <BMSA.DE> listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, both after completing a revamp.  Tele Columbus and the banks declined to comment.Germany's third-largest cable company after Kabel Deutschland <KD8Gn.DE> and Unitymedia Kabel BW [LBTYAY.UL] last year posted 90 million euros ($123 million) in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) on sales of 224 million euros. Listed peers like Kabel Deutschland, Ziggo <ZIGGO.AS> and Numericable <NUME.PA> trade at an average of 10.8 times their expected annual EBITDA.
