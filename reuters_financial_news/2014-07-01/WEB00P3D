STOCKHOLM, July 1 (Reuters) - Swedish private equity firm EQT [EQT.UL] has picked Goldman Sachs and ABG Sundal Collier to lead a stock market listing of Norwegian sporting goods and outdoor equipment chain XXL planned for this autumn, three people familiar with the matter said.

One of the people said Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX>, Sweden's Carnegie and Norwegian bank DNB <DNB.OL> will also act as bookrunners, whereas one said a listing could value XXL at 9-10 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.46-1.62 billion) including debt. EQT, which owns a 65 percent stake in fast-growing XXL, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.
