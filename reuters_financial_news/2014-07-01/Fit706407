July 1 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings is introducing monthly money market funds  (MMF) factsheet reports to provide investors with fund-specific portfolio  information, covering each fund's current and historical credit, liquidity and  market risk attributes. Link to factsheets home page:  https://www.fitchratings.com/web_content/pages/fam/mmf/fund-surveillance.htm The factsheets on each Fitch-rated fund are published monthly to inform  investors of MMFs' current profiles and relevant risk factors' evolution through  a consistent analytical spectrum. Fitch applies a homogeneous methodology across  funds to classifications, issuers, credit quality, instruments types and  indicator calculation. Underlying portfolio data is based on portfolio holding  reports received from fund administrators and managers as part of the agency's  process for rating money market funds.  Analytical metrics available in Fitch's MMF factsheets include  -- Indicators of portfolio's credit quality as measured by its allocation to  credit rating categories -- Portfolio liquidity and maturity ladder through available daily or weekly  liquidity and allocation to relevant maturity buckets -- Fund's sensitivity to interest rate and spread risks as measured by the  weighted-average maturity (WAM) and weighted-average life (WAL), respectively  -- Portfolio composition by asset type -- Evolution of the fund's total net assets and net yield The factsheets also provide information on the fund manager, and Fitch's rating  rationale. In addition, Fitch publishes every month the Money Market Fund Snapshot, a  comparative analysis of funds' metrics. Fitch's MMF factsheets are available free of charge on Fitch's web site directly  through the link provided above or through www.fitchratings.com >> Ratings and  Research >> Financial Institutions >> Fund & Asset Manager Ratings >> Money  Market Surveillance box on the right hand side column.
