VISBY (Sweden), July 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's Social Democrats want to raise taxes for banks if they win the September general elections, the party's economic spokeswoman said at an economic seminar on Tuesday.

"We want to raise taxes for banks," said Magdalena Andersson, adding they want to spend more on child care. Sweden holds general elections in September, and the centre-right government is trailing the Social Deomcratic-led opposition badly in the polls. Andersson is front-runner to become Minister of Finance should the opposition win the elections.
