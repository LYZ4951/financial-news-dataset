SEATTLE, July 1 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group <AAL.O> is close to finalizing an order for 200 CFM International engines, worth $2.6 billion at list prices, to equip 100 Airbus Group NV <AIR.PA> A320neo jetliners that the airline has on firm order, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The deal between the world's largest airline and CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Aviation <GE.N> and Safran SA <SAF.PA> of France, marks a loss for United Technologies Corp's <UTX.N> Pratt and Whitney unit, which makes the other engine offered on the A320neo.
