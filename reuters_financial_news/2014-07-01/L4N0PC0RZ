SEOUL, July 1 (Reuters) - South Korean shares slipped on Tuesday as profit taking by domestic institutional investors offset positive sentiment stemming from China's upbeat factory activity surveys.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.2 percent at 1,999.00 points, after falling to an intraday low of 1,987.89 at one point. Domestic institutional investors sold a net 122 billion won ($120.61 million) worth of KOSPI shares, snapping an eight-day buying streak.  Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> fell 0.9 percent, while automaker Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS> slipped 1.6 percent. The won <KRW=> held its ground against the dollar on caution over possible dollar-buying intervention by the South Korean foreign exchange authorities to stem the currency's strength. The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,011.7 versus the dollar at the end of onshore trade, compared with Monday's domestic close at 1,011.8.
