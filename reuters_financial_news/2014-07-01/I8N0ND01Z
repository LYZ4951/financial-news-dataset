MUMBAI, July 1 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose for a third straight session on Tuesday and were not far from a record high hit last month as automakers such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd <MRTI.NS> surged after stronger monthly sales, while strong foreign buying also underpinned sentiment.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.4 percent higher at 25,516.35 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended up 0.38 percent to 7,640.15 points.
