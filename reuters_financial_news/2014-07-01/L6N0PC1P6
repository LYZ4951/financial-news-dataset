LISBON, July 1 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> fell as much as 13 percent in early trading despite a short-selling ban on the stock and management's attempts to clarify comments made to investors on a conference call on Monday afternoon.

Both Portugal's CMVM and London's FCA market watchdogs imposed a short-selling ban on BES before markets opened on Tuesday morning after BES's shares fell more than 16 percent on Monday. Trading in BES's largest shareholder, Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESF.LS>, was also suspended.  Short selling essentially bets on a stock losing value and can cause shares to fall faster. After rising initially on Tuesday morning, BES shares fell more than 13 percent by 0734GMT, but recovered some ground and were 4 percent down by 0747. The fall came despite a short statement issued to investors at 0705 clarifying comments made on an eight-minute conference call on Monday afternoon, a call that was followed by a swift sell off.
