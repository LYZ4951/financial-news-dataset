PARIS, July 1 (Reuters) - Shares in Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> rose over 9 percent on  Tuesday after top shareholder Andrea Bonomi outbid French private equity firm Ardian and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International <0656.HK.> with an offer valuing it at 790 million euros ($1.1 billion).    Investindustrial, the private equity fund led by Italian tycoon Bonomi, said on Monday it offered 21 euros per share for the 64-year-old all-inclusive holiday pioneer, a 22 percent premium to the existing year-old 17.50 euro-a-share offer by the Franco-Chinese alliance.
