ZURICH, July 1 (Reuters) - Switzerland's financial regulator said on Tuesday it was investigating staff at BNP Paribas' <BNPP.PA> Swiss arm after the French bank admitted violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran, in part by using Geneva to conceal wrong-doing.

Berne-based regulator FINMA said the French lender used its Geneva arm to hide the fact it was transferring U.S. dollars and providing exchange transactions and letters of credit on behalf of clients in countries embargoed by the United States. FINMA said BNP's Geneva arm "seriously violated its duty to identify, limit and monitor the risks involved in making transactions with business partners in countries under U.S. sanctions," exposing itself to unduly high legal and reputational risks, and violating Swiss banking law.  "It (FINMA) will also continue probing the extent to which the board of directors, management and other BNP Suisse employees were involved in the misconduct," the Swiss regulator said in a statement, in which it also imposed a two-year ban on BNP's Swiss operations to conduct any business with sanctioned countries. FINMA ordered BNP's Swiss arm to hold an undisclosed amount of additional capital to cover operational risks. A spokeswoman for BNP in Switzerland, Marie-Helene Hancock, was not immediately available for comment.
