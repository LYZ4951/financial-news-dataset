LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymakers differed over the best level at which to set a cap on how much banks can lend relative to a home-buyers' income, a record of their June 17 discussion showed on Tuesday.

The record also revealed for the first time discussions between the BoE and Britain's finance ministry dating back to September 2011 over how to protect against the risk of a euro zone break-up. The BoE kept the discussions under wraps until now to avoid alarming markets, and latterly until relevant legislation to wind up banks without taxpayer aid had been put in place. Last week the BoE imposed its first limits on how much most people can borrow to buy a home on Thursday, in a bid to stem increasing levels of debt and rapidly rising house prices. The BoE's Financial Policy Committee said that from October, it would only allow 15 percent of new mortgages to be at multiples higher than 4.5 times a borrower's income, and that all lending would be subject to extra affordability checks. [ID:nL6N0P72HO] Tuesday's record of the meeting at which this was agreed showed that policymakers had also considered setting a lower ratio as the threshold, but allowing more mortgages above this level. "On balance, the Committee agreed that it would set the policy by restricting the flow of lending at very high LTIs," the central bank said. The committee agreed to monitor future housing developments and adjust the policy as necessary. BoE deputy governor Jon Cunliffe said in a newspaper interview published on Saturday that policymakers had initially had different views on how best to tackle risks posed by the housing market before reaching a consensus. [ID:nL6N0P85IZ] British house prices have risen by 10 percent over the past year and by almost twice that in London.  But the central bank has stressed it does not target house prices, and on Sunday senior BoE official Spencer Dale said it was not in the central bank's power to do so. Instead, he said the central bank should be judged on whether it was able to keep a lid on mortgage borrowing. [ID:nL6N0P90XF] The record showed that most policymakers agreed that a housing shortage was the main driver of house price rises, although one policymaker noted that big house price rises had taken place in countries without a housing shortage. BoE data on Monday showed that mortgage approvals were slowing even before the FPC imposed last week's measures, with the number of loans approved in May at an 11-month low. But economists are unsure whether this is a short-lived reaction to new affordability rules which took effect in April, or part of a longer-lasting slowdown.
