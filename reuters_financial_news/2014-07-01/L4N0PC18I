HANOI, July 1 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.4 percent at the break on Tuesday as investors bet on good business results in brokerages and several other blue chips companies, an analyst said.

"Tyre makers and securities firms are likely to report good corporate results in the second quarter," said analyst Le Dac An from Tan Viet Securities. Shares in brokerage companies Saigon Securities Incorp <SSI.HM> and Ho Chi Minh City Securities Corp <HCM.HM>, Vietnam's largest in term of market shares, both gained. SSI stocks rose 3.09 percent and HCM shares increased 1.12 percent.  The Southern Rubber Industry Joint Stock Co <CSM.HM>, one of the country's largest tyre makers, increased 2.15 percent by midday, having touched its highest intra-day level since April 14 of 43,000 dong ($2.02), Reuters data showed. The index could further gain to surpass its strong resistance level of 580 points, given solid funds extended in the afternoon session, An said.
