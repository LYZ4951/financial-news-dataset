July 1 (Reuters) - Oil-rig contractor Shelf Drilling <IPO-SHEL.L> will scrap its plan to list on the London Stock Exchange because of  insufficient interest, Britain's City A.M. reported on Tuesday citing sources.

City A.M., a free newspaper distributed in London's financial district, said the decision to cancel the IPO, which had planned to raise at least $500 million, was made late Tuesday.
