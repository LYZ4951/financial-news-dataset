LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Italian and Spanish bond yields dipped on Tuesday before euro zone manufacturing activity data expected to confirm the bloc's feeble economic growth, underlining the European Central Bank's ultra-easy monetary policy.

Weak inflation numbers on Monday only served to reinforce the ECB's unprecedented policy measures last month, though the fact it did not deteriorate from May's 0.5 percent reading gave the bank room to hold off on further steps at this week's meeting. Flash Markit manufacturing surveys just over a week ago showed the euro zone's private sector expansion unexpectedly slowed last month. The region's biggest economy, Germany, expanded robustly, although a little more slowly while France's private sector shrank at the fastest rate in four months. [ECONEZ] "The ECB will certainly take this data into account and EMU inflation remains at a very low level and this rather supports the dovish tone of the ECB in general but not changing their view for now," said Christian Lenk, a strategist at DZ Bank. "This should keep yields subdued but we don't expect much of a move before Thursday's ECB meeting and also the (U.S.) non-farm payrolls," Italian 10-year yields <IT10YT=TWEB> were last about 1 basis point lower at 3.67 percent with Spanish equivalents down a similar amount at 2.66 percent <ES10YT=TWEB>.  Yields on Portuguese bonds nudged higher, slightly extending Monday's rise on uncertainty about the country's biggest bank after Luxembourg's justice authorities launched a probe into three of its holding companies. The yields were last at 3.69 percent <PT10YT=TWEB>, having bounced off 2005 lows around 2.25 percent hit three weeks ago. Bond traders said the uncertainty over Banco Espirito Santo, which were down 6 percent after Monday's 10 percent slide, were prompting some investors to book profits in Portuguese government bonds after their recent sharp rally.FUTURES   CASH YIELD THREE MONTH EURO99.825 (unch ) -0.035 (-0.008) TWO-YEAR SCHATZ110.665 (+0.005)  0.033 (+0.002) 10-YEAR BUND   146.890 (-0.120)  1.263 (+0.012) 30-YEAR BUND 2.182 (+0.009) 2/10 YIELD CURVE SPREAD 1.230 (+0.009) 10/30 YIELD CURVE SPREAD0.919 (-0.003) 2-YR SWAP RATE (BID)0.308 (+0.003) 10-YR SWAP RATE (BID)   1.448 (+0.015) 30-YR SWAP RATE (BID)   2.175 (+0.015) 2/10 SWAP CURVE SPREAD  1.140 (+0.012) 10/30 SWAP CURVE SPREAD 0.728 (+0.000) 2- YR BUND/SWAP SPREAD  0.275 (+0.001) 10-YR BUND/SWAP SPREAD  0.185 (+0.004) BREAKEVEN RATE (OATei 07/20)2.040 (+0.026) 10-YR BUND/UST SPREAD   1.282 (+0.018) 10-YR BUND/OAT SPREAD   0.344 (-0.003) 10YR BUND/BONO SPREAD   1.408 (-0.008) 10-YR BUND/BTP SPREAD   1.481 (-0.001) 10-YR BUND/GGB SPREAD   3.767 (-0.025) 10-YR ITALIAN BTP FUTURE   126.120 (-0.060)   EURO  STERLING  DOLLAR OVERNIGHT LIBOR   0.28857   0.46625   0.09360 ONE-WEEK LIBOR0.03643   0.48000   0.12300 ONE-MONTH LIBOR   0.08500   0.49406   0.15520 THREE-MONTH LIBOR 0.17571   0.55250   0.23070 3/MTH LIBOR/OIS SPREAD11.97100 (-0.003)  11.10000 (-0.001)  13.97000 (+0.004) Current levels versus prior European close For relative performance tables see below ------------------------------------------------------------))  Keywords: MARKETS BONDS/EURO
