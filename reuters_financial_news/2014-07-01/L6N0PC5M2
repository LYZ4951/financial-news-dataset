ROME, July 1 (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> has repaid 3.1 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in state aid and an additional 329 million euros in interest, the Italian Treasury said on Tuesday, confirming plans announced by the bank a day earlier.

The payment follows successful completion of the bank's 5 billion euro capital increase last week.
