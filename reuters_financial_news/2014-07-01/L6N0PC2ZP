ST PETERSBURG, Russia, July 1 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is discussing a requirement that state companies would only be allowed to have accounts at banks with capital of over 16.5 billion roubles ($480 million), the bank's governor said on Tuesday.

Elvira Nabiullina told reporters on the sidelines of a central bank conference in St Petersburg that about 50 Russian banks would be able to meet this and other requirements being considered for state firms. She said the central bank was still discussing the requirements. The Russian newspaper Kommersant last week cited an unnamed source as saying the Finance Ministry was preparing legal amendments that would ban state and private companies deemed to be of strategic significance from having accounts at foreign-owned banks.
