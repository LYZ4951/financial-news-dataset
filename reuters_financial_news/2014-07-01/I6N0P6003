MILAN, July 1 (Reuters) - Italian pharmaceuticals company Rottapharm said on Tuesday it would offer 50 million shares, or 25 percent of its capital, in its initial public offering at a price of 7.25-9 euro per share.

The offer includes the option to sell an additional 10 million shares, it added.  The price range would value the company, controlled by Italy's Rovati family, at between 1.45-1.8 billion euros ($2-2.46 billion), Rottapharm said in a statement, adding that market regulator Consob had approved the firm's listing prospectus.
