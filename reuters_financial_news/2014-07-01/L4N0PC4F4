July 1 (Reuters) - Automakers reported a 1.2 percent rise in U.S. sales in June from a year earlier, with the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of sales reaching 16.98 million vehicles.

The annualized rate is followed by economists and calculated using seasonal factors supplied by the U.S. Commerce Department that account for sales from vehicles produced in North America or overseas.
