ST PETERSBURG, Russia, July 1 (Reuters) - Economic growth in Russia is too low and is putting the country in a difficult situation, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Tuesday.

"Even 1 percent is very little," Nabiullina said. "This means that the quality of our economic growth will only just be in positive territory." The central bank estimates gross domestic product growth at 0.4 percent this year.
