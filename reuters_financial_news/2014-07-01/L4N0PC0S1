BANGKOK, July 1 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets were broadly weaker on Tuesday, with shares of Singapore's property firms easing on weak industry data while Indonesian stocks retreated from a near two-week high on Monday after June inflation data.

Losses in Singapore were led by shares of Hongkong Land Holdings <HKLD.SI>, which dropped as much as 3.2 percent to the lowest in almost three months, the worst performers on the market while shares of CapitaLand <CATL.SI> shed nearly 1 percent. Data released early on Tuesday showed prices of Singapore's non-landed private residential properties in all market segments fell in the second quarter of 2014, marking the third straight quarterly decline.
