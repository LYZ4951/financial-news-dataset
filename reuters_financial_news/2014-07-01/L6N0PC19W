ST PETERSBURG, Russia, July 1 (Reuters) - Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Tuesday the rouble's long-term stability could be ensured only by curbing capital flight.

"The rouble's long-term stability is possible only by lowering the outflow of capital," Nabiullina told a central bank conference in St Petersburg.
