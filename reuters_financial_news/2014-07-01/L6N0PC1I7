LISBON, July 1 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank, Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> rose over 7 percent soon after the opening bell on Tuesday following a ban on naked short-selling of its shares, but later rolled back to gain just about 1 percent.

Shares in BES slumped 16.5 percent to an 11-month low on Monday after the bank failed to allay investor concern about the company's dealings with its founding family and its troubled Angolan operations.[ID:nL6N0PB4CB]
