NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed two securities fraud counts against Rengan Rajaratnam, the younger brother of Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, a surprise development in the federal criminal insider trading case.

Rajaratnam still faces a criminal count of conspiracy, but U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald at a hearing in Manhattan dismissed other counts related to alleged improper trading in technology company Clearwire Corp.
