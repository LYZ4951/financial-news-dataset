VIENNA, July 1 (Reuters) - Austria should rethink its plan to cancel 890 million euros ($1.21 billion) of subordinated debt issued by nationalised bank Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL] that was guaranteed by the province of Carinthia, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.

"While designed and intended as an isolated case, the prospective wipe-out risks calling into question similar guarantees issued by other sub-national bodies," the IMF said in a summary of its annual review of Austria's economy. Austria has defended the plan as a way to ensure investors - and not just taxpayers - help pay to wind down the bank it had to nationalise in 2009. [ID:nL5N0OY2FK]
