LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The price for the Amsterdam float of ING'S <ING.AS> insurance arm NN Group <NN_w.AS> is likely to price at 20 euros a share, three sources familiar with the deal said on Tuesday, valuing the firm at 1.54 billion.

Reuters reported on Monday that orders below 20 euros were likely to miss out. The original price range was set at 18.50-22 euros, later narrowed to 19.50-20.50 euros.  Earlier on Tuesday ING said it was raising the offer size to 77 million shares from 70 million in response to strong demand.
