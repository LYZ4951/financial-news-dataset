NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said it will hold a test run of Alibaba Group Holding's <IPO-ALIB.N> highly anticipated market debut, reflecting the securities industry's focus on risk controls after a raft of technical snafus in recent years.

NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc <ICE.N>, said in a note to traders on Tuesday it would allow firms to test their trading software ahead of the initial public offering of Alibaba on July 12 for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The Chinese e-commerce company's trading debut this summer could be the largest-ever technology IPO in the U.S., possibly eclipsing Facebook Inc's <FB.O> $15 billion share sale in May 2012. Facebook's trading debut on Nasdaq OMX Group's <NDAQ.O> exchange was plagued with software problems as massive volumes of orders came in, setting off a chain of events that market-making firms said cost them a combined $500 million.  Nasdaq, which was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the problems, said it would voluntarily compensate firms that had been harmed up to a total of $62 million. NYSE regularly conducts systems testing during the weekends but it was only last October, ahead of Twitter Inc's <TWTR.N> market debut, that it opened up for an IPO simulation requested by member firms, many of which participated in Facebook's IPO. [ID:nL1N0IG0BC] During the Twitter IPO simulation, NYSE was testing mainly for two things: To see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the IPO; and to make sure that once the IPO took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been executed.
