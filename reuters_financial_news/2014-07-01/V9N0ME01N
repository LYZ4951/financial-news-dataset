VIENNA, July 1 (Reuters) - The Bulgarian banking system is basically sound despite a run on two banks, an official from the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.

"These bank runs were triggered by text messages and were not related to underlying problems of the banking system, which is well capitalised and liquid. There has also been a loan from the European Union." Bas Bakker, the IMF mission chief to Austria, told reporters at a news conference on the IMF's annual review of the Austrian economy.
