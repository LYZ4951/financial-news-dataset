BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER GEORGE OSBORNE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: "Significant downside risks remain and some new risks have emerged, including an increase in geopolitical tensions, notably with the situation in Ukraine. In order to safe-guard the global recovery, policymakers must continue to build their economies' resilience by implementing much needed reforms, tackling underlying vulnerabilities and ongoing efforts to reduce public debt."ON GLOBAL MONETARY POLICY WORLDWIDE: "As part of the global recovery, policymakers should communicate their expectation of higher financial market volatility, which is currently below historical norms. This should help ensure a common understanding and a reflection in market prices."  ON EMERGING MARKETS: "The immediate priority for EMs is to address policy and institutional weaknesses where they exist and strengthen macroeconomic fundamentals. Strong macroeconomic policy frameworks and structural reforms can support sustainable growth and build resilience to economic shocks."
