FRANKFURT, April 12 (Reuters) - The current low interest rate environment, a slump in prices and tighter regulation could lead to consolidation among smaller reinsurance companies, the finance director of Munich Re <MUVGn.DE>, the world's biggest reinsurer, told a German daily.

"The pressure to merge tends to be rising," Joerg Schneider said in an interview published on Saturday by Boersen-Zeitung. "Perhaps there will be pressure to consolidate among the smaller companies," he said. "But among the larger re-insurers I do not expect mergers because these could entail a significant business loss," he added.  The pricing pressure in the reinsurance industry is a temporary development and demand will increase again markedly in the medium-term, he said, without being more specific about timeframe.
