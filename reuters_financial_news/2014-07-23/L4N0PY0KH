HONG KONG, July 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said on Wednesday it named Brett Krause to head its locally incorporated bank in China, adding to other recent hires as it rebuilds its leadership team in the country.

Krause, a 20-year banking veteran, was hired as president of JPMorgan Chase Bank (China) Company Limited, the New York-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. He joined JPMorgan in January and previously held leading roles at Citigroup <C.N>, including senior country officer in Vietnam. JPMorgan earlier in July said it had hired former UBS AG <UBSN.VX> banker David Li as the new head of overall China business, including investment banking. The bank's chief executive for China investment banking, Fang Fang, left the firm in March, amid a probe of JPMorgan hiring practices in Asia. [ID:nL4N0PL0RY]
