WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators adopted rules on Wednesday designed to curb the risk of investor runs on money market funds, capping the end of a years-long heated debate between regulators and the industry dating to the financial crisis.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the measure in a 3-2 vote, with Republican SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar dissenting and Democrat Kara Stein dissenting.
