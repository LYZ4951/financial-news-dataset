July 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

BBVA's <BBVA.MC> deal announced Tuesday to acquire Catalunya Banc [FROBNC.UL]  will strengthen the group's sound domestic franchise and increase its exposure  to the Spanish operating environment, raising the correlation with the Spanish  sovereign rating, Fitch Ratings says.  At one notch above the sovereign rating, BBVA's 'A-' rating, is likely to be  maintained since more than 50% of earnings are still expected to originate  outside Spain after the acquisition. The geographical diversification places the  group in a stronger position than pure domestic banks to absorb unexpected  credit shocks. We view the risks of the transaction as limited, particularly in  light of Spain's improved operating environment.  The transaction is likely to weaken BBVA's credit profile slightly, but the  overall impact should be manageable because Catalunya Banc is moderate in size,  at around 11% of group assets at end-2013 and the group's capital is sound at  10.8% at end-1Q14. BBVA's strong retail focus and proven track record in  integrating banks means it is well placed to manage execution risks. Additional  guarantees on non-credit risks as part of the deal, including insurance  agreement penalties and other potential litigation risks, provide BBVA with  additional risk protection. BBVA estimates a 55bp drop in its capital ratio. We expect its asset quality  indicators to deteriorate given Catalunya Banc's weak credit profile. But loan  reserve coverage levels are ample and are likely to be strengthened by  additional provisions. The improved operating outlook in Spain should support  the workout of problem loans.  The transaction gives BBVA the opportunity to enlarge its franchise and critical  mass in Spain, particularly in the relatively wealthy region of Catalonia. BBVA  expects to generate synergies in excess of EUR1.2bn in net present value terms  and Catalunya Banc should make positive contributions to group results from  2016.  The transaction, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is expected to  close by 1Q15. We will re-assess BBVA's risk profile once the acquisition is  completed and information made available.  The transaction is another milestone in the restructuring of Spain's banking  sector. Catalunya Banc is the last bank majority owned by the Fund for Orderly  Bank Restructuring (FROB) that was auctioned, following its nationalisation in  2011. Banco Mare Nostrum, which is still 65% state owned, plans to start its  privatisation process in 2015.
