LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank needs to increase its foreign exchange reserves before conditions would be suitable for a rate cut, and a cut is unlikely before presidential elections next year, one of the bank's deputy governors said on Wednesday.

"We have to build up our reserves quite a lot and that's happening right now," Kingsley Moghalu told Reuters and Reuters financial television in an interview in London, adding: "It's unlikely that the rate cuts will happen before elections early next year."
