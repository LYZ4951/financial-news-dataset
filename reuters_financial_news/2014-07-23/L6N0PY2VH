MADRID, July 23 (Reuters) - Spain's third-biggest lender Caixabank <CABK.MC> is on Friday expected to post a near 6 percent rise in second-quarter net interest income (NII) compared to the same quarter a year earlier, as banks' core business begins to recover more steadily.

NII, which reflects earnings from loans minus funding expenses, has begun to pick up this year as deposit costs fall in Spain and an economic turnaround improves after a deep recession.  Barcelona-based Caixabank was seen posting NII of 1.02 billion euros ($1.37 billion) for the April-June period, according to the averaged forecasts from eight analysts polled by Reuters. The bank, which recently appointed former financial director Gonzalo Gortazar as its new CEO, was also expected to report a 74 percent jump in net profit in the second quarter year-on-year to 127 million euros, the poll showed. Analysts' bottom line estimates varied widely, however, as some factored in a hit from a recent profit warning from Austria's Erste Bank, in which Caixabank has a stake of just over 9 percent. [ID:nL6N0PE52Q] Many also believe Spanish banks' gross revenues will dip compared to a year ago as income from trading bonds falls.
