DUBAI, July 23 (Reuters) - Dubai-based property developer Deyaar <DEYR.DU> said on Wednesday its second-quarter net profit more than doubled, buoyed by the launch of its hotel apartment project.

Deyaar made a quarterly consolidated net profit of 62.5 million dirhams ($17 million) compared with 27.3 million dirhams in the corresponding period in 2013. SICO Bahrain had estimated the company would make a first-quarter profit of 36.5 million dirhams.
