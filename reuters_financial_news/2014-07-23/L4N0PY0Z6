SEOUL, July 23 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> edged up slightly for a third day of gains on Wednesday but investors were cautious ahead of second-quarter growth estimates and new government measures to boost the economy to be announced on Thursday.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,023.7 at the end of its session, up 0.07 percent from Tuesday's close of 1,024.4. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.03 percent at 2,028.32 points. The KOSPI reached its year-to-date high of 2,035.24 before midday but reversed earlier gains as the session wore on in absence of major cues. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co <042660.KS> jumped 7.1 percent as foreign investors covered short positions. It led gains in the shipbuilding industry, which boosted the KOSPI by edging up 4.4 percent. Offshore investors bought a net 135 billion won ($131.89 million) worth of KOSPI shares, while institutions and retail investors sold a net 71 billion won ($69.36 million) and 58 billion won ($56.66 million), respectively. Data early on Thursday is expected to show South Korea's economy posted its weakest growth in more than a year in the June quarter, with a deadly ferry accident hitting consumption and offsetting a modest recovery in exports.
