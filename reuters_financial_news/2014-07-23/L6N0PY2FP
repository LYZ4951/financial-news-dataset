LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Nearly three quarters of the fund firms who applied to become  Alternative Investment Fund Managers by a July 22 deadline were approved, the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry said in a statement.

Of the 215 applications made by the deadline, 151 were approved. A further 558 fund firms had asked to register by the deadline, of which 487 had been. The new European regulatory regime for alternative investment managers was launched a year ago, and gave firms 12 months to apply for a licence that would enable them to sell their funds across the European Union.
