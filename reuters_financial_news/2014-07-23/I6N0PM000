MILAN, July 23 (Reuters) - The banks will not cover any shortfall in an expected capital increase at troubled Italian flagship carrier Alitalia, should the Italian post office decide not to subscribe the cash call, a top executive of Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> said on Wednesday.

"It is absolutely out of the question," Intesa Sanpaolo management board chairman Gian Maria Gros-Pietro said on the sidelines of a conference. Italy's biggest retail bank is a shareholder of Alitalia. Poste Italiane, the state-owned Italian postal services company, is Alitalia's second-biggest shareholder with nearly 20 percent.  On Tuesday sources said Poste Italiane would only invest more money in Alitalia if it avoided taking on the airline's past liabilities.
