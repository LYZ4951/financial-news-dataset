LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - UK investment management group Brewin Dolphin <BRW.L> said net new managed funds rose 2 percent to 29.3 billion pounds ($50.01 billion) in the June quarter as portfolio gains negated a net 400 million pounds of outflows.

Core fee and commission income of 67 million pounds was 5 percent higher than the same period last year, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The company said it continued to make progress against its strategic targets, with net external organic funds into its core discretionary service in line with its 5 percent annual target.
