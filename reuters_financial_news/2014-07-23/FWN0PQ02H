LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - British outsourcing group Capita <CPI.L> posted an 11 percent rise in first-half organic revenue, driven by the 1.3 billion pounds ($2.22 billion) of major contract wins it secured.

Capita, which runs services from the Ministry of Defence pension scheme to police radio systems, said on Wednesday pretax profits rose 16 percent to 238 million pounds.
