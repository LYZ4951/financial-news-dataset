MUMBAI, July 23 (Reuters) - India relaxed its limits for foreign investors in government debt by allowing $5 billion more in a sub-category while reducing the same amount from its long-term investor category, the Reserve Bank of India said on Wednesday.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will need to buy government bonds with a minimum three-year maturity while there will not be any lock-in period, the RBI said in a release.
