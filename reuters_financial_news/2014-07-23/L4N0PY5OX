July 23 (Reuters) - McGraw Hill Financial Inc <MHFI.N> said its Standard & Poor's rating unit may face civil charges by U.S. securities regulators over rating of six commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions in 2011.

McGraw Hill said it received a "Wells Notice" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging violations of federal securities laws by Standard & Poor's related to the ratings. [ID:nPn9tQMqV] A Wells notice is usually the last step in an SEC investigation before a civil enforcement action is filed, and gives a recipient one last chance to convince regulators not to file a lawsuit. S&P has been cooperating with the SEC, McGraw Hill said.
