BEIJING, July 23 (Reuters) - A growing number of Chinese cities are relaxing property controls to support a cooling house market and safeguard economic growth.

The unwinding of property controls is a turning point in China's housing policy, which has been steadily tightened by  since 2009 to calm frothy home prices. Many analysts now believe the slowing property market is the biggest risk to the world's second-largest economy. At least 10 regional governments, which earn a large chunk of their revenues by selling state land, have openly or quietly relaxed home purchase restrictions this year, according to data from CRIC, a unit of real estate services firm E-House China <EJ.N>. But 36 out of the 46 governments have not budged, with higher downpayment levels and limits on the number of homes that residents can buy still in place for the fifth year to temper house prices, CRIC said.   Below are the measures that have been taken to bolster the property market.  * HAIKOU CITY, HAINAN PROVINCE, JULY 23 People can buy more houses, regardless of how many they already own, or whether they are registered as residents.

The requirement for getting preferential mortgage rates from the government will be relaxed. Buyers now need to contribute to a social housing fund for just three consecutive months to qualify, down from six months previously. Maximum mortgage sizes will be raised to 300,000 yuan from 250,000 yuan for single-working parent families, and downpayment levels for first-home buyers will be cut to 20 percent, from 30 percent. Existing home owners can also buy a larger property using state loans, and those who want to buy public housing can enjoy a 50 percent discount on their borrowing rates. The city will also make it easier for home buyers to get a hukou -- China's registration system that ties residents to a city and which affects their access to public services such as education and pension plans.  Developers will also have easier access to sales revenues locked up as reserves and managed by the government.
