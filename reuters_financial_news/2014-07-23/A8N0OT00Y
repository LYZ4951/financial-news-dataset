ATHENS, July 23 (Reuters) - Greece's economy is expected to grow by 0.7 percent this year pulling itself out of a six-year recession, helped by higher tourism revenues and stronger household spending, the Athens-based IOBE think tank said on Wednesday.

IOBE had earlier predicted a small economic expansion for the year, without setting a forecast. Its new projections are broadly in line with estimates by the country's European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders who expect the 183-billion euro economy to grow by 0.6 percent in 2014.  "The IOBE now expects the Greek economy to grow by about 0.7 percent this year." Household consumption would grow by 1 percent this year mainly due to easing unemployment during Greece's high tourism season in the summer months.
