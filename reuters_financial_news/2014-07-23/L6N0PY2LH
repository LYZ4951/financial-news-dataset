LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - New British lender Metro Bank's chairman and founder Vernon Hill said he expects around 60 to 70 percent of the bank's total lending to be to business customers in the future.

U.S. entrepreneur Hill was speaking after Metro Bank said its total loan book had grown to 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion), with loans to businesses making up about half of that. "It can get to between 60 and 70 percent. The trend is we can get to that over time. There's so much demand for business banking and the big banks are shrinking out of the space," Hill told Reuters in an interview.
