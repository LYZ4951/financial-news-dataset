July 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Viability Ratings on banks in European developed markets (DM) have improved slightly since the start of 2014, indicating early signs of recovery in European banks' intrinsic creditworthiness, Fitch Ratings says.  DM European banks had the highest number of VR upgrades globally in 2Q14. There  were nine VR upgrades in the region in 2Q14 and eight upgrades in 1Q14, so banks  in DM Europe accounted for 40% of VR upgrades globally in 1H14. The region's VR  upgrades far outweighed VR downgrades. These positive trends are flowing through  to bank Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs). European emerging-market banks accounted  for 26% of global IDR upgrades, mostly VR driven, in 2Q14. The trends were partly due to improving macroeconomic conditions. For the first  time since 2009, no eurozone country is on Negative Outlook. Progress made in  banks' restructuring plans contributed to the stabilisation in the region.  But prospects for DM European banks' IDRs remain tough - around 44% of IDRs are  on Negative Outlook/Watch - largely but not exclusively due to our view that  implicit sovereign support for banks is being reduced. Our support review in  March had greater impact in DM Europe than in other regions because effective  bank resolution frameworks are more advanced there than in other parts of the  world apart from the US. In addition, a relatively high proportion of bank IDRs  in DM Europe (around 40%) factor in and are driven by support rather than  intrinsic financial strength. Around a third of DM Europe bank ratings are  driven by state support. This support is likely to decline substantially by  end-1H15.  Outside Europe, bank rating trends point to stable and marginally improving  expectations for DM banks. Outlook stability remains high in DM Americas and  Asia/Australasia. Global emerging-market bank rating stability fell in 2Q14 in  all areas except Asia; the proportion of Stable Outlooks has declined across all  emerging-market regions in the last four quarters.
