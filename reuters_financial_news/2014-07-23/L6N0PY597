LISBON, July 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs's <GS.N> 2.27 percent interest in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo<BES.LS> was acquired on behalf of clients, the U.S. investment bank said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.

"Goldman Sachs International has entered into positions in Banco Espirito (Santo) by virtue of its facilitation of client transactions," the bank said in an emailed statement.
