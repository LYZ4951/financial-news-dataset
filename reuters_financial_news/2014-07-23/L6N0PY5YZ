PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> was placed under formal investigation in France on Wednesday on suspicion that it helped wealthy French customers avoid tax authorities, a spokesman at the bank's French subsidiary said.

Three former and current executives with UBS' French subsidiary were also individually placed under investigation, the spokesman said. Last year, a French prosecutor put the UBS head office and its subsidiary in France under formal investigation on related charges of illegal sales practices and complicity in illegal sales practices, respectively.
