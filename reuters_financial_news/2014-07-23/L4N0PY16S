WELLINGTON, July 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank raised rates for a fourth consecutive review on Thursday, but said it would pause on further rises as inflation was moderate, with data to dictate the pace of future tightening.

The official cash rate was raised by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent, as expected, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand saying strong housing and building markets were boosting inflation pressures, and surging immigration was also stoking local demand. It said a pause in rate tightening was prudent as it assessed the impact of the rises to date, but the cash rate still needed to be raised to a more-neutral level. In June, the deputy Governor told Reuters a neutral level was in the range of 4.5 percent to 5 percent. Thirteen of 16 economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise, with a consensus view that the bank will halt until December before it resumes tightening. [NZ/POLL]   *************************************************************  KEY POINTS:- RBNZ says prudent to pause and assess effect of tightening - RBNZ says further rate rises needed to take cash rate to "more-neutral" level - RBNZ says timing, extent of rises dependent on impact of tightening on economy, strength of inflation - RBNZ says NZ dollar still high, unsustainable, with potential for significant fall - RBNZ says inflation moderate, strong growth absorbing spare capacity - RBNZ says fall in dairy and other commodity prices to reduce incomes - RBNZ says house price inflation moderating, wage inflation subdued - For the text of RBNZ statement click on [ID:nZZN008400]  COMMENTARY NICK TUFFLEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST ASB "The assessment of development is in line with what we expected, particularly the concerns expressed about the continued upward trend in the New Zealand dollar while commodity prices continue to fall quite noticeably. "The Reserve Bank was also reasonably upfront that it is going to pause, so they are being quite clear about what their intentions are.  "Our view remains unchanged, we think the Reserve Bank is on hold until December, and they will start raising rates again then, but at a far more gradual pace. We think a peak in rates at 4.5 percent in second half of next year is appropriate, which is lower than what the Reserve Bank's forecasts imply."  MARKET REACTION- The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> fell to a session low of $0.8623 from around $0.8700 before the rate decision, while interest rate futures <0#NBB:> rose.  LINKS:BACKGROUND   - The RBNZ started raising its official cash rate in March after being on hold at a record low at 2.5 percent for three years. - The RBNZ has said it sees the neutral level for the cash rate at between 4.5 to 5 percent.  - Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in the year to June 30, with a high New Zealand dollar dampening import costs, while domestic prices were relatively contained. - Recent data has shown modest growth in retail sales, house price growth slowing, a lift in building consents, business and consumer sentiment still positive but easing from multi-year highs, and migration gains at an 11-year high.  - The economy grew at an annual pace of 3.7 percent in the year to March 31. [NZ-ECI] <ECONNZ>  - The RBNZ imposed limits on low deposit home loans last October and has said they have been partly responsible for a slowdown in the housing market. However, it has also said it will consider lifting or reducing them until towards the end of the year.- The trade-weighted New Zealand dollar <=NZD>, the RBNZ's preferred currency measure, hit a life-time high in mid-July, but has eased since, although it remains nearly 1 percent above the RBNZ's June forecast. - NZ's key rate compares with Australia's 2.5 percent, 0-0.1 percent in Japan, 0.15 percent in the euro zone, and 0-0.25 percent in the United States.
