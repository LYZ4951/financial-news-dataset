DUBAI, July 23 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi banks may attract interest on Wednesday because of a stronger outlook for National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, while the Saudi Arabian market looks set to lose steam after jumping on news that it will open to direct foreign investment.

NBAD, the emirate's biggest bank, on Tuesday reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.42 billion dirhams ($387 million), up 17.5 percent over the prior-year period and exceeding analysts' average forecast of 1.30 billion dirhams. Just as importantly the bank, which had expressed concern about slowing profit growth for United Arab Emirates banks after its first-quarter earnings, on Tuesday raised its profit forecast for this year. Finance chief James Burdett said it now expected net profit growth of 8-10 percent this year compared with 6-8 percent expected previously. [ID:nL6N0PX30H] NBAD shares, last at 14.70 dirhams, face chart resistance on the July peak of 15.10 dirhams; any clean break would trigger a bullish right triangle pointing back up to near 17.00 dirhams in coming weeks. Abu Dhabi's First Gulf Bank <FGB.AD> matched analysts' expectations on Tuesday, reporting a second-quarter profit rise of 16 percent, while Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank <ADCB.AD> slightly beat expectations. [ID:nL6N0PX3IX] [ID:nL6N0PX2XJ] The Saudi market <.TASI> jumped 2.8 percent to a six-year high on Tuesday in response to news that the regulator planned to open it to direct foreign investment in the first half of next year. [ID:nL6N0PX0UX] The euphoria looks set to diminish on Wednesday, however; the regulator is expected to allow foreign money to enter only slowly, in order to avoid destabilising the market.  Also, in contrast to the UAE and Qatar when MSCI decided in mid-2013 to upgrade them to emerging market status, the Saudi market is not cheap at present; Capital Economics notes it is trading at about 19.3 times earnings, above a long-run average of below 17 times.
