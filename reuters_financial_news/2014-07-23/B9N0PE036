BEIJING, July 23 (Reuters) - China will continue to implement prudent monetary policy and maintain appropriate credit growth to help ease financing costs for domestic firms, Premier Li Keqiang told a regular cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

The government will increase the size of its re-lending programme to provide credit support for smaller firms and the farm sector, the meeting said.
