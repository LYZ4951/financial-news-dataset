MOSCOW, July 23 (Reuters) - The $100 billion claim brought by shareholders of defunct oil giant Yukos - a ruling on which is expected Monday - is the result of a decade-long battle over the assets of the company, which was owned by former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Here are some facts about the claim:

* It is the largest arbitration claim ever filed, according to lawyers. * The claim is against the Russian Federation. Launched in November 2004, it is being brought under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and says the Russian government expropriated GML's investment in Yukos Oil Company without paying any compensation. * It was made by two subsidiaries of Gibraltar-based GML - formerly Group Menatep through which Khodorkovsky controlled Yukos - and pension fund Veteran Petroleum. GML and Veteran  account for 70 percent of the shareholding of Yukos.  * The ECT is a treaty designed to enforce international law in energy investments and was designed to protect foreign investments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It dates back to the early 1990s, "at a time when the end of the Cold War offered an unprecedented opportunity to overcome previous economic divisions", according to its website.  For a link: http://www.encharter.org/index.php?id=1&L=0 * Russia signed the ECT in 1994 but did not ratify it. The country opted out of its signatory status in 2009 and its provisional membership in the Energy Charter expired that year. * A tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2009 ruled that Russia was bound by the ECT, despite having never ratified the document, GML said at the time.  * GML's original claim was for no less than $28 billion. The figure of $100 billion was the result of a valuation carried out by third party valuers, included in a final Merits Claim filed in September 2010, GML said. It was an estimate of what GML's interest in Yukos would have been worth.   * Khodorkovsky is no longer a shareholder in GML. After he was jailed, Khodorkovsky ceded his controlling interest in Menatep (now GML) to Russian-born Leonid Nevzlin, a business partner who had fled to Israel to avoid prosecution. * Any monies won will be shared according to the percentages of shareholdings among the shareholders in GML, the biggest of which is Nevzlin with around 70 percent. The other ultimate beneficial owners who own an equal stake each are Platon Lebedev, Mikhail Brudno, Vladimir Dubov and Vasilly Shaknovski. * Platon Lebedev, Khodorkovsky's business partner, was arrested in 2003 and charged with theft of state property. Lebedev had been Khodorkovsky's co-defendant in two trials that President Vladimir Putin's critics called part of a politically charged campaign of revenge. He was freed in January. [ID:nL5N0KY3D6]
