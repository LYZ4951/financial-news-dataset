MOSCOW, July 23 (Reuters) - The $100 billion claim brought by shareholders of defunct oil giant Yukos - a ruling on which is expected on Monday - is one of a number of battles being fought by investors around the world:

* There are around 55,000 named Yukos shareholders, some of which are funds representing a number of shareholders. * Yukos shareholders, via two Dutch foundations called Stichtings which were set up in 2005, are waiting for a decision on a multi-billion-dollar claim against the Russian Federation brought at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, on behalf of all Yukos shareholders.  * These foundations are run by former management and directors of Yukos including former Yukos Chief Financial Officer Bruce Misamore. A verdict is hoped for this year, Misamore has previously told Reuters.  * Yukos' application in the ECHR argued that Yukos was unlawfully deprived of its possessions by the imposition of bogus taxes and a sham auction of its main asset.  http://www.theyukoslibrary.com/en/jurisdictions/european-court-of-human-rights/yukos-v-russia/* An interim ruling by the ECHR in 2011 found partly in favour of the Russian Federation.  http://www.theyukoslibrary.com/en/jurisdictions/european-court-of-human-rights/ * Around $1.5 billion of cash has been accumulated following the sales of Yukos's international units, but the proceeds cannot be paid out to shareholders yet because of a battle with Rosneft and its subsidiaries over ownership of the assets in courts in the Netherlands, Misamore previously told Reuters.   * There was a further $2 billion-$2.5 billion in inter-company loans given to Yukos's Russian operating companies in 2004-5 to pay staff, maintain production and pay suppliers which have either been won from Rosneft and its subsidiaries or are awaiting collection, Misamore has previously said. * The action being brought in the ECHR is separate to that being brought by GML. Legally, Yukos Oil Company and GML had to pursue their cases separately.

Litigation is not a viable route for them as Moscow and Washington have not signed any investment treaty.
