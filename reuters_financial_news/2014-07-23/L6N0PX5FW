MADRID, July 23 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> is on Thursday expected to post second-quarter profit up nearly 9 percent compared to a year ago, as the lender's net income from lending improves and it emerges alongside peers from a deep financial crisis.

The country's fifth-biggest bank by market value is seen reporting net profit of 78.7 million euros ($105.95 million) for the period, according to the averaged forecasts of seven analysts polled by Reuters.  Spain's banks returned to profit in 2013 after a real estate market slump that roiled earnings, though the recovery still has some way to go as volumes of bad debts remains high and credit demand is weak. Alongside smaller peer Bankinter <BKT.MC>, Sabadell will be the first Spanish lender to report earnings for the March-June period, setting the tone for the rest of the sector. Analysts expected the bank to post better net interest income (NII), or earnings from loans minus funding costs, than in the first quarter, and 30 percent higher than in March-June of last year.  Falling deposit costs are helping the NII turnaround. Revenue at Sabadell was seen falling in the second quarter from a year ago, however, as the bank makes less money from trading bonds.
