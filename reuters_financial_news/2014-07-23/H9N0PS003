HONG KONG, July 23 (Reuters) - China shares finished little changed on Wednesday, a day when five companies began accepting subscriptions for initial public offerings (IPOs), diverting some funds from existing stocks.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended a choppy session up 0.1 percent at 2,078.49 points, its highest since June 16. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings inched up 0.2 percent to close at a more than three-month high. The ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC>, China's Nasdaq-like board for high-growth, mainly high-tech start-up firms, was hard hit by the IPO subscriptions, sinking 2.8 percent - its biggest one-day drop in over a month.  Brokerage firms outperformed after posting or flagging good first-half profits, driven by the resumption of IPOs and expansion into more areas of business. The two largest listed players - CITIC Securities <600030.SS> and Haitong Securities <600837.SS> climbed 1 and 2.3 percent, respectively.
