July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. equity mutual funds suffered a 12th consecutive week of outflows, the Investment Company Institute said Wednesday.

Overall stock funds saw outflows of $2.24 billion for the week ended July 16, with outflows from U.S. funds of $3.95 billion - continuing a pullback in allocation to U.S. equities that has persisted since April.  By contrast, funds that specialize in international equities remain loved, with inflows of $1.71 billion, ICI said. The U.S. mutual fund trade organization also showed inflows for equity hybrid and bond funds.  The enthusiasm for world equity funds remains strong, although world indexes have trailed the United States this year. The MSCI All-World Stock Index <.MIWD00000PUS> is up 5.7 percent this year, marking the third consecutive year of gains, but it trails the S&P 500's <.SPX> 7.4 percent rise on the year thus far. Total bond-fund inflows came to $2.47 billion, led by $1.97 billion in taxable bond flows, and municipal-bond funds reversed a week of outflows with inflows of $497 million.
