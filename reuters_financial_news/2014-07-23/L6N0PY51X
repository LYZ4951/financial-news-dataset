LISBON, July 23 (Reuters) - Portugal's third-largest listed bank BPI <BBPI.LS> posted on Wednesday a first-half net loss after a year-ago profit due to forced sovereign debt sales meant to comply with new European rules.

The bank said it lost a net 106.6 million euros ($143.5 million) in January-June 2014, while a year ago it had a profit of 59 million euros.
