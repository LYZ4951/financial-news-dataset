MADRID, July 23 (Reuters) - Spain's Bankinter <BKT.MC> is expected to post on Thursday a 27 percent rise in second-quarter net profit compared to a year ago, thanks to improving net lending income and tracking banking peers to emerge from a deep financial crisis.

The country's seventh-biggest bank by market value is seen reporting net profit of 65.7 million euros ($88.5 million) for the period, according to the averaged forecasts of seven analysts polled by Reuters.  Bankinter and peer Sabadell <SABE.MC> are the first two Spanish lenders to report earnings for the March-June period, setting the tone for the rest of the sector.
