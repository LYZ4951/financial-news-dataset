July 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of AMT  Management Limited's (AMT) senior secured debt facilities as follows: AUD300m Tranche A medium term notes due November 2020: affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook  Stable; and AUD225m Tranche B loan due July 2018: affirmed at 'A-'; Outlook Stable. The ratings reflect the importance of the Eastern Distributor ("ED") as a  critical element within the Sydney orbital road network, and by the expected  ability of the project to service debt comfortably even in conservative downside  scenarios. ED is a mature toll road with proven traffic, operated by Airport  Motorway Group (AMG) through a lengthy concession that extends to 2048. AMT, in  its capacity as responsible entity and trustee of the Airport Motorway Trust, is  the borrowing entity for AMG.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Toll revenue for the year to 30 June 2014 (FY14) was AUD105.3m, up 4.8% from the  prior year. The higher revenue was due to toll increases along with 2.3% growth  in average daily traffic, which was an increase on the prior two years when  traffic growth was below 1%. The prior two years' traffic was likely affected by  construction on other roads in the Sydney orbital network that connect to it  (including the M2 and M5 roads) and from slower economic growth in the overall  economy in 2013. The M2 expansion project is now complete and economic growth  has picked up in 2014, both of which should benefit ED traffic numbers. In  Fitch's adjusted based case, traffic growth is expected to continue at around 2%  over the medium-term. The volume risk attribute is assessed as "midrange".   AMT has continued to raise tolls at the maximum level allowed under the  concession agreement, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5%  since operations commenced. Previously, toll prices were escalated in increments  of AUD0.50, which resulted in flattening of demand growth following each  increase. In November 2013, however, tolling moved to quarterly increases  (facilitated by fully electronic tolling), eliminating that volatility. The  concession agreement allows toll increases of at least 1% per quarter, which is  notably above inflation expectations and may impact long -term volume growth if  AMT continues its strategy of maximising toll rate increases. Tolls currently  stand at AUD6.29 for cars (Class A) and AUD12.58 for other vehicles (Class B).   Price risk is assessed as "midrange". While typical of the Australian market, the bullet debt structure is a weaker  attribute compared to other Fitch-monitored toll roads globally. However, AMT  and its main sponsor, Transurban (whose financing arm is Transurban Finance  Company Pty Limited ('A-'/Stable)) have proven track records of refinancing debt  well in advance of maturity. The AUD295m of bank debt due to mature in July 2014  was refinanced more than six months in advance with a capital markets issue,  extending the tenor from three to seven years and lowering the cost of  borrowing. AMT also benefits from Transurban's strong global banking  relationships. Structural features include: medium-term interest rate hedging  requirements; a higher interest coverage cash lock-up than in the initial loan  package; and a major maintenance letter of credit. The debt structure attribute  is assessed as "midrange". AMT has a demonstrated ability to withstand downside events and maintain its  robust historical interest-only coverage ratio (ICR) above 2.0x. Coverage ratios  have declined somewhat as the cash flows from infrastructure bonds have run off,  but the minimum ICR in Fitch's Rating Case is still fairly strong at 1.86. The  Rating Case assumes, in particular, toll rate increases of 4% per year, long  term traffic growth of 1% resulting notably from adverse price elasticity, and  moderate stresses to operating, maintenance and interest costs. The Rating Case  concession life coverage ratio (CLCR) of 3.24 and average debt service coverage  ratio (DSCR), on a notional 25-year amortisation starting in 2014, of 3.09,  benefit from the lengthy concession period. The debt service risk attribute is  assessed as "stronger". The ED's major maintenance requirements are well managed by Transurban, with the  costs fully funded by cash flow from operations. Management does not expect to  develop ED above its current capacity of 77,000 vehicles per day, but plan to  continue maximising revenues from the existing traffic to meet debt service. The  infrastructure development and renewal attribute is assessed as "stronger".  RATING SENSITIVITIES
