SARAJEVO, July 23 (Reuters) - Bosnia is working on legislation to tackle the growing problem of non-performing loans, either through their sale or the creation of a so-called "bad bank" to ring-fence the toxic debt, central bank governor Kemal Kozaric said on Wednesday.

Kozaric told Reuters the finance ministry was working with banking agencies in Bosnia's two autonomous regions on laws "allowing the sale of bad debt or the creation of a bank for bad loans."
