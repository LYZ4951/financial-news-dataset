ATHENS, July 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved National Bank of Greece's (NBG) <NBGr.AT> restructuring plan, which includes reducing NBG's stake in Turkey's Finansbank <FINBN.IS>.

NBG was one of Greece's big four banks that were rescued with state aid during the country's debt crisis. The Commission then reviewed NBG's business plan to see if it was in line with EU state aid rules. "The measures already implemented and those envisaged in the future will enable the bank to fully restore its long-term viability, while limiting the distortions of competition brought about by the state aid granted," the Commission said on Wednesday. NBG, majority owned by Greece's bank rescue fund HFSF which was funded with 50 billion euros from the country's bailout, has begun to implement salary cuts, branch closures and other cost-cutting moves, including an early retirement plan. The restructuring plan also envisages NBG cutting its holding in its Turkish subsidiary Finansbank to strengthen its capital position. NBG has almost full control of Finansbank and will keep a majority stake.  Finansbank has been a steady cash cow for NBG. The Greek bank's first quarter profits were higher than expected, helped in part by Finansbank, which contributed 63 million euros or 35 percent of the group's net earnings.

It said NBG shareholders and subordinated debt holders had contributed significantly to reducing the amount of state capital aid that was injected, having taken part in capital raising by the bank.
