PARIS, June 28 (Reuters) - Jean-Laurent Bonnafe, Chief Executive Officer at BNP Paribas, said in a message to employees that the French bank will be heavily penalised by a U.S. probe into sanctions busting which should end "very soon", a French TV channel reported on Saturday

BNP Paribas declined to comment. "I want to say it clearly, we are going to be heavily sanctioned," iTele cites an internal message of Bonnafe, posted on June 27. "Malfunctions have occurred and mistakes were made. But this difficulty we are experiencing should not impact our roadmap". U.S. authorities are probing whether BNP Paribas evaded U.S. sanctions relating primarily to Sudan between 2002 and 2009, sources have said.
