MILAN, June 28 (Reuters) - Italy's UniCredit <CRDI.MI> has reached a deal with unions to cut 2,400 jobs, the sector's main union FABI said on Saturday, in the first stage of workforce reductions foreseen in the bank's 2013-18 restructuring plan.

In the plan announced in March, the country's biggest bank by assets said it aimed to cut around 8,500 jobs by 2018 - nearly 6 percent of its workforce - including more than 5,700 in Italy.
