NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - High-speed trading firm Virtu Financial Inc, which has been pursuing an initial public offering, has received a letter of inquiry from the New York attorney general amid a wider probe of the industry, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.

News of the request by the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman came amid heightened attention to high-frequency trading following the publication of author Michael Lewis' book "Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt" last month. Schneiderman's office had earlier sent subpoenas to more than half a dozen high-speed trading firms including Tower Research Capital LLC, Chopper Trading LLC and Jump Trading LLC, a person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.[ID:nL2N0N824C] Federal agencies including the Justice Department,  Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also said they had active probes into high-speed and automated trading.[ID:nL1N0MW0NA] Virtu's IPO, which was expected in April, was seeking to raise about $200 million to $250 million, valuing the firm at about $3 billion. Reuters reported earlier this month that Virtu delayed the launch of its IPO as it awaited regulatory approval, which was expected within days rather than weeks. A person familiar with the matter said on Thursday that Virtu has not set a date to go to market with the IPO at this time.[ID:nL3N0N94L5] Shares of KCG Holdings Inc <KCG.N>, a firm that engages in electronic market making practices similar to Virtu, are down 16.7 percent since the beginning of April.
