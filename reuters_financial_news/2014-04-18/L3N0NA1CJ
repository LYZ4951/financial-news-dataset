HANOI, April 18 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed 2.58 percent down on Friday at 565.33 points, its lowest level since Feb. 12, boosted by strong selling from major investors and more falls were expected next week as the market lacked supportive news, analysts said.

Most blue chips in Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange's VN30 Index -- which features on the top 30 best performing companies -- lost ground, led by real estate firms and banks. HAGL Co <HAG.HM> lost 2.23 percent, and Vingroup <VIC.HM> tumbled 2.26 percent to 65,000 dong ($3.08) per share, its lowest price in six months. Hanoi-based lender Vietcombank <VCB.HM> fell 1.7 percent and Vietinbank <CTG.HM> dropped 1.86 percent.  The trading volume staying low in the past two weeks showed that the market have been on its downtrend in the medium term, said Nguyen Tuan, Deputy Manager at An Binh Securities. About 117 million shares were traded on Friday, below the five-day average of 129 million.  "Big investors are selling after some blue chips reached their top prices," Tuan added. "The market is expected to dip further in the next several weeks." The index has lost nearly 5.2 percent this week. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT.)
