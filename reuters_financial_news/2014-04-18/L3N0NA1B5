HANOI, April 18 (Reuters) - Thai shares on Friday closed at their highest since late November on solid buying while Vietnam's benchmark tumbled to a nine-week low amid widespread selling.

Bangkok's SET Index <.SETI> edged up 0.03 percent to mark a third straight day of gains, led by telecom firm Advanced Info Service Pcl <ADVANC.BK> which rose 1.27 percent. "Decent foreign equity inflows may continue to support SET in the near term," KGI Securities said in a note to clients. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth 7.5 billion baht ($233.1 million) in the $386-billion market in seven consecutive trading sessions as of Friday <.VMSFN.BK> <TH/TRADING02>, Reuters data showed. But analysts expect the index to face some selling off around a resistance level of 1420. "Catalysts for possible near-term correction remain local institutional selling and the longer than expected drag from politics," KGI said. Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Composite Index <.KLSE> witnessed a second day of gains after hitting a three-week low on Wednesday. It edged up 0.12 percent to end at 1852.69. The Vietnamese index, however, plummeted 2.58 percent to its lowest level since Feb. 2 on widespread offloading of stocks amid strong selling on expectations of further losses. [ID:nL3N0NA1CJ] VN Index <.VNI> has dropped 5.16 percent this week, losing its title as Southeast Asia's best performer so far this year. Stock markets in Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines were closed for a holiday and will resume trading on Monday.
