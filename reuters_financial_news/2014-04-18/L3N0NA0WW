SEOUL, April 18 (Reuters) - Seoul shares rose on Friday to extend gains into a fifth week as improving confidence in the global economy and easing concerns about corporate earnings lifted investor appetite for risk.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> ended the session up 0.61 percent at 2,004.28 points, marking a 0.3 percent gain on the week. It was the fifth consecutive week of gains, the longest since late September last year.
