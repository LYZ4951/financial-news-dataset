MILAN, April 18 (Reuters) - The board of Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> approved increasing the size of a planned capital increase to 5 billion euros ($6.9 billion) from 3 billion euros to absorb any potential loss stemming from a European health check of lenders.

In a statement on Friday, the bank said the higher capital increase may also allow it to repay early 4.1 billion euros of state aid it received last year.
