DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A health check of euro zone lenders led by the European Central Bank is likely to trigger a round of mergers among mid-sized banks in Italy as well as massive disposals of bad loans, the head of Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> told Reuters TV on Thursday.

Carlo Messina, who took over as Chief Executive Officer in September, said larger Italian banks like Intesa Sanpaolo are in a better position to withstand the so-called Asset Quality Review (AQR), which he says will be a very tough exercise and not just for Italian banks.  Intesa Sanpaolo has a common equity ratio of 11.5 percent, among the best in Europe, said Messina. But some smaller local banks with a weaker capital base will have to either carry out cash calls or engage in consolidation. "They can do capital increases or probably it will also be possible to do some mergers among medium-sized banks in Italy," Messina said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
