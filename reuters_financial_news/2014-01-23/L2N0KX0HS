Jan 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on television on Thursday that government legal actions that the company settled for more than $13 billion were "unfair."

Dimon, speaking on CNBC in a prerecorded interview from Davos, Switzerland, said most of the government claims against the company were for dealings that had happened at companies before JPMorgan bought them in the financial crisis.
