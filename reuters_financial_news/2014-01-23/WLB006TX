DUBLIN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Irish house prices grew by 0.3 percent month-on-month in December, the slowest monthly rise since May last year when prices began to firmly stabilise after a property crash, the central statistics office said on Thursday.

Residential house prices, which have halved since 2008 in a crash that devastated the economy, stood 6.4 percent higher than a year ago. Prices in Dublin, which are 15.7 percent higher than a year ago, rose 1.3 percent on the month.
