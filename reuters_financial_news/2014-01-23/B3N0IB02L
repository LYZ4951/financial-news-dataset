BUDAPEST, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's government does not plan to buy Austrian lender Raiffeisen's <RBIV.VI> local unit "in the near future", Economy Minister Mihaly Varga said in a written response to a question from a lawmaker.

Central and eastern Europe's second-biggest lender, had said in November it was reviewing offers for the loss-making Hungarian business as it focuses on more promising markets in the region. However early this month it decided not to sell the unit for now.
