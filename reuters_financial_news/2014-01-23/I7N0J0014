ISTANBUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The Turkish central bank intervened directly in the forex market again by selling foreign exchange on Thursday, bankers told Reuters.

The lira weakened to around 2.2875 against the dollar after the central bank sold $200 million in a forex selling auction. It then firmed to 2.2750 at 1512 GMT after the central bank intervened after the auction.  Earlier in the day the lira touched a record low of 2.2975.
