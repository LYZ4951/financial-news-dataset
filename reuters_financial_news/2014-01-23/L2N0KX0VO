MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, has sold its stake in Europe's top aerospace group EADS, renamed last year as Airbus <AIR.PA>, the bank's Chairman Vladimir Dmitriev said in Davos, according to Russia's Interfax.

The bank has been gradually selling down its original 5.02 percent stake and in a July 26 filing in the Netherlands, where Airbus is registered, VEB reported a reduction in the stake to 2.88 percent.
