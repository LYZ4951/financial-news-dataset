NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp <S.N> said on Thursday that it expects to report a fourth-quarter charge of $165 million for severance and related items as it is cutting jobs to reduce its costs.

The No. 3 U.S. mobile operator, which is 80 percent owned by Japan's SoftBank Corp <9984.T>, said it also expects more material charges in future periods associated with a workforce reduction plan that will include management and non-management positions throughout the company.
