HANOI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.38 percent at the break on Thursday as blue chips rebounded slightly after a bout of selling, with more gains expected next month.

"The index gaining in low trading volume after Wednesday's loss showed that selling pressure is not strong," said deputy manager Nguyen Tuan at An Binh Securities. The index fell 1.4 percent on Wednesday, ending a 13-day winning streak, during which it scaled a four-year high.Market activities would be boosted on Friday when shares of BIDV, Vietnam's second-largest bank by assets, make a $2.5 billion debut on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Tuan said. [ID:nL3N0KU1FA] The index could rise further after Feb. 5 when the Lunar New Year holidays end as demand for Vietnamese equities was still very high, Tuan added. The market will be closed from Jan. 28. Shares of confectionery firm Kinh Do Corp <KDC.HM> jumped 5.56 percent and VietinBank <CTG.HM>, the country's largest partly private lender by assets, rose 2.4 percent.
