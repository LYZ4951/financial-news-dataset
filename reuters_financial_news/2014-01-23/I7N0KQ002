ISTANBUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira touched a new record low against the dollar on Thursday two days after the central bank left interest rates on hold and failed to meet market expectations for earlier and longer additional tightening.

Turkey's lira <TRYTOM=D3> weakened as fara as 2.2931 against the dollar from 2.2635 late on Wednesday. It bounced off its low to 2.2910 by 0911 GMT.
