STOCKHOLM, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Swedish industrial 3D printer maker Arcam <ARCM.ST> rises as much as 11 percent on Thursday, extending recent gains and marking a record high following a share split earlier in the week.

The rally began on Tuesday after the share split took effect, gaining momentum the following day when Arcam announced two orders, one from a Chinese implant manufacturer, and another from a U.S. aerospace customer.  As of 0943 GMT, Arcam is trading at 306 Swedish crowns, up 10.1 percent. They have risen around 30 percent over the past three days. Arcam targets the orthopaedic industry and the aerospace industry, with its printers making implants and aircraft parts from titanium. The company's shares have risen almost 600 percent in the past twelve months, outperforming U.S. sector peers 3D Systems <DDD.N>, Stratasys <SSYS.O> and ExOne <XONE.O>. Arcam currently has a market capitalization of 5.6 billion crowns, valuing it 260 times net earnings over the past twelve months.
