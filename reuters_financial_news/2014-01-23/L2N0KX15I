SAO PAULO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Commodities producers drove Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index lower on Thursday following weak manufacturing data from top trade partner China, though homebuilders lent support.

Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> erased the previous session's gains, while Chile's bourse <.IPSA> climbed for the second straight session. Activity in China's factory sector contracted in January for the first time in six months, a preliminary survey showed on Thursday. China is the No. 1 purchaser of Brazilian commodities exports such as iron-ore and soybeans, and changes in the outlook for Chinese economic growth tend to have a strong impact on some of the Bovespa's most heavily-weighted shares. [ID:nL3N0KX138] Brazil's Bovespa index <.BVSP> fell for the fifth session in six, losing 0.56 percent to 49,023.20.  State-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA <PETR4.SA>, known as Petrobras, fell 1.6 percent, contributing the most to the index's losses, while iron-ore mining giant Vale SA <VALE5.SA>, which counts China as its biggest customer, dropped 1.1 percent. Homebuilders gained after data on Thursday showed inflation in Brazil rose less than expected in the month to mid-January. The data helped lead to a drop in yields on Brazilian interest rate futures <0#2DIJ:>, suggesting financing conditions for home loans could ease. [ID:nL3N0KX3FJ] Shares of builder Rossi Residencial SA <RSID3.SA> rose 1.6 percent, while rival Cyrela Brazil Realty SA <CYRE3.SA> added 1.4 percent. Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> fell 0.66 percent to 41,786.15, a level it has not closed below in nearly two weeks. Shares of broadcaster Grupo Televisa <TLVACPO.MX> fell 2.5 percent, while bottling firm Femsa <FMSAUBD.MX> lost 1.7 percent. Chile's IPSA index <.IPSA> rose 0.21 percent to 3,707.72 as shares of Banco de Chile <CHI.SN> climbed 1 percent.  Latin America's key stock indexes at 1538 GMT:   Stock indexes Latestdaily %YTD %
