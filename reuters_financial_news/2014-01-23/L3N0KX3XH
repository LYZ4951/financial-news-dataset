BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group said on Thursday it would help fund a pharmaceutical information platform being developed by CITIC 21CN Co. <0241.HK>, a subsidiary of CITIC Group.

Alibaba Group and Yunfeng, a private equity firm founded by Alibaba Chairman Ma Yun, will subscribe for US$170 million of new shares in CITIC 21CN and take a 54.3 percent stake in the company.  The goal is to channel CITIC 21CN's vast pool of pharmaceutical product data into Alibaba's e-commerce, cloud computing and big data systems to win new business.  Alibaba's business-to-consumer platform, Tmall.com, already hosts e-stores from more than 80 drugstore chains.
