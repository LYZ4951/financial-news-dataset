MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> said on Thursday that net profit in 2013 had tripled from a year earlier to 247.8 million euros ($1.36 million), above analyst expectations and helped by a series of acquisitions and trading gains.

Like peers in Spain, Sabadell's earnings were also boosted by lower provisions against losses on real estate assets, which had gutted earnings in 2012.
