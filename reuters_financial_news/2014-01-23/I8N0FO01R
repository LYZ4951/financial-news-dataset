MUMBAI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index hit a second consecutive record closing high on Thursday after Larsen & Toubro surged as its quarterly profit margins beat expectations, although falls in rate-sensitive auto makers prevented broader gains.

Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS> rose 2.7 percent after the company's third-quarter margins beat estimates, although Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd <MAHM.NS> fell 2.9 percent on lingering concerns about higher interest rates after the central bank on Tuesday recommended making taming high consumer inflation a priority. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed higher 0.21 percent at 21,383.01, a record closing high.
