SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Seoul shares pared their gains from the previous three sessions on Thursday, dragged lower by a soft China factory activity survey and weaker-than-expected earnings from Hyundai Motor, with Samsung Electronics next in line to announce earnings.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 1.2 percent at 1,947.59 points, giving up nearly all of the 1.3 percent gain from the previous three sessions. Foreigners net sold 159.6 billion Korean won ($149.5 million) worth of KOSPI shares while institutional investors unloaded a net 38.4 billion won worth, breaking a five-session net buying streak.  Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> on Thursday announced worse-than-expected October-December quarter earnings and fell 1.9 percent. [ID:nL3N0KV21L]
