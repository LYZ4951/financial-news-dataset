NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - One year after hiring a new chief executive to help it recover from a near brush with bankruptcy, E*Trade Financial Corp <ETFC.O> said it earned $57.9 million in the fourth quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss, as clients revved up trading while costs for bad loans fell.

The New York-based company on Thursday reported a profit of 20 cents a share, the most in seven quarters. Analysts, on average, estimated 19 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. E*Trade reported a loss of $186 million in the year-earlier quarter.   The company's attempt to sell mortgages and other credit products through its bank to offset volatile market revenue brought the firm close to collapse during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and required an infusion of more than $2.6 billion from hedge fund Citadel LLC. [ID:nHDW021952] In the fourth quarter, the company set aside a reserve of $17.3 million for loan losses, down from $74.4 million a year earlier and $37 million in the third quarter of 2013. Its loan portfolio fell about $2 billion from the year before to $8.6 billion. For all of 2013, E*Trade reported net income of $86.0 million, or 29 cents a share, after a 2012 loss of $112.58 million.
