OSLO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Norwegian savings bank Sparebanken Vest <SVEG.OL> will pay a dividend to its owners for 2013 despite issuing a profit warning on Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Frank Johannesen told Reuters.

"Our policy is to pay 50 to 80 percent of the owners' share of the result. As it looks now, it will be at the lower end of that range, at around 50 percent. But we've said that for a long time, as it's all about building up capital," he said. "As we see it now, even if we've got these additional losses in the fourth quarter, we're well in line with what we've previously said." The bank announced increased loan loss provisions amounting to 189 million Norwegian crowns ($30.69 million), much of it relating to the shipping sector. [ID:nL5N0KX0SZ] Sparebanken Vest's full 2013 earnings will be announced on Feb. 6. By the end of the third quarter, the company's accumulated net result for the year stood at 711 million crowns.
