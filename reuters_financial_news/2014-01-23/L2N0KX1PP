WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A Deutsche Boerse unit agreed to pay $152 million to settle allegations that it held some $2.8 billion in securities in the United States for the central bank of Iran, the U.S. Treasury said on Thursday.

The unit, Clearstream Banking of Luxembourg, had an account with a U.S. financial institution, which allowed Iran's central bank to hold an interest in 26 securities, and also offered it securities-related services. The Treasury did not name the U.S. financial institution involved.
