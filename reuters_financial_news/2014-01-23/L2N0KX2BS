NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Investors in funds based in the United States poured $4 billion into stock mutual funds in the week ended Jan. 22, marking the fifth straight week of new cash into the funds, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

Taxable bond funds attracted $3.1 billion in new cash, marking their third straight week of inflows. Funds that mainly hold U.S. Treasuries attracted $47 million in new cash, marking their first inflows since last November. Inflation-protected bond funds attracted a meager $21 million, still marking the first new demand for the funds since April of last year.
