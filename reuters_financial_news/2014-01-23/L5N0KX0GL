WARSAW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank will most likely start raising interest rates from their current all-time lows in the fourth quarter of 2014, with risks tilted towards an earlier timing, rate-setter Andrzej Bratkowski said.

"I still believe that the most likely timing in regard to the rate hike is the fourth quarter of this year," he told state news agency PAP.  "At the same time I strongly want to point out that the balance of risks shows that the hike might come rather sooner than later." He added that economic growth is likely to gradually accelerate to about an annual 3.0 percent in the second or the third quarter of 2014.
