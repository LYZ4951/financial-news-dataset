PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - European shares dipped early on Thursday, tracking losses in Asia after softer-than-expected Chinese manufacturing data fuelled concerns over the pace of growth in the world's second-biggest economy.

At 0812 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top  European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,345.86 points, hovering below a 5-1/2 year high hit earlier this week. The flash Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in January, from December's 50.5, suggesting that activity in China's factory sector contracted for the first time in six months. [ID:nL3N0KX138] French stocks bucked the trend however, with the CAC 40 <.FCHI> rising 0.1 percent, lifted by data showing French business activity shrank less than expected in January.
