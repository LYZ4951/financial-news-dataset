OSLO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Companies based in Norway's key west coast oil region are now predicting a slightly better business outlook than they did three months ago, a survey from Respons Analyse and Sparebanken Vest showed on Thursday.

An index measuring the current state of affairs rose to a reading of 62.8 in the first quarter from 61.7 in the fourth quarter of 2013, while another index, measuring future outlook, edged up to 64.3 from 63.8. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below that level signals contraction. The fourth-quarter readings were all-time lows for the survey, which has been compiled since the first quarter of 2012.
