NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Jan 22 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $17.1 billion to $1.019 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $13.1 billion to $1.042 trillion.
