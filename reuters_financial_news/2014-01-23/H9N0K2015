HONG KONG, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong posted their biggest loss in three weeks on Thursday, dented by a private preliminary survey that showed factory activity shrank in the world's second-largest economy in January.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> fell 1.5 percent to 22,733.9 points, its lowest close since Jan. 7. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong sank 2.1 percent, its biggest daily loss since Jan. 3.
