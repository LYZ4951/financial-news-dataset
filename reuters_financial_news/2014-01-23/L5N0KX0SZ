OSLO, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Increased loan loss provisions will hit the earnings of Sparebanken Vest <SVEG.OL> by 189 million crowns ($30.69 million), the Norwegian savings bank said on Thursday.

After conducting a review of its corporate portfolio, the bank will write down 110 million crowns tied to individual loans, mainly clients in the shipping sector. "In addition, for the fourth quarter of 2013 collective write-downs of 68 million will be recognised. Furthermore, net provisions and recoveries are done in the retail and corporate markets with a total negative effect of 11 million," it said. "It should be noted that the losses mentioned are provisions and not actual losses," the bank added. Last October, the then chief executive of Sparebanken Vest resigned over disagreements with the board. The nature of the conflict was not disclosed.
