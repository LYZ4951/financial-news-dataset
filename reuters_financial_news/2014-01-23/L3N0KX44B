MUMBAI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - India's central bank said on Thursday that rules for restructuring loans by non-banking financial companies will be the same as those of banks.

The key provisions include that the relaxation or extension of commencement of projects will not amount to restructuring for infrastructure, non-infrastructure and corporate real estate projects, the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement.
