LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulator has fined the UK arm of South Africa's Standard Bank Group <SBKJ.J> 7.6 million pounds ($12.6 million) for lax anti-money laundering controls of corporate customers linked to people holding prominent public functions.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Thursday it was the first time it had brought a case that focused on commercial banking.
