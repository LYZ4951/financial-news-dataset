DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Italy could raise between 8 and 10 billion euros ($10.94-13.68 billion) from the sale of stakes in state-owned companies in the next two years to ease pressure on its strained public finances, Economy Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni said on Thursday.

Saccomanni said the bulk of the revenue from the sale of stakes in companies ranging from the Poste Italiane postal service to air traffic control operator ENAV would come this year but the operation would not be completed until 2015. "We expect to have significant results in 2014 but the process will go into 2015," he said in an interview with Reuters Television on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum Meeting in Davos, adding that the estimate was a conservative one. He said one of the centrepieces of the privatisation programme, the planned sale of a 40 percent stake in Poste Italiane should raise 4-5 billion euros and further stakes could be sold subsequently. "After this initial offering there could be more," he said.
