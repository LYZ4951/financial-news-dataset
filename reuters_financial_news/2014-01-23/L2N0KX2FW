Jan 23 (Reuters) - Three Democratic members of the House of Representatives sent Target Corp <TGT.N> Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel a letter on Thursday requesting documents on a data breach that affected tens of millions of Target customers.

The request from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is in advance of a hearing scheduled for next month.  "This breach is particularly significant because of its unprecedented scope and scale," the Democrats, Henry Waxman, Diana DeGette and Jan Schakowsky, wrote in the letter.
