LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - Slovenia's prime minister said on Thursday there was no intention to borrow more on debt markets simply to take advantage of the kind of drop in interest rates grabbed by Greece and Portugal.

In an interview with Reuters Insider television during a trip to London, Alenka Bratusek who is currently fighting a leadership battle with her party's founder, said stability was what was needed most in Slovenia. The euro zone country only narrowly avoided needing an international bailout a few months ago and with its banks still facing problems and snap elections looming if she loses the leadership fight, Bratusek stressed caution. "This year we do not need an additional borrowing because any extra borrowing also entails certain costs," she said. A government collapse and early elections would slow efforts to improve Slovenia's economy and could hurt its sovereign bonds, whose yields <SI10YT=RR> have fallen back to their 2007 lows in the past month as investors have regained confidence. It has been a trend that has been seen throughout the euro zone's troubled countries and comes despite little or no improvement in actual debt levels.  EU figures released on Wednesday showed Slovenia overtook Greece last year as the euro zone member with the biggest fiscal deficit, at 14.7 percent of GDP. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Slovenia deficit vs EU: http://link.reuters.com/mym78v For full interview please click: http://reut.rs/1nqDygT ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  Bratusek has already said it would be difficult to stay on as prime minister if she lost Friday's leadership vote against the founder of her centre-left Positive Slovenia party and Ljubljana mayor Zoran Jankovic. "Stability in Slovenia is the most important issue... I have no doubts my party will do the steps that are proper and right for our country." On the country's current privatisation efforts, she confirmed there were 12 companies and one bank up for sale and said "several companies" had "expressed an interest" in what is seen as the jewel in the crown, Telekom Slovenia <TLSG.LJ>. Sources close to the deal told Reuters in December that Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE> and Telenor <TEL.OL> were among those interested. [ID:nL6N0MF231]
