MILAN, April 24 (Reuters) - Italy's Azimut <AZMT.MI> expect net inflows this year to be in line with 2013, the chief executive and chairman of the asset manager said on Thursday.

"Having raised 1.5 billion euros in the first quarter, it is reasonable to expect to get to around 3 billion euros (by the end of the year) like last year," Pietro Giuliani told Reuters. Azimut last year had net inflows of around 3.2 billion euros.
