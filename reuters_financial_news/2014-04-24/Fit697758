April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Australia-based Westpac Lenders Mortgage Insurance Limited's (WLMI) Insurer Financial Strength Rating (IFS) at 'AA-'. The Outlook is Stable.  Key Rating Drivers  The affirmation of WLMI's IFS rating and Stable Outlook reflects the company's  solid financial profile, which includes a robust standalone capital position and  conservative investment approach. WLMI's operating performance has been strong  as evidenced by historically low loss ratios, although absolute levels of profit  have fallen on lower levels of risk retention and net written premiums.  Actions taken over the last five years to reduce the level of risk retained  within WLMI remain in place. The risk profile of WLMI's insurance portfolio was  reduced following the decision to cease insuring mortgages with a loan/value  ratio (LVR) greater than 90% from June 2009, and from fiscal year 2012 (FY12)  the company's quota share reinsurance arrangements were expanded to include the  proportional cessation of 60% of all new risks. As a result of a reduced risk appetite and the run-off of higher LVR - and more  capital intensive - risks, the company continues to generate significant levels  of surplus capital. This has enabled the company to repatriate capital back to  its ultimate parent Westpac Banking Corporation <WBC.AX> ('WBC': IDR 'AA-'/Stable) in  excess of annual profits while retaining a strong stand alone capital position. In Fitch's opinion, WLMI would have sufficient capital to withstand a range of  severe downturn scenarios, although in the more severe scenarios WLMI would most  likely require recapitalisation to continue to operate within prudential  guidelines. In such a scenario, the agency believes WBC would be willing and  capable of providing such support.  Net profits after tax declined 36% to AUD42m in FY13 from FY12 as a result of  lower premium volumes and investment income. WLMI's investments were reduced by  26% to AUD450m following the AUD135m repatriation of capital. Moreover, net  earned premiums fell 21% to AUD68m and will continue to decline as the level of  prior period written premiums exceeds current levels.  The weaker economic environment in the state of Queensland and lower  underwriting standards of 2008 and 2009 continue to impact the claims expense,  and WLMI reported a loss ratio of 37% in FY13, which is above long run historic  levels. However, Fitch expects the tightening of underwriting standards adopted  from mid-2009, in addition to the current strength of the Australian housing  market, to support a stronger future claims experience.  Through holding a geographically diverse mortgage portfolio, WLMI's exposure to  any one state or region is reduced. Fitch considers this diversification to be  important given that periods of economic stress in Australia have historically  varied considerably at a state and regional level.   Rating Sensitivities  There is little prospect of WLMI's rating being upgraded as this would require  an uplift from the group rating which was affirmed in October 2013. The key rating driver that could lead to a downgrade is a deteriorating economic  environment that ultimately leads to a weakening of WLMI's capital position. In  the unlikely event that capital support is not forthcoming from WBC, WLMI may  find itself unable to meet high minimum regulatory capital requirements.
