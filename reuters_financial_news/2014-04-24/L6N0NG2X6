MILAN, April 24 (Reuters) - Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> said it sold all the shares remaining from a recent rights issue in trades on the Milan stock exchange.

Investors had subscribed to more than 99 percent of the shares in the bank's 1.5 billion euro ($2.1 billion) rights issue, which closed on April 17. The remaining shares were sold in the first two trading sessions after the subscription period closed, the bank said in a statement on Thursday. Banco Popolare was the first of eight Italian banks to tap the market for funds to boost its capital base ahead of a Europe-wide asset quality review. [ID:nL6N0N94QN]
