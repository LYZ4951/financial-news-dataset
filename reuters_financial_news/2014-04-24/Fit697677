April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings to PT Bank ICBC Indonesia's (AAA(ind)/Stable) proposed medium-term notes (MTNs) as follows:  - MTN with maturity of up to three years assigned National Long-Term Rating of  'AAA(idn)'; and  - MTN with maturity of 370 days assigned National Short-Term Rating of  'F1+(idn)'. The bond issue will be up to IDR500bn in size and the proceeds will be used to  support the company's business growth. This is Bank ICBC Indonesia's first MTN  issue.  'AAA' National Long-Term Ratings denote the highest rating assigned by Fitch on  its national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers  or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other  issuers or obligations in the same country. 'F1' National Short-Term Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The MTNs are rated at the same level as Bank ICBC Indonesia's National Long-Term  and Short-Term Ratings as they constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior  unsecured obligations of the company and rank equally with all other unsecured  and unsubordinated obligations.   Bank ICBC Indonesia's ratings reflect Fitch's expectation of strong support and  commitment from its majority shareholder, Industrial and Commercial Bank of  China Limited <601398.SS> (ICBC Ltd; A/Stable), if needed. These ratings also take into  account Bank ICBC Indonesia's strategic role in supporting ICBC Ltd's business  expansion, particularly in south-east Asia. In Fitch's view, Indonesia is one of  the important markets for ICBC Ltd's business growth in Asia. The expectation of  support is reinforced by ICBC Ltd's 98.61% ownership in Bank ICBC Indonesia,  name association and appointment of an ICBC Ltd executive as Bank ICBC  Indonesia's president commissioner.RATING SENSITIVITIES
