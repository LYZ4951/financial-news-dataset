April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects no significant breakdown in  credit discipline among U.S. speculative grade issuers despite current high  issuance volumes and diminishing returns, as discussed in Fitch's 'Annual  Manual' published today.  Fitch's 'Annual Manual' seeks to quantify and summarize the major factors  driving risk and opportunities for market participants in the leveraged finance  sector. The report combines analysis across Fitch's U.S. Corporates, Financial  Institution, Structured Credit, Fund and Asset Manager and Credit Market  Research groups.  Leverage among high yield issuers has risen slightly. Issuer operating  fundamentals have been modestly positive, offset by the moderate increases in  debt. Management teams continue to show discipline with respect to capex and  cost containment, reflecting their cautious outlook on economic prospects. Fitch  does not anticipate improvements in leverage from current levels.  Fitch notes the majority of the record level of high yield issuance continues to  be used to take out maturing loans and to refinance bonds. This activity has  generally been good for credit as it is solving the problems created in the last  upswing. Also, CLO issuance has surged, but net new issuance is more subdued as  outstanding CLOs go static.  Deal volume has picked up, but overall deal size is smaller compared to the  2006-2007 LBO boom. Fitch believes the size, volume, and quality of LBO  transactions are collectively less risky than the previous boom era vintage.  Even the large transactions like Heinz and Dell compare favorably with boom-era  deals in terms of the health of underlying business and degree of leverage.  Fitch expects fewer private equity 'club' deals, which will constrain the volume  of large transactions.
