BEIJING, April 24 (Reuters) - China shares slipped on Thursday as Shanghai free trade zone-linked companies faced more profit-taking following their strong gains earlier in the week, while rises in property stocks helped limit some of the decline.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.5 percent at 2,057.03 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> index of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings shed 0.2 percent. Shanghai free trade zone firms continued to pull back, with Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone Development Co Ltd <600648.SS> falling 3.8 percent and Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development Co Ltd <600663.SS> down 5 percent.
