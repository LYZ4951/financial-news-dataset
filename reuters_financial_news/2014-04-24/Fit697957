The certificates, which follow a sequential-pay  structure, represent the beneficial interest in a pool of four commercial  mortgage floating-rate loans backed by 82 properties.

Trust-level  leverage remains low with weighted average pooled Fitch's stressed LTV and DSCR  of 66.70% and 1.60x, respectively, compared to 69.90% and 1.44x at issuance.   All of the loans have additional debt in the form of mezzanine debt and/or a  B-note, with positions that are fully subordinate and subject to standard  inter-creditor agreements. The largest loan in the pool is the Eagle Hospitality Portfolio (52.5%), which  is collateralized by 13 full-service hotel properties located across nine states  and Puerto Rico.  The hotels are all flagged with national brands including  Embassy Suites, Marriot, Hilton, and Hyatt.  As of year-end (YE) December 2013  occupancy reported at 75.3%, average daily rate (ADR) at $134.24, and revenue  per available room (RevPAR) at $101.  This compares to YE December 2012 at 74.5%  occupancy, $130.09 ADR, and $96.90 RevPAR.
