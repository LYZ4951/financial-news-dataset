MADRID, April 24 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> on Thursday said its first quarter net profit had jumped 59 percent from a year earlier, helped by growing net lending income and after integrating several acquisitions.

The bank, Spain's sixth biggest by market value, missed analysts' averaged forecasts for an 83.2 million euro ($115) million) net income, posting an 81.2-million-euro profit.  But net interest income, or earnings on loans minus funding costs, beat expectations, rising 17.5 percent from the first quarter of 2013 to 530 million euros. [ID:nL6N0NF2Z2]
