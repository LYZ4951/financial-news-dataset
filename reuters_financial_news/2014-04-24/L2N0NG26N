BOSTON, April 24 (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis on Thursday backed auction house Sotheby's <BID.N> board nominees in a proxy fight with activist shareholder Daniel Loeb's Third Point.

Glass Lewis said that Sotheby's has been responsive to shareholder concerns: "In this case, we believe the Dissident has identified certain areas of concern, but ultimately has fallen short of making a compelling case that additional changes in the boardroom are warranted at this time beyond those already implemented by the Company."
