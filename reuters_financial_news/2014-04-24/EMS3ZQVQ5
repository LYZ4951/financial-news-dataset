NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Apr 23 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $1.7 billion to $1.043 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $10.8 billion to $1.077 trillion.
