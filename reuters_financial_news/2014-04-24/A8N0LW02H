ATHENS, April 24 (Reuters) - Eurobank <EURBr.AT>, Greece's third-largest lender, on Thursday set the price range for its 2.86 billion euro share offering, called to plug a capital hole, at 0.30 to 0.33 euro per share.

The bank, 95-percent-owned by the country's bank bailout fund (HFSF), is the third Greek lender to tap international markets after peers Alpha Bank <ACBr.AT> and Piraeus <BOPr.AT> which already raised 2.95 billion euros between them.
