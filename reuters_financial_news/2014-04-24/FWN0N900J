LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc <BARC.L> said its investment bank had seen a "significant" fall in income in its key fixed income business in the first quarter, continuing a slump seen across the industry last year.

Barclays said it will report a "small reduction" in adjusted pretax profit for the first quarter compared to a year ago, as improvements in costs partially offsets the drop in investment bank profits. Barclays will report its first quarter results on May 6.
