WELLINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank will raise its benchmark interest rate by another 75 basis points this year, but is likely to be more cautious next year, a Reuters poll has found after the bank delivered its second rate rise in six weeks on Thursday.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.00 percent, as expected, as it quickly followed up its March hike, which kicked off the tightening cycle after being on hold for three years. RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler repeated much of March's statement, saying the economy had considerable momentum from high commodity prices, strong housing and construction markets, and consumer activity, which were lifting inflation pressures. He reiterated the bank wants inflation anchored around 2 percent, the mid-point of its target band, and so will keep raising rates although the pace will depend on data and the exchange rate. [ID:nW9N0LN01J] Soft inflation data last week and a high New Zealand dollar have cast some doubt on how aggressive the RBNZ may be for the rest of the year, although a further rise in June looks almost certain. "For the RBNZ to pause in June there would need to be events that materially shift the RBNZ's inflation outlook down," said ASB Bank chief economist Nick Tuffley. "We continue to expect the RBNZ will pause for an extended period - until December -- after the next increase to assess the impact of the first few OCR increases." Sixteen of 17 analysts polled by Reuters soon after the decision saw rates rising by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent at June 12 policy review. The median forecast is for further rises in the third and fourth quarters, taking the cash rate to 3.75 percent by the end of the year. However, the RBNZ is seen more cautious in 2015 with only one 25 basis point hike seen in the first half of 2015. This is a Reuters poll of economists' expectations for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) monetary policy statement on June 12. ---------------------------------------------------------------  RBNZ monetary policy statement, June 12, 9 am (2100 GMT) NEXT MOVE   JUNE RISK (%)   SEPT  DEC   MARCH JUNEbps   +25  N/C  -25ANZ(June +25)   90   100   3.25  3.50  3.75  3.75  ASB(June +25)   66   340   3.25  3.50  3.75  4.00  BNZ(June +25)   85   150   3.50  4.00  4.25  4.50  Citi   (June +25)   85   150   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  Deutsche   (June +25)   9541   3.25  3.50  3.75  4.00  First NZ   (June +25)   70   300   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  Goldman(June +25)   70   300   3.25  3.25  3.50  3.75  HSBC   (June +25)   80   200   3.25  3.50  3.75  4.00  IFR Markets(June +25)   85   141   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.00  Infometrics(June +25)N/A   3.75  4.00  4.00   N/A  JP Morgan  (July +25)   40   600   3.25  3.50  3.75  4.00  Moody's(June +25)   75   241   3.25  3.50  3.50  3.75  NZIER  (June +25)   9550   3.75  4.00  4.00  3.75  RBC(June +25)   9055   3.50  3.50  3.75  4.00  TD Secs(June +25)   85   150   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.25  UBS(June +25)   90   100   3.75  4.00  4.25  4.50  Westpac(June +25)   85   150   3.50  3.75  4.00  4.00
