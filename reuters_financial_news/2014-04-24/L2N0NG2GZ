NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based funds committed $2.6 billion to stock funds in the week ended Apr. 23, reversing outflows over the prior week, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

Stock mutual funds attracted $3.1 billion in new cash, while stock exchange-traded funds posted $471 million in outflows. ETFs are thought to represent the institutional investor, while mutual funds are commonly purchased by retail investors. Emerging markets stock funds attracted about $456 million in new cash, marking their fifth straight week of inflows. Emerging markets debt funds, however, posted over $79 million in outflows, marking their first withdrawals in four weeks. Taxable bond funds attracted $2.9 billion in new cash, marking their seventh straight week of inflows. Funds that mainly hold U.S. Treasuries attracted about $539 million, marking their first inflows in three weeks. Floating-rate loan funds posted $24 million in outflows, marking their second straight week of withdrawals, while inflation-protected bond funds attracted $133 million, marking their first inflows in six weeks.
