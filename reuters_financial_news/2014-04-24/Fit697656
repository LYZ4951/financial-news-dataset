April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Camca Assurance's (CAA) and Camca Reassurance's (CAR) Insurer Financial Strength Ratings (IFS) at 'A' and their Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A-'. The Outlooks are Stable. Both companies, domiciled in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, are owned directly  and indirectly by the 39 banks of Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> (CA; A/Stable).   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the companies' large degree of integration within the  CA group, given their role in guaranting the group's guaranteed residential  loans. Both companies are reliant on their parent for their role, business  position and strategic direction. Their ratings are therefore mainly driven by  CA's ratings.  The Stable Outlook for both companies is directly linked to that of CA group.  Nevertheless, Fitch expects that their capital and earnings will remain  resilient in the next 12-24 months, supported by a strict underwriting  discipline in light of the current weak economic environment, including limited  mortgage funding availability and likely high French unemployment. Fitch expects  that CA's regional banks would provide support, if needed, to their insurance  subsidiaries.  Fitch considers CAA's credit profile to be sound, as evidenced by low defaults  on its guaranteed insurance business for residential loans. CAA's net combined  ratio deteriorated to 85% at FYE13 (end 2012: 68%) but remained at a sound  level. With EUR151m gross written premiums (GWP), CAA posted a EUR15m net profit  for 2013, up 12% on 2012. CAA's financial revenue increased 22% yoy in 2013 and  the company reported EUR11m capital gains. CAR's combined ratio, on the other  hand, sharply improved to 87.5% from 171%, following a material decrease of its  loss ratio due to provision releases.  Fitch views CAA's capital resources as strong. Regulatory solvency ratios  strengthened to 2.7x the minimum required by the regulator. At end-2013 CAR  regulatory solvency was slightly below the minimum required at 98%. However,  CAR's reported solvency position is supplemented by its substantial equalisation  reserve (EUR128m at end-2013), which Fitch considers to be loss-absorbing  capital. When taking into account the sizeable equalisation reserve, CARs'  solvency ratio was 1,390% at end-2013. In March 2014 CAR issued intragroup  EUR500,000 subordinated debt to increase its statutory solvency cover slightly  to above 100%.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
