OSLO, April 24 (Reuters) - The recent flow of stock market listings in the Nordics is set to continue, regional brokerage ABG Sundal Collier's <ASC.OL> chief executive told Reuters after reporting first-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Led by the initial public offering of Danish outsourcing group ISS <ISS.CO> in March, companies and their owners have raised money on all the four major stock markets in the region this year. "The IPO pipeline in all the Nordic countries is looking really good for 2014," Knut Brundtland said, adding that companies seeking to raise large ammounts of cash have an advantage in the current market. "Investors are mostly looking to invest in capital intensive sectors, so that they can make large placements. It's much harder to find investors for smaller amounts. No one wants to look at it." While ISS, OW Bunker <OW.CO> and several other big firms have see their shares soar after listing, some smaller companies, such as Vardia Insurance <VARDIA.OL> and Scanship Holding <SSIP.OL>, have fallen sharply, and ship builder Havyard has delayed its cash call indefinitely. "A five million dollar investment takes just as much work as a 50 million dollar investment, so everyone with a large investment mandate is looking to place larger amounts when they first decide to make a move," Brundtland said. "We see most interest for capital intensive sectors like shipping and offshore. The prices have come down somewhat in the offshore sector, but the shipping sector has remained strong... high growth companies in Biotech and IT also attract attention."
