PRAGUE, April 24 (Reuters) - Czech central bank Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl said on Thursday that he would not favour abandoning currency intervention aimed at weakening the crown until it was clear that interest rates were headed higher.

"For me it would mean to have reasonable certainty that there are, for example, one, two or three rate hikes ahead of me," Hampl told the investicniweb.cz website. "(I need to know) that I will not return to a situation where I have zero interest rates and a need to ease monetary conditions further," Hampl said. The Czech central bank launched exchange rate intervention in November to ward off the threat of deflation. It aims to stop the Czech crown from strengthening significantly beyond around 27 per euro <EURCZK=>. The bank lets the crown float freely on the weak side of that level. In March it said the regime would stay in place at least until the beginning of 2015. Governor Miroslav Singer and board member Lubomir Lizal have since said it could be kept in place for longer.
