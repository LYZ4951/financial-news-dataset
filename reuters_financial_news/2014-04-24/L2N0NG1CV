NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Money manager and arts patron Alberto Vilar was resentenced on Thursday to 10 years in prison, a year longer than previously, in connection with his 2008 conviction for fraud and money laundering.

U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who had imposed the original sentence, said a longer term was justified because Vilar had taken steps to prevent victims of his crimes from being repaid. Sullivan also sentenced Gary Tanaka, Vilar's business partner at the now-defunct Amerindo Investment Advisers Inc, to six years in prison, also a year longer than previously. A federal appeals court last August had ordered both defendants resentenced in light of a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that affected how punishments should be calculated.
