JAKARTA, April 24 (Reuters) - Shares of PT Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN) <BBTN.JK> fell as much as 10 percent on Thursday due to uncertainty about a planned acquisition of the Indonesian lender by PT Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK>.

BTN shares plunged as low as 1,170 rupiah, the lowest since March 11. Mandiri shares were down 0.5 percent, while the Jakarta stock exchange <.JKSE> was 0.1 percent higher. Nearly 125 million BTN shares were traded, double the stock's average full-day volume over the past 30 days. Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Dipo Alam on Wednesday called for a delay in the proposed acquisition, in a circular addressed to government officials as well as the management of the two state-controlled banks. "The transfer of the state-owned shares from BTN to Mandiri has the potential of causing concern among the general public and the employees of BTN, so it should be delayed until there is a comprehensive explanation on the share transfer plan," Alam said. The move came just a week after State-Owned Enterprises Minister Dahlan Iskan told reporters the acquisition would support the demand for mortgages in Southeast Asia's biggest economy and create a more regionally competitive bank. [ID:nL3N0N9170] Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's biggest bank by assets, lends mainly to companies whereas BTN focuses on loans for subsidised housing. "This acquisition has gone through a deep review," Iskan told reporters on Thursday. "The broad society would really benefit from this acquisition." Iskan has struggled to win support for major acquisitions of state firms. In January, the Indonesian parliament rejected a proposed acquisition of gas utility firm Perusahaan Gas Negara <PGAS.JK> by energy company Pertamina [PERTM.UL], local media reported. [ID:nL3N0KU2BI]
