ISTANBUL, April 24 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank kept key interest rates on hold, as expected, on Thursday despite political pressure to cut them since January's aggressive rate hike.

The bank kept its overnight lending rate at 12 percent, its one-week repo rate at 10 percent, and its overnight borrowing rate at 8 percent, as predicted by all but one of 16 economists in a Reuters poll.
