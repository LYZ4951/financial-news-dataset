NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Elizabeth Arden Inc <RDEN.O> has hired Goldman Sachs Group <GS.N> to explore a sale and reached out to a small group of potential buyers, according to people familiar with the matter.

The U.S. cosmetics company, which has a market capitalization of about $960 million, has decided to gauge buyer interest after its share price has come under pressure in the last 12 months amid weak sales in its key North American market, the people said.  The people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Elizabeth Arden did not respond to requests for comment, while Goldman Sachs declined to comment. News of the sale process came after South Korea's LG Household & Healthcare Ltd <051900.KS> said on Wednesday that it is looking at several potential acquisitions, including one for Arden.
