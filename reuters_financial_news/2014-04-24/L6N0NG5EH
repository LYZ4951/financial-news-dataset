MADRID, April 24 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Bankia <BKIA.MC> is expected to triple net profit in the first three months of the year after drastic cost-cutting and billions of euros in state aid, according to a Reuters poll of six analysts.

The poll found net profit at Spain's four-biggest bank by market value would rise to 197 million euros ($272 million) in the period from 74 million euros in the first quarter of 2013.  Bankia announces results on Monday April 28. Eyes will also be on progress in reducing its bad loans ratio, near 15 percent at end-2013, after a 2008 housing crash left the banking sector and millions of Spaniards with barely affordable debt. Following are the results of the poll in simple averages and in millions of euros.
