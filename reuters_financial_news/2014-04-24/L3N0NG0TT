TOKYO, April 24 (Reuters) - Japan's Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance said on Thursday that it plans to continue increasing its yen bond holdings and also keep trimming its domestic stock exposure for the fiscal year through March 2015.

Aioi Nissay Dowa, which said it had 2.8 trillion yen ($27.4 billion) in assets as of March-end 2013, is the non-life insurance arm of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings <8725.T>, Japan's biggest property and casualty insurance group. Aioi Nissay Dowa sees yen bonds, which include government bonds and hedged foreign bonds, as the core of its assets and intends to keep building its portfolio around them, Mitsuhiro Ozawa, staff general manager at its investment planning department, told Reuters in an interview. "Our aim is to increase returns while limiting risk, which entails continuing to reduce our risk assets like stock holdings," Ozawa said. The insurer said it holds more than half of its assets in yen bonds and roughly 20 percent in domestic stocks, with the remainder in unhedged foreign bonds and trust funds. Their stance towards reducing domestic stocks remains undeterred despite the fact that the surge Japanese equities have enjoyed over the past year thanks to economic stimulus implemented by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dubbed "Abenomics." Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei <.N225> gained 57 percent in 2013. "The rise in stocks is of course welcome, but that does not change our mid- to long-term investment view," Ozawa said. "The equity market gains and yen weakening brought on by Abenomics was positive as it made our risk reduction easier. But it also made things tough as it has driven bond yields lower," he said. As a result of the Bank of Japan's massive bond purchases the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield <JP10YTN=JBTC> has been stuck around 0.6 percent in recent months, its lowest level except for two brief stints below that level in 2003 and 2013.
