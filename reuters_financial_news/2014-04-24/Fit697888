April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

A second wave of sales of non-performing loans (NPLs) by banks in Italy may benefit Italian special servicers, which previously did not focus on NPL special servicing or had missed out on larger portfolio sales, Fitch Ratings says.  The sales announced and completed to date have not generated NPL servicing  business for Italian servicers, which may lack operational capacity to manage  the largest NPL portfolios being sold by the big banks, or may not find pricing  attractive. Once their announced recapitalisations are complete, mid-sized banks  might follow the major banks and begin selling portions of their smaller NPL  portfolios. This could create more opportunities for Italian servicers to  purchase smaller portfolios that are less attractive to foreign investors.  Increased NPL sales follow a period of stagnation when banks were unwilling to  crystallise losses through portfolio sales. During this time Italian servicers  diversified into areas such as ABS servicing - Fitch-rated servicers' ABS assets  under management have increased by an average of 150% by value since 2009 - and  servicing unsecured loans. This should be advantageous for them, as most assets  within NPL portfolios now being sold are classed as ABS, such as leases and  unsecured credit lines to SMEs, rather than mortgage backed.  Reviewing strategy and market positioning, with a clear focus on third-party  servicing opportunities, will also boost some servicers' competitive position.  This has sometimes been prompted by ownership changes as financial groups review  participation in the servicing market. For example, in October Prelios finalised  the repurchase of all shares in its credit servicing unit held by DGAD  International Sarl, ultimately owned by Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA>.  The subsequent appointment of an experienced CEO and a new board of directors  will provide clear strategic focus on third-party servicing opportunities, and  greater support from group resources. We affirmed Prelios Credit Servicing's  Italian RMBS and CMBS Special Servicer Ratings at 'RSS2' and 'CSS2' in April.  Servicers that have diversified and re-focused in this way will be best placed  to capitalise on the increase in NPL sales. Sector consolidation could also  allow domestic special servicers to compete with foreign funds for bigger  portfolios.  The increased interest in bad debt sales by Italian banks partly reflects  efforts by the Bank of Italy to get banks to value collateral conservatively in  view of the ECB's Comprehensive Assessment, and may also be influenced by new  tax treatment of loan loss charges and write-offs approved last year. Italian  NPLs rose to EUR156bn at end-2013, 8.1% of total lending, from EUR125bn (6.3%) a  year earlier. The CEO of Prelios Credit Servicing told Bloomberg this month that  he expects Italian banks to sell as much as EUR50bn of bad loans in the next two  to three years.
