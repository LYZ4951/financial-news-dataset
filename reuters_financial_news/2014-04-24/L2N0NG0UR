BOSTON, April 24 (Reuters) - A prominent investor shareholder advisory firm recommended that Sotheby's <BID.N> investors should vote for two of the three board candidates suggested by activist investor Daniel Loeb.

Institutional Shareholder Services sent a report to clients early on Thursday morning that backs Loeb, an avid art collector who has been pushing the auction house to cut costs and become more competitive since last year. A copy was obtained by Reuters.
