PARIS, April 24 (Reuters) - Alstom <ALSO.PA> shareholder Bouygues <BOUY.PA> said it supported the company's strategy but did not have control over it, after Bloomberg reported General Electric <GE.N> was in talks to buy Alstom for around $13 billion.

A spokesman for Bouygues, which has a 29 percent stake in the French train and turbine maker, referred to a statement issued earlier on Thursday in which Alstom said it was not informed of any potential public tender offer for its shares. [ID:nL3N0NF5JT] Asked whether there were any takeover talks, the Bouygues spokesman declined to comment further.
