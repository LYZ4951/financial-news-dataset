HANOI, April 24 (Reuters) - Vietnam's top insurer Baoviet Holdings group <BVH.HM> said on Thursday it expects net profit for this year at 1.18 trillion dong ($56 million), or 4 percent lower than 2013.

Hanoi-based Baoviet has also projected a 7.2 percent rise in revenues in 2014 to 18.33 trillion dong, it said in a statement issued after shareholders approved the Hanoi-based group's business targets earlier on Thursday. The statement gave no reasons for the lower profit outlook.
