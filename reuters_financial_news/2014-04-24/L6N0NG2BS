LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - European shares resumed their upward trend on Thursday as mergers and acquisitions and a solid update from France's Schneider Electric fuelled a rally in the industrial sector.

Shares in Alstom jumped 10.8 percent <ALSO.PA> to the top of the FTSEurofirst 300 after Bloomberg reported that General Electric <GE.N> was in talks to buy the turbine and train maker for about $13 billion.
