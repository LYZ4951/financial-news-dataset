April 24 (Reuters) - Units of Eagle Rock Energy Partners LP <EROC.O> fell 17 percent on Thursday after the partnership said it will suspend its quarterly distribution to preserve liquidity ahead of a deal closure.

Eagle Rock said its $1.3 billion pipeline deal with Regency Energy Partners LP <RGP.N> has been delayed by a second request for documents by the Federal Trade Commission that was made in late February. "This has extended management's original time frame for closing the transaction and created the need to preserve greater liquidity in the interim to fund growth capital expenditure and other financial obligations," Eagle Rock said in a statement late on Wednesday. In December, Regency said it would buy assets in the Texas Panhandle from Eagle Rock for $1.3 billion. Eagle Rock's management intends to resume the quarterly distribution after the Regency deal between the two master limited partnerships (MLPs) closes. MLPs, which trade on stock exchanges in units instead of shares, pay no corporate income taxes and distribute all profits to investors. Investors like MLPs because of their high payouts, but push back when those payouts are threatened. Boardwalk Pipeline Partners <BWP.N>, a $3.3 billion midstream partnership controlled by Loews Corp <L.N> slashed its distribution nearly 80 percent in February on weakening cash flows and a heavy debt load, a move that sent its units down over 40 percent.
