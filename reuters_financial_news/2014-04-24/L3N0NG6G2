April 24 (Reuters) - Privately owned activist fund Relational Investors LLC disclosed a 9.08 percent stake in Clean Harbors Inc <CLH.N>, saying the hazardous waste manager is "undervalued," according to a regulatory filing.

Clean Harbors shares rose 8.6 percent in extended trading. The San Diego, California-based asset manager, which made its initial investment in Clean Harbors in February, said it had discussed ways to raise the company's valuation, including a strategic review and operational improvements.
