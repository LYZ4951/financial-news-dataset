MADRID, April 24 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Caixabank <CABK.MC> on Thursday said first quarter net profit fell by more than half to 152 million euros ($210 million), missing analyst forecasts, compared to a year ago when it was helped by one-off gains from acquisitions.

The Barcelona-based lender was expected to post a 162 million euro net profit, according to the averaged predictions of seven analysts polled by Reuters.
