LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - Franklin Templeton has been able to exploit market panic in emerging markets and investors' lack of differentiation between countries, Michael Hasenstab, the firm's chief investment officer for global bonds in the fixed income group, said on Thursday.

Malaysia, Hungary, Poland and Mexico were countries well-positioned to deal with any changes in Federal Reserve policy, Hasenstab added in a statement. "We were able to exploit some of the market panic and feel that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the dynamics going forward," Hasenstab said. Franklin Templeton is the largest international investor in Ukrainian debt, though Hasenstab did not refer directly to Ukraine in the statement. Hasenstab oversees a team managing around $190 billion at Franklin Templeton, including a flagship $70 billion Global Bond Fund. He has made a name for himself with contrarian investments such as Hungary and Ireland that have generally paid off big time.
