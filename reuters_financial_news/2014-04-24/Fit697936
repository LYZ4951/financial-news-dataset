April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Borrowing by German municipalities using short-term  credit lines known as Kassenkredite has risen, increasing interest rate risk and  refinancing risk in the sector, Fitch Ratings says. This highlights the  importance of initiatives by Laender to reduce reliance on Kassenkredite for  deficit spending.  The latest available data from the German Statistical Office shows that German  municipalities' outstanding Kassenkredite rose to EUR48.75bn at the end of 3Q13,  from EUR47.76bn at the end of 2012 and EUR44.02bn at the end of 2011. A fall in  medium- and long-term capital markets debt outstanding means that Kassenkredite  borrowing has risen to 37% from 34% of total municipality debt.  Low short-term interest rates mean Kassenkredite, which typically have one-year  maturity and are rolled over annually, remain attractive for many  municipalities. However, their increasing use in recent years has increased both  interest rate risk and refinancing risk, which we think is rising as the number  of banks active in the market is falling.  This is primarily due to consolidation and refocusing among Pfandbrief banks.  Sparkassen remain active and some commercial banks have entered the market, but  these lenders are unlikely to be able to meet the refinancing needs of the  entire sector. Banks may continue to withdraw as Kassenkredite lending is a low  margin business with relatively high administrative costs, and in light of  higher capital requirements making them more cautious in deploying core capital.  We think that the detailed commitments by some municipalities via Laender  programmes to consolidate budgets, substitute long-term, fixed rate funding, and  submit to Laender supervision are reducing the risk that high reliance on  Kassenkredite creates for weaker German municipalities. Several hundreds of  municipalities have joined such schemes where they have been introduced,  including in Hessen, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate.
