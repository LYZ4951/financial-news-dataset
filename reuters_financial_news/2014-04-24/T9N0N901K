TOKYO, April 24 (Reuters) - Tokyo District Court ordered liquidation to begin at failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, the company said on Thursday, after the bankruptcy administrator said on April 16 that it would be difficult to rehabilitate the firm. [ID:nL3N0N81HT]

Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection on Feb. 28, saying that 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins had been taken from the exchange due to a security flaw in its code, as well as 100,000 belonging to the exchange. It also said that $27 million was missing from its bank accounts.
