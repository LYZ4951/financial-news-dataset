April 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Cerba European Lab SAS's  (Cerba; B+/Stable) planned tap issue of EUR80m of senior secured notes expected  ratings of 'BB-(EXP)' and 'RR3(EXP)'.  The proceeds will be used to fund the bolt-on acquisition of JS Bio SELAS and  related entities (JS Bio), a network of 36 collection centres and six technical  platforms in the south east of France, refinance JS Bio's existing debt as well  as pay related fees. The impact of this acquisition on Cerba's credit profile is  neutral (see 'Fitch: No Impact on Cerba's Rating from Acquisition in South  Eastern France' dated 7 April 2014). The assignment of the final ratings is  contingent on the completion of the JS Bio acquisition and the receipt of final  documents materially conforming to information already reviewed. Pending completion of the acquisition, the proceeds of the tap issue notes will  be deposited in an escrow account. While in escrow, the notes will not be  guaranteed and will be secured by a first-ranking charge over the escrow  account. If the acquisition is not completed prior to 31 October 2014, the notes  will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at par plus any accrued and  unpaid interest. Upon completion of the acquisition, the tap issue notes will  share the same key terms and conditions as the existing EUR365m 7% senior  secured notes due 2020. They will be senior secured obligations of Cerba  European Lab SAS and share the same ranking, coupon and maturity. They will also  benefit from the same incurrence-based covenants, security package and  guarantees.  Cerba's EUR50m revolving credit facility - assumed to be fully drawn in a  default scenario - will continue to rank ahead of the senior secured notes on  enforcement proceeds. However, despite the higher amount of senior secured debt,  the contribution of JS Bio to the total enterprise value in a distressed  scenario supports our expectation of an above-average recovery rate for the tap  noteholders within the 51%-70% range, corresponding to a Recovery Rating of  'RR3'. This is in line with our recovery expectations for existing senior  secured noteholders.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak Credit Metrics The group's credit metrics are weak and commensurate with a 'B+' IDR within the  healthcare sector. We expect Cerba's free cash flow generation to remain  constrained to low-mid single digits (as a percentage of revenue) as a result of  high cash interest paid on the senior secured notes.  Acquisitions to Drive Mild Deleveraging Fitch expects bolt-on acquisitions to support mild deleveraging prospects over  the medium term. Despite uncertainty surrounding the exact timing of  acquisitions, we continue to expect funds from operations (FFO) adjusted gross  leverage to remain below 6.5x by 2015-2016 (adjusted for 12 month-contribution  of acquisitions including that of JS Bio). In an environment of persistent  pressure on reimbursement tariffs from public entities, we believe that Cerba is  reliant on successfully integrating these primarily debt-funded acquisitions and  extracting synergies to increase EBITDA and FFO.   Leading Clinical Laboratories Player Cerba is a leading player in the clinical pathology laboratories market in  France. The group benefits from a strong reputation for scientific expertise and  innovation at the specialised end of the market (37% of FY13 reported revenue,  excluding intercompany sales). Cerba is also developing a network of routine  labs (32% of revenue) around regional platforms that demonstrates its logistical  ability to handle a high volume of tests. The IDR is supported by resilient  like-for-like performance, which Fitch expects to continue, underpinned by  growing volumes and fairly stable profitability margins.   Business and Geographical Diversification The group's activities in its Central Lab division globally (12% of sales) as  well as its presence in the Belgian and Luxembourg routine markets (23% of  sales) provide some geographical diversification and reduce Cerba's exposure to  the French healthcare system. Nonetheless, Fitch takes a positive view of the  agreement signed in October 2013 between the French clinical pathology  laboratories unions and the authorities as it mitigates the possibility of  drastic reimbursement cuts until 2016, provided volumes do not increase beyond  certain thresholds.   Track Record of Acquisitive Strategy The ratings also reflect Cerba's ability to take advantage of the fragmentation  of the French routine market. In our view, Cerba's acquisitive strategy is  sensible as it enables the group to broaden its network of labs around regional  platforms while realising synergies and increasing scale. We consider the  operational execution risk is reduced by management's experience with similar  expansion plans. We have assumed Cerba will spend up to EUR50m p.a. on small  bolt-on acquisitions over the next two years. A larger acquisition such as that  of JS Bio would be considered as event risk.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions include  - Ability to increase scale via acquisitions while improving financial  flexibility, resulting in a FFO adjusted leverage below 5.0x and FFO interest  coverage above 3.0x on a sustained basis (pro forma for acquisitions).  Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include  -Inability to increase EBITDA and FFO such that the FFO adjusted leverage  exceeds 6.5x and FFO interest coverage decreases below 2.0x on a sustained basis  (pro forma for acquisitions).LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE
