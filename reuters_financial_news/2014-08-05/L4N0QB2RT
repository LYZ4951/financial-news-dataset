MUMBAI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - India's central bank kept its key policy repo rate unchanged on Tuesday as widely expected, but warned about inflationary risks should a shortfall in monsoon rains spark a surge in food prices.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also lowered banks' minimum bond holding requirements, known as the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), by half a percentage point to 22.0 percent to free up more money for lending, effective from Aug. 9.  -- Timeline for repo rate changes  [ID:nL4N0QB2RV]  -- Timeline for CRR changes[ID:nL4N0QB2RS]  -- Timeline for SLR changes[ID:nL4N0QB2RR] Here is a timeline of changes to the reverse repo rate   since February 2001.* RATE (percent)EFFECTIVE DATE (day-month-year)   7.00  28-01-2014   6.75  29-10-2013   6.50  20-09-2013 6.25  03-05-2013   6.50  19-03-2013   6.75  29-01-2013 7.00  17-04-20127.50  25-11-20117.25  16-09-20117.00  26-07-20116.50  16-06-20116.25  03-05-20115.75  17-03-20115.50  25-01-20115.25  02-11-20105.00  16-09-20104.50  27-07-20104.00  02-07-20103.75  20-04-20103.50  19-03-20103.25  21-04-20093.50  04-03-20094.00  02-01-20095.00  08-12-20086.00  25-07-20065.75  08-06-20065.50  24-01-20065.25  26-10-20055.00  29-04-20054.75  27-10-20044.50  25-08-20035.00  03-03-20035.50  30-10-20025.75  27-06-20026.00  05-03-20026.50  28-05-20016.75  27-04-20017.00  02-03-2001
