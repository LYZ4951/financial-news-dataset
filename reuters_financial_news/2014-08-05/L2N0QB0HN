NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group <AIG.N> will not see a sudden shift in strategy in coming months as its leadership changes, the company's incoming chief executive said on Tuesday.

"There will be no abrupt change in strategy," said Peter Hancock, who will take the reins as CEO on Sept. 1, calling his appointment "a vote for continuity."
