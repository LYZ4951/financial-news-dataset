SEOUL, Aug 5 (Reuters) - South Korean shares dropped on Tuesday for their worst daily percentage loss since mid-June after a survey showed China's services sector growth fell to a record low, scaring investors away from risky assets.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.7 percent at 2,066.25 points after the China services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit fell to 50.0 in July, the lowest reading since November 2005 when the data collection began. Institutions dumped a net 305.6 billion won ($297.31 million) worth of KOSPI shares, weighing down the bourse.
