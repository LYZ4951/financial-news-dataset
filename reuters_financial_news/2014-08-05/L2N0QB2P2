BOGOTA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Colombia's biggest bank Bancolombia <BIC.CN> <CIB.N> on Tuesday reported net profit more than doubled in the second quarter versus the same period a year earlier, on the back of an expansion of its loan portfolio and lower costs.

In a filing with the financial regulator, Bancolombia said consolidated net profit reached 467.3 billion pesos ($248.7 million) during the three-month period, up from 209.7 billion a year earlier. That is equivalent to 508 pesos per share, or $1.08 per American Depositary Receipt, it said.  The second-quarter profit is 8 percent less than the bank registered in the first quarter. Bancolombia's loan portfolio reached 89.5 trillion pesos, up 23.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.
