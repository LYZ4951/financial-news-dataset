ZURICH, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Steps to shrink Switzerland's housing bubble are taking effect, according to a quarterly study by Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX>.

Mortgage lenders, the government and the central bank have come up with a variety of measures to combat rising property prices fuelled by ultra-low interest rates, immigration and Switzerland's appeal as a safe haven for financial investors. Those include temporarily demanding more capital against mortgage lending, plans to no longer allow pension funds as down payments for property, and stiffer standards for mortgage loans.

The index - which compares a series of data sets including purchase prices, rents and household debt - rose just 0.02 points to 1.24 points in the second quarter. It stood at 1.15 in the second quarter of 2013. Risks remained in hotspots like lakeside residential areas in Zurich and Geneva, UBS said. The Swiss National Bank (SNB), which cannot lift interest rates due to a cap it has set on the Swiss franc, has long fretted about rising house prices and bank lending. In January, the government doubled the level of capital banks must hold against their mortgage book on the advice of the SNB, after a failed attempt last year to cool the housing boom.  Switzerland is increasingly becoming a test case for how to control mortgage lending, said UBS. "The regulator's credible backdrop of threats suggests that in case of renewed acceleration of prices and debt, the regulatory screw would be tightened further," UBS said.
