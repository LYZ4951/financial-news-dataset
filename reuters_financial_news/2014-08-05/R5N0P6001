SOFIA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - A Bulgarian law professor and former Socialist lawmaker was named as caretaker prime minister on Tuesday, to govern the Balkan state for two months as it grapples with the fallout of its worst banking crisis since the 1990s.

The 57-year-old Georgi Bliznashki will become prime minister while Rumen Porozhanov, a 49-year-old former senior civil servant, will be finance minister, President Rosen Plevneliev said in a televised statement.
