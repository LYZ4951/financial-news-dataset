JAKARTA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Indonesia's economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, the statistics bureau said on Tuesday.

In April-June, the economy expanded 5.12 percent from a year earlier. That compared with the median forecast of 5.30 percent in a Reuters poll and was slightly below the first quarter's growth of 5.21 percent.  KEY POINTS: - Q2 GDP +5.12 pct y/y, vs forecast of +5.30 pct - Q2 GDP +2.47 pct q/q, vs forecast of +2.63 pct  For graphic of GDP, see: http://link.reuters.com/bam85s  COMMENTARY: LEO PUTRA RINALDY, ECONOMIST WITH MANDIRI SEKURITAS "Data from the statistics agency suggests that the slowdown is mainly caused by slowing investment. Political conditions in the second quarter may have caused some businesses to hold their investments and tightening in monetary policy by the central bank is also starting to materialise, especially in the property sector. "After the elections, investments should start picking up although some may wait for the Constitutional Court ruling regarding the election result. Joko Widodo's economic policy will not show its impact on the economy this year because he will only take office in October, but at least investments will start to pick up post-election, which should be good for the economy in the second half." BACKGROUND:- Bank Indonesia expected economic growth at the lower end of its 5.1-5.5 percent target in 2014, much slower than last year's 5.78 percent.  - Annual inflation in July eased to 4.53 percent, well inside the central bank's target for the year of 3.5-5.5 percent. - The trade deficit for the first half of 2014 was $1.15 billion, much smaller than the $3.341 billion gap in the first six months of last year. - The HSBC Markit purchasing managers' index for July showed an expansion in manufacturing activity. The index stayed at 52.7, the record high it reached in June.  - Bank Indonesia lifted its key reference rate by 175 basis points during June-November last year to 7.50 percent, aiming to ease pressures on the rupiah and contain the current-account deficit.
