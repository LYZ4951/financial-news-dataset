HONG KONG, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished slightly higher on Tuesday, as strong gains from index heavyweights HSBC and Tencent outweighed weakness at Chinese banks and energy firms, which were under pressure in a retracement of recent jumps.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> rose 0.2 percent at 24,648.26 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 0.7 percent. Tencent <0700.HK> climbed 3.3 percent to a record high. HSBC Holdings <0005.HK> advanced 1.8 percent, its biggest one-day gain since September 2013, in spite of reporting a 12 percent drop in first-half profit on Monday. [ID:nL6N0QA2ZE] Nomura said in a note on Tuesday the earnings downgrade cycle should stop for Europe's largest bank, citing a better second half revenue outlook due to Asia's improving macroeconomic situation and expectations of higher rates in Britain and United States.
