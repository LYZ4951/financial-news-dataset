MILAN, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Italy's biggest bank by assets UniCredit <CRDI.MI> said the impact of sanctions against Russia on the group was "marginal", saying the bank had estimated it at maximum 10-15 million euros ($13-20 million) in lost revenues.

Federico Ghizzoni also told analysts in a conference call that the lender was looking at potential partners to enhance growth at its asset management unit Pioneer.
