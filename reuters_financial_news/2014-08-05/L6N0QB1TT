PARIS, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> said on Tuesday that it was starting discussions with U.S. authorities over possible sanctions breaches after France's third-biggest listed bank completed an internal review of U.S. dollar transactions.

This signals progress in the negotiations a month after France's biggest listed bank, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, pleaded guilty on two criminal charges, accepted a ban on certain dollar clearing activities and agreed to pay a total of $8.97 billion to resolve accusations it violated U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran over a 10-year period up to 2012.

The bank said it had sent the results of its internal review to the U.S. authorities. Credit Agricole gave no details about its litigation provisions, saying it considered them adequate. As of the end of 2013, Credit Agricole's total litigation provisions stood at 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion). Credit Agricole had a significantly smaller amount of U.S. dollar transactions involving countries under U.S. sanctions than larger banks during the period from 2003 to 2008, Chifflet added. Societe Generale, France's second-biggest bank, said last week that it increased its litigation provisions by 200 million euros to 900 million as of the end of June, without giving any further details.
