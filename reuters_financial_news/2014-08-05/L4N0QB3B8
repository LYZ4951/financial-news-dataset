MUMBAI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Indian shares gained for a second consecutive session after the central bank lowered minimum bond holding requirements for lenders to spur investment, sending blue-chips such as mortgage lender HDFC <HDFC.NS> and Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> higher.

The Reserve Bank of India kept its key policy repo rate unchanged on Tuesday as widely expected, but cut the statutory liquidity ratio by half a percentage point to 22.0 percent of deposits, effective from Aug. 9. [ID:nL4N0QB1MU] Sentiment was got a boost after overseas investors, who were supporting a 22.9 percent rally in India's broader NSE index so far this year, turned buyers on Monday after selling $494.7 million worth of Indian shares in the previous three sessions. Foreign investors bought Indian shares worth $61.10 million on Monday, exchange and regulatory data showed. "RBI policy was quite pragmatic one and is anticipating a growth revival. The focus is shifting from just inflation management to facilitate revival of growth in the economy. And the market has taken it in its full-sense," said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Securities. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> gained 0.72 percent to 25,908.01 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> added 0.82 percent to 7,746.55 points. Hopes that increased lending after the RBI measures would help spur investment lifted some blue-chips. Auto stocks were among the leading gainers. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd <MAHM.NS> gained 3.8 percent, while Bajaj Auto Ltd <BAJA.NS> closed up 3.2 percent and Tata Motors Ltd <TAMO.NS> added 2.3 percent. Real-estate stocks also gained. DLF Ltd <DLF.NS> was up 2.2 percent while Unitech Ltd <UNTE.NS> added 6.6 percent. Lenders also rose, with State Bank of India <SBI.NS> adding 0.5 percent, Bank of Baroda <BOB.NS> ending up 1.2 percent and Union Bank of India <UNBK.NS> closing 1.9 percent higher. Among other gainers, Cummins India <CUMM.NS> ended 7.04 percent higher as analysts said the company management has raised revenue guidance. [ID:nL4N0QB1OK] However, shares in Tata Communications Ltd <TATA.NS> closed down 2.4 percent after the company reported a net loss in the June quarter. [ID:nL4N0QB223] Among other decliners, Petronet LNG <PLNG.NS> fell 4.1, declining for the second straight day on broker downgrades after June-quarter earnings lagged some analysts' estimates.
