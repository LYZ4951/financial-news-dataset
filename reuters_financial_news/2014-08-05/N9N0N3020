BRASILIA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Growth in Brazil's services sector slowed to a near halt in July despite a strong increase in activity at hotels and restaurants, a private survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting the World Cup offered only a limited boost to the country's sluggish economy.

HSBC's Purchasing Managers Index for Brazilian services <BRPMIS=ECI> dropped on a seasonally adjusted basis to 50.2 in July from a six-month high of 51.4 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The increase was too small to offset a sharp decline in manufacturing activity, the fourth in a row. As a result, HSBC's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> for the country edged down to 49.3 in July from 49.9 in June. Brazil's economy has slowed to a near halt in recent months, and some economists have said it might have entered a recession as factories cut back on production and consumers curb spending. The survey showed the soccer World Cup, which ended on July 13, supported solid growth in hotels and restaurants and financial companies. However, companies in the Renting and Business Activities sector reported weaker activity. The World Cup also pushed up prices in hotels and restaurants at a stronger pace than in the rest of the services sector, according to the survey. Prices of services have risen at a faster rate than Brazil's overall inflation rate. Business sentiment in the sector worsened slightly in July. Still, it remained above the lows of April and May 2014, noted Andre Loes, chief Brazil economist at HSBC.
