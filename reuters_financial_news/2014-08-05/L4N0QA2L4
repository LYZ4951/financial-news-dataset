HONG KONG, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong and China shares slipped on Tuesday after a survey showed growth In China's services sector fell to a record low, with property developers the main underperformers.

The HSBC/Markit China services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.0 in July, the lowest reading since November 2005 when the data collection began, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. [ID:nL4N0QA16T] By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> inched 0.1 percent lower at 24,572.63 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong lost 0.6 percent.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings fell 0.4 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was off 0.3 percent at 2,216.42 points. Both closed at their highest in almost eight months on Monday. Zheng Weigang, a senior trader at Shanghai Securities, said he did not see a big impact from the services PMI on the markets. "Economic data need to corroborate each other. We need further observation at the moment."   "Most investors are still in bullish mood and inclined to choose those blue-chips which have growth potential in the current macroeconomic environment. It's not crazy optimism but cautious optimism," Zheng added. Some economists blamed a slowdown in the housing market for the weak reading, as property-related activities saw less business.
