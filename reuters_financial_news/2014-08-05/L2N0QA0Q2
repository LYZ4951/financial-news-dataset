SAO PAULO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Net income at Grupo BTG Pactual SA <BBTG11.SA> likely was the highest in more than two years in the second quarter after a jump in income from proprietary investments and advisory helped offset higher expenses, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

São Paulo-based BTG Pactual, which under the stewardship of controlling shareholder André Esteves is expanding in global reinsurance, commodities trading and wealth management, probably earned 909 million reais ($402 million) in the quarter, the poll of four analysts found. The number was the highest since the last quarter of 2011. Profit rose 9.3 percent from the prior three months and 39.8 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting an across-the-board gain in revenues, the poll said. Results will be published late on Tuesday. Management will discuss results with investors at a conference call the following day. On a quarterly basis, investment-banking revenue rose 32 percent as mergers and acquisitions and bond offerings recovered, and Brazil had its largest share offering in about four years. Esteves' drive to trade more physical commodities bore fruit as the sales and trading division captured more business. Principal investments - or income from investing the bank's own money in hedge funds, private-equity investments and real estate - had a surplus of 342 million reais in the quarter, compared with a shortfall of 115 million reais in the first three months, the poll found. Sales and trading fell on a sequential basis, but income stood above last year's quarterly average, a sign of healthy revenue generation in that line. Total revenue rose 8.9 percent on a quarterly basis to 1.857 billion reais in the quarter, the poll said. On an annual basis, it probably rose 84.8 percent from 1.005 billion reais. Return on equity, or a measure of profitability that gauges how well the bank spends shareholder money, probably ended the second quarter at 21 percent, up from 20.2 percent in the first quarter and 17.5 percent a year earlier, according to the poll. Esteves points to long-term annualized ROEs, as the gauge is known, of around 20 percent. Operating expenses probably rose 13.5 percent in a quarter-on-quarter basis, analysts said, after bonus and compensation payouts, as well as surging general and administrative spending.
