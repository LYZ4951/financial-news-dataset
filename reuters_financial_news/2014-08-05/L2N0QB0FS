BOSTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Hedge fund company Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC <OZM.N> reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday as assets rose to record levels amid fresh demand for portfolios that invest in real estate, stocks and credit.

The New York-based company, one of only a handful of publicly listed hedge fund firms, reported second-quarter distributable earnings of $90.4 million, or 18 cents a share, as assets under management hit $45.9 billion on June 30. Distributable earnings exclude costs from Och-Ziff's November 2007 initial public offering.
