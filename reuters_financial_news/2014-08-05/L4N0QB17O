MUMBAI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - India's central bank kept its key policy repo rate unchanged on Tuesday as widely expected, but warned about inflationary risks should a shortfall in monsoon rains spark a surge in food prices.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also lowered banks' minimum bond holding requirements, known as the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), by half a percentage point to 22.0 percent to free up more money for lending, effective from Aug. 9. The RBI kept the repo rate <INREPO=ECI> unchanged at 8.00 percent as expected by nearly all 43 economists polled by Reuters ahead of the policy review. The repo rate has been unchanged since January, when the RBI increased it by a quarter percentage point. [ID:nS8N0OK02W]  COMMENTARY UPASNA BHARDWAJ, ECONOMIST, ING VYSYA BANK, MUMBAI "RBI's policy today has been slightly hawkish than the last statement by shifting the inflation target from 8 percent towards the medium term target of 6 percent, thereby further affirming our view of a pause on the repo rate front at least through this year."  KILLOL PANDYA, FUND MANAGER-DEBT AT LIC NOMURA MUTUAL FUND, MUMBAI "The initial outcome seem quite hawkish on inflation as the inflation target has been shifted from 8 percent towards the medium term target of around 6 percent. Rest of the things are pretty much in line with market expectations. It seems like there would not be any rate cuts at least in this calendar year."  BACKGROUND - India's annual consumer price inflation <INCPIY=ECI> rose 7.31 percent in June from a year earlier - the lowest since figures were first published in January 2012 - helped by a slowdown in food inflation and a favourable statistical base. [ID:nL4N0PP3YQ] - India's wholesale price inflation <INWPI=ECI> in June eased to a four-month low of 5.43 percent, helped by slower increases in food and fuel costs. [ID:nL4N0PP3YQ] - India's industrial production <INIP=ECI> grew an annual 4.7 percent in May, the highest since October 2012, providing welcome positive news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new government as manufacturing activity and electricity generation increased. [ID:nL4N0PM35C] - Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said the central bank was "determined" to make sure consumer inflation eases down along a "glide path." [ID:nL4N0PL497] - India's fiscal deficit <INFISC=ECI> in the first quarter of the 2014/15 financial year touched 2,978.59 billion rupees ($49.2 billion), or 56.1 percent of the full-year target.
