DUBAI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Dubai's stock market may lose steam on Tuesday after second-quarter earnings from property giant Emaar <EMAR.DU>, while a weak global environment may restrain other regional markets.

The main Dubai stock index <.DFMGI> climbed 1.3 percent on Monday as Emaar rose in anticipation of the earnings, gaining 3.1 percent to 10.15 dirhams in its heaviest turnover for a month.  After the close it reported quarterly net profit up 28.6 percent to 868 million dirhams ($236 million). That beat analysts' average forecast of 839.8 million dirhams only marginally - not enough to please some investors who had bet on a positive surprise - while revenue from Emaar's property sales in Dubai dropped in a possible sign that higher prices are starting to slow the emirate's property boom. [ID:nL6N0QA2IX]   The results were not bearish, and will not change analysts' generally positive view of the stock; 11 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters have a mean price target of 10.79 dirhams, with nine rating it a "buy" or a "strong buy". Also, interest in the stock will remain buoyed by expectations that the planned initial public offer of its malls unit will go ahead as soon as in September. However, some short-term investors who bought into the stock may now be encouraged to take profits, especially given the global market backdrop. Although U.S. stocks rebounded moderately on Monday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> is down 0.5 percent after the China services purchasing managers' index compiled by HSBC/Markit fell to 50.0 in July from a 15-month high of 53.1 in June. [ID:nL4N0QB01D] Egypt's market may also be dampened by news that business activity there shrank in July, according to the HSBC Egypt Purchasing Managers Index, released on Tuesday. It is a sign that the economy remains fragile after cuts to energy subsidies last month led to lower demand and higher prices.[ID:nL6N0QA1TM]
