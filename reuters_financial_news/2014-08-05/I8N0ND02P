MUMBAI, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Indian shares gained for a second consecutive session after the central bank lowered minimum bond holding requirements for lenders to spur investment, sending blue-chips such as mortgage lender HDFC <HDFC.NS> and Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> higher.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.72 percent higher at 25,908.01, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended up 0.82 percent at 7,746.55.
