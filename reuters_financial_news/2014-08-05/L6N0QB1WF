LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - European shares traded a touch higher early on Tuesday as strong results from German car maker BMW and other blue-chip stocks supported an otherwise subdued market.

Shares in BMW <BMWG.DE> traded 2.9 percent higher after the luxury car maker reported a higher-than-expected second-quarter operating profit, helped by new offroad models and strong China sales.

Brokers said the bank's profit before taxes was higher than they expected. [ID:nP6N0O901H]
