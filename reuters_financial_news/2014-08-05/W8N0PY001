WARSAW, August 5 (Reuters) - Poland's No.2 lender Bank Pekao <PEO.WA> wants to finish this year with a net profit similar to that from 2013, Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio said on Tuesday.

Analysts expect the Polish unit of Italy's UniCredit <CRDI.MI> to raise its 2014 net profit by 3 percent to 2.871 billion zlotys ($924 million) from 2.785 billion last year, according to Reuters data.
