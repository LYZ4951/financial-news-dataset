HONG KONG, Aug 5 (Reuters) - China shares slipped off nearly eight-month highs on Tuesday, after a survey showed the country's services sector slowly sharply in July to its lowest level in nearly nine years.

The HSBC/Markit China services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.0 in July, the lowest reading since November 2005 when the data collection began, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. [ID:nL4N0QA16T] The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.2 percent at 2,219.95 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.3 percent. Some economists blamed a slowdown in the housing market for the weak reading, as property-related activities saw less business.
