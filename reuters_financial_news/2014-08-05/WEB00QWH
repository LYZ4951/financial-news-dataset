FRANKFURT, Aug 5 (Reuters) - German publisher Axel Springer <SPRGn.DE> reported an 8 percent rise in its core profit fuelled by its digital activities which made up more than half of its revenues.

The publisher of Germany's top-selling daily "Bild" said on Tuesday earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 147.8 million euros ($198.4 million). That was in line the average of 147 million euros in a poll, commissioned by Reuters. [ID:nL6N0QA2SP]
