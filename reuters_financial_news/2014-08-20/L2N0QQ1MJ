NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> plans to raise pay for junior bankers by 20 percent next year, the New York Post reported on Wednesday.

The pay raise means that first-year analysts will earn about $85,000 before collecting bonuses in 2015, the newspaper said. Analysts who have been at the Wall Street bank longer will earn more. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
