Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles is preparing a lawsuit against Angelo Mozilo, the former chief executive of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp, and up to 10 other employees, Bloomberg reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.

The U.S. government is using the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act to sue Mozilo for his company's role in inflating the U.S housing bubble before the 2008 financial crisis, Bloomberg cited the people as saying. (http://bloom.bg/1vivmA9) Mozilo in 2010 agreed to a settlement of $67.5 million to resolve charges of duping the company's investors while lining his own pockets. Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, which bought Countrywide for $2.5 billion in 2008, had said it would pick up two-thirds of the tab.
