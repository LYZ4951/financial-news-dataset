VIENNA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Austrian lender BAWAG PSK [CCMLPB.UL] accelerated profit growth in the second quarter and more strong results ahead as it boosts revenue and keeps a tight hold on costs.

BAWAG, owned by U.S. investor Cerberus Capital Management [CBS.UL], is one of six Austrian banks to come under direct supervision of the European Central Bank in November. It has dismissed as speculation talk that Cerberus could soon exit.
