MOSCOW, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest mobile phone operator MTS <MBT.N> <MTSS.MM> cut its full-year sales and core profit forecasts on Wednesday, citing instability in Ukraine, its second-biggest market.

MTS cut its revenue growth target to "more than 1 percent" from the earlier 3-5 percent range and said it now expects operating income before depreciation and amortisation to be flat year-on-year, having previously forecast a 2 percent increase. The company reported a 1.4 percent increase in second-quarter revenue to 98.9 billion roubles ($2.7 billion), slightly below analysts' forecast of a 1.7 percent rise.
