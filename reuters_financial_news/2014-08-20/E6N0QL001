BRASILIA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Brazil's government will create a new covered bond to raise funding for real estate loans and ease rules to boost mortgage and auto loans, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said on Wednesday in yet another effort to boost a stagnant economy.

"Credit retreated too sharply but it will improve, though at a gradual pace," Mantega told journalists at a briefing.
