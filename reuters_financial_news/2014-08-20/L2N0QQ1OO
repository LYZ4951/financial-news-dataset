NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - LPL Financial, the largest U.S. independent broker-dealer by sales force, said Wednesday it added to its network a new independent registered investment advisory group with 13 financial advisers.

The Washington D.C.-based group, Financial Advisory Network, has four teams of advisers managing a combined $450 million in client assets.  The firm's advisers manage a mix of fee-based and commission-based accounts with clients the financial industry describes as mass affluent, a category of clients who typically have over $100,000 in investable assets.
