SYDNEY, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Australian Securities Exchange <ASX.AX> posted a 10 percent rise in annual net profit on Thursday, meeting estimates, led by higher share floats in the year.

ASX Ltd posted net profit of A$383.2 ($355.8) for the year-ended June compared with A$348.2 a year ago. That was up from a A$381.2 million estimate from 15 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It declared a final dividend of 89.9 cents, up 9.2 percent. ASX has benefited from a strong recovery in initial public offerings in recent months. Australia had record new listings in the six months to June 30, with $4.1 billion raised, some five times the amount over the same period last year. [ID:nL4N0Q30KY]
