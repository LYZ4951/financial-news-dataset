LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - British engineering company Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> on Wednesday rejected Carillion's <CLLN.L> third merger proposal, saying it failed to address its concerns over risks to the business.

Balfour said its board had unanimously concluded that the offer was not in the best interest of its shareholders and did not address concerns over the sale of its U.S. design and engineering business Parsons Brinckerhoff and the risks associated with reducing its UK construction business.
