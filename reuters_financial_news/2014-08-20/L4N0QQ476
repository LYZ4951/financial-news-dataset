Aug 18 (Reuters) - Asset manager Eaton Vance Corp's <EV.N> quarterly profit tripled, due to a big drop in the company's non-operating expenses.

Net income attributable to the company's shareholders rose to $77.9 million, or 63 cents per share, in the third quarter ended July 31, from $23.2 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. [ID:nPn7Xyb2L]
