SOFIA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - An unidentified fund based in Vienna has expressed interest in rescuing Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> and will present a concrete plan to do so within 10 days, Bulgaria's Prime Minister Georgi Bliznashki said on Wednesday.

The fate of the country's fourth-largest lender has been in limbo since June, when a run on deposits at the bank prompted the central bank to seize control and close its operations.
