LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Argentina's dollar bonds maturing 2033 fell almost 2 cents on Wednesday to trade at 80.6 cents in the dollar after President Cristina Fernandez proposed to swap the debt for new bonds governed by domestic law.

Such a swap would effectively allow Argentina to skirt a U.S. court ruling that requires it to pay in full hedge funds that did not participate in earlier debt restructurings. The country is reluctant to comply and missed a bond coupon payment due at the end of June. Fernandez unveiled legislation that seeks to push bondholders to swap defaulted debt for new notes governed by Argentine law, instead of New York law which governs the existing bonds. The 2033 Discount bond <US040114gl81=R> now yields more than 11 percent while Argentine bond yield spreads over U.S. Treasuries have widened more than 100 basis points since the start of August and stand now at 763 bps <11EML>
