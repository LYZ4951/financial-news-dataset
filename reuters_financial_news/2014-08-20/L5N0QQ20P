CAIRO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound remained stable at a dollar sale by the central bank on Wednesday.

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds per dollar, the same as its price in its last sale, on Monday. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed in a tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday.
