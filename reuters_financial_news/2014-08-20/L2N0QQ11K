BUENOS AIRES, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Argentina's country risk rose slightly on Wednesday, the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus showed, after the government said it planned to pay its foreign-currency bonds locally to skirt a U.S. court ruling that prevented the government from servicing its debt.

The South American country's risk climbed 1.4 percent to 779 basis points over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries on JP Morgan's index <11EMJ>. The index as a whole stood at 297 as of 9:59 a.m. local time (1259 GMT).
