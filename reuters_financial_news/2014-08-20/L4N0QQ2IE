HONG KONG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - China's Shengjing Bank plans to raise $1 billion through a Hong Kong initial public offering this year, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the situation.

The Shenyang-based city commercial lender is scheduled to file a listing application to the Hong Kong stock exchange as early as September, IFR said. Shengjing Bank joined the queue of Chinese banks targeting a Hong Kong listing, after waiting for a few years to go public domestically, IFR reported.  Huishang Bank <3698.HK>, Bank of ChongQing <1963.HK> and Harbin Bank <6138.HK> all listed in Hong Kong in the past year.
