SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd <WES.AX> reported a 19 percent rise in annual net profit on Wednesday, underpinned by the disposal of its insurance underwriting operations and strong sales growth at its Coles supermarket and Bunnings hardware retail businesses.

The coal-to-retail conglomerate posted net profit of A$2.69 billion ($2.5 billion) in the year to June, up from A$2.26 billion a year ago, beating an average forecast of A$2.4 billion from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
