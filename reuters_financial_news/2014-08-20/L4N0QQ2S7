HANOI, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.34 percent on Wednesday to reach its highest close since Aug. 7, lifted by gains on some blue-chips that offset net selling by foreign investors.

Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, the top lender by market value, rose 2.71 percent to end at a four-month high and in large volume, Reuters data showed. The bank, 15 percent owned by Japan's Mizuho Corporate Bank <8411.T>, last week reported a 13 percent rise in first half net profit. "Despite gains in the market, investors should be cautious as foreign investors have been constantly offloading stocks in August," said Nguyen Thanh Lam, a deputy manager at Maybank Kim Eng Securities. Foreigners have sold a net 1.4 trillion dong ($66.1 million) so far this month, 11 times the net value sold for the whole of July, exchange data showed.
