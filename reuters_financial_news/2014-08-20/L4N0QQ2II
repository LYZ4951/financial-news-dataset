SYDNEY, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd <AMP.AX> reported a 3 percent fall in first-half net profit on Thursday as an increase in underlying profit was erased by restructuring costs.

Australia's third-biggest retail funds manager reported underlying profit of A$510 million ($473.33 million) for the six months to June 30, compared with A$440 million the previous year. Including one-off items such as restructuring costs, interim net profit fell to A$382 million from A$393 million.
