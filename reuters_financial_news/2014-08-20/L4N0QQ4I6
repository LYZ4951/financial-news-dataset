Aug 20 (Reuters) - John Shaffer, who co-heads Goldman Sachs Group Inc's <GS.N> New York credit sales, will leave by the end of the year, a company spokeswoman said.

Avanish Bhavsar, who currently oversees cross-assets sales will take over the additional role of co-head of credit sales for the U.S. with Jon Meltzer, Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said. Galvin said an internal memo to announce the departure did not mention Shaffer's future plans.
