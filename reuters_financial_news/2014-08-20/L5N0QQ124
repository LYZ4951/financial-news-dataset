JOHANNESBURG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Shares of South African banks <.JBANK> fell on Wednesday after a Moody's ratings downgrade the previous day that cited a lower likelihood of support from the central bank to protect creditors in the wake of African Bank's <ABLJ.J> debt crisis.    The banking index <.JBANK> was down 1.2 percent shortly after trade began, with Nedbank <NEDJ.J> losing the most among peers Standard Bank <SBKJ.J>, FirstRand <FSRJ.J> and Barclays Africa Group <BGAJ.J>.
