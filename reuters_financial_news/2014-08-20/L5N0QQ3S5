MOSCOW, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Russia's second-largest bank VTB <VTBR.MM> is expected to report an 8 percent rise in second-quarter year-on-year net profit, helped by greater lending to Russian companies shut out of international capital markets because of the Ukraine crisis, analysts said.

VTB's second-quarter net profit, to be reported on Thursday, is expected to be 12.8 billion roubles ($350 million), according to the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts, up from 11.9 billion in the same period of 2013. The state-controlled bank's profit plunged to 400 million roubles in the first three months of the year as a slowing economy and geopolitical tensions over Ukraine hurt its performance.

[ID:nL6N0Q66BH] "We expect good growth in [VTB's] corporate lending thanks to demand from Russian borrowers due to limited access to external markets," Gazprombank analyst Andrey Klapko said. "But VTB will also top up its reserves for its retail portfolio and for certain corporate borrowers because of the deteriorating situation in the economy." Klapko said VTB's net interest margin would likely fall to 4.2 percent from 4.5 in the previous quarter, mainly since the central bank has raised its key interest rate since the bank last reported.
