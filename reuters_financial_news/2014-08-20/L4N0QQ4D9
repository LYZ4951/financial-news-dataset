LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Investor requests to pull out money from hedge funds rose in August, according to data released on Wednesday, an increase typically seen at this time of year.

The SS&C <SSNC.O> GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator, a snapshot of hedge fund clients giving notice to withdraw cash expressed as a percentage of assets under administration, rose to 4.19 percent in August from 3.15 percent in July. "Redemption notifications increased by about 1 percent for the month, but remain moderate and in line with activity this time last year," said Bill Stone, chairman and chief executive officer, SS&C Technologies. Exit requests have risen during August from the previous month every year since 2009, the data showed.
