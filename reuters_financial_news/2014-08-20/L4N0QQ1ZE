SEOUL, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> <KRW=KFTC> fell on Wednesday after strong U.S housing data propelled the dollar higher against a broad range of currencies.

The won was quoted at 1,022.7 per dollar at the conclusion of domestic trade, snapping a three-day winning streak that drove it to a 5-week intraday high on Monday. In the equities market, the benchmark KOSPI <.KS11> index ticked 0.08 percent higher to close at 2,072.78 points after treading water for most of the session, as investors adopted a wait-and-see stance ahead of the scheduled release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.
