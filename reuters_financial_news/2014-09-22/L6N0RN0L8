LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - British private equity firm Electra <ELTA.L> has rejected calls from activist investor Edward Bramson's Sherborne Investors to review its strategy and elect Bramson to the board.

Sherborne said in a letter last week that a revamp of Electra could create over one billion pounds ($1.6 billion) of shareholder value. However, Electra criticised the proposal, saying it lacked detail on how the gains would be achieved. [ID:nL6N0RI3I5]  "The Board of Directors of Electra believes that Sherborne's Letter contains unverifiable statements and unsubstantiated claims," Electra said on Monday.  "Sherborne's strategic review would have a deeply destabilising effect and risks disrupting the continuation of this highly successful track record and destroying significant shareholder value."
