MUMBAI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose modestly on Monday to notch their fourth consecutive session of gains, led by blue-chips that have under-performed recently, such as Tata Motors and Oil and Natural Gas Corp, although the mood was broadly cautious.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed up 0.4 percent at 27,206.74 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> gained 0.31 percent to 8,146.30.
