DUBAI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Burgan Bank <BURG.KW> set initial price guidance for a Tier 1 capital-boosting bond in the area of low/mid seven percent on Monday, according to lead managers.

The bond with a perpetual tenor can be bought back by the lender after the fifth year, and will be benchmark-sized, traditionally understood to mean upwards of $500 million, a document showed. The lender, the Gulf Arab state's third-largest by assets, held roadshows in Asia, the United Arab Emirates and Europe in early September and had said would issue a bond subject to market conditions. [ID:nL5N0QY3B4] The investor meetings were arranged by HSBC <HSBA.L> as global coordinator and Citi <C.N>, JP Morgan <JPM.N> and National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> as lead managers.
