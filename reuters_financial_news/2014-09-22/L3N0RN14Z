HONG KONG, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <BABA.N> and some of its shareholders have sold an additional 48 million shares, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said on Monday, making its IPO the biggest-ever globally at a value of $25.03 billion.

The move comes after the stock surged 38 percent in its debut on Friday as investors jostled for a piece of the e-commerce company. [ID:nL1N0RK0U9] Alibaba and several shareholders initially sold 320.1 million American Depositary Shares in its offering, which priced at $68 each last week. Underwriters had the option to sell additional shares from Alibaba, Yahoo Inc <YHOO.O> and Alibaba co-founders Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, according to the IPO prospectus.
