SYDNEY, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares are expected to see a tentative start on Tuesday after sliding to five-month lows in the previous session, with overnight weakness on Wall Street and a continued slump in iron ore prices likely to drag on the market.

Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.1 percent, an 11-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark declined 1.3 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since early August.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 0.1 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks closed lower overnight, with the S&P 500 suffering its biggest one-day decline since early August, as the latest housing data came in much weaker than expected, raising new concerns about the rate of growth in the economy. * Chinese steel and iron ore futures slid 4 percent to their lowest on record on Monday, plagued by worries about excess supply at a time when demand for both in the world's top consumer is growing at a slower pace. * Investors will also closely eye Chinese HSBC Manufacturing Flash PMI due out later in the day for catalysts. * New Hope Corp Ltd <NHC.AX> says its full year net profit is A$58.5 million versus A$74.1 million.
