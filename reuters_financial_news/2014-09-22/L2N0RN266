WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Monday it will take several actions against corporate tax-avoidance deals known as "inversions" by reducing the tax benefits accessible to inverted companies and by making inversions more difficult to do.

The effective date for the new inversion rules is Monday, said a senior Treasury official on a conference call with reporters.
