Sept 22 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Atlantic City's general obligation bonds to 'BBB-plus' from 'A-minus', citing liquidity pressures following the closure of 4 of the 12 casinos in the city in New Jersey.

"We believe that these closures will have a substantial impact on the city's revenue structure given the city's tax base concentration, with 12 casinos representing 56 percent of 2014 assessed value," S&P said.
