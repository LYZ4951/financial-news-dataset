BERLIN, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's chief economist rebuffed criticism that it was actively seeking to depress the euro exchange rate and that the currency's level reflected the economic situation in the euro zone.

"There is no willingness to talk down the euro," ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet told an audience at a banking event in Berlin on Monday.
