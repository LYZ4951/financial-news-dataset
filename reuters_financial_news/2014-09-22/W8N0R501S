WARSAW, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank will most likely cut interest rates in October, but there is no need for radical moves in monetary policy as there are no signals of a deeper economic slowdown, rate-setter Jerzy Hausner was quoted as saying on Monday.

Hausner told state agency PAP that any "radical moves" on rates would not increase economic growth, which he estimates at about 3 percent in the coming quarters.
