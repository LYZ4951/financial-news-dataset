JERUSALEM, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel kept its benchmark interest rate <ILINR=ECI> at 0.25 percent on Monday, taking a pause in its easing cycle after disinflation and weakening economic growth led to  surprise rate reductions the past two months.

All 11 economists polled by Reuters had forecast no move despite signs of further economic slowing the past month. It had cut the key rate in both July and August to a new all-time low. Growth in the second quarter was revised to an annualised rate of 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent, while Israel's inflation rate eased to zero in August.
