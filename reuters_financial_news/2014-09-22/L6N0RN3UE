NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake is in advanced talks to acquire Shutterfly Inc <SFLY.O>, the online photo-sharing services provider, for at least $2 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Silver Lake is in discussions to pay more than $50 per share for Shutterfly, although the deal price has yet to be finalized, one of the people said.
