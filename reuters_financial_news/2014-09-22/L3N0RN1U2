SEOUL, Sept 22 (Reuters) - South Korean shares fell on Monday, weighed down by broad declines in large-cap technology shares, tracking Friday's losses in its Wall Street counterparts.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.71 percent at 2,039.27 points. Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> fell 1.8 percent while chipmaker SK Hynix <000660.KS> slid 1.7 percent. They are respectively the first- and third-largest listings on the main bourse by market capitalisation.  The South Korean won <KRW=> rose against the dollar to rebound from a fresh 5-month intraday low on Friday, after ratings agency Standard & Poor's upgraded South Korea's sovereign credit outlook from stable to positive.   The won found further support from profit-taking on the dollar as investors cashed out on the latest rally in the greenback.
