WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly fell in August as investors stepped away from the market, but the decline probably does not signal renewed weakness in the housing sector.

The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. The decline followed four straight months of gains and the sales pace was still the second highest for the year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales increasing  to a 5.20 million-unit pace. Compared to August last year, sales were down 5.3 percent.
