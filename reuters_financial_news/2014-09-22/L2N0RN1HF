NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Monday he hopes the U.S. Congress will soon pass immigration reform, a move that would ease tensions on both sides of the border.

Pena Nieto, speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting, said he respects the U.S. political process but hopes migratory reform hurdles are solved, and a change materializes soon.
