PARIS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A French appeals court ruled on Monday Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> must deposit a guarantee of 1.1 billion euros (1.41 billion US dollars) in an investigation of charges that it helped wealthy French customers avoid tax, the prosecutor's office said.

The Zurich-based bank was put under formal investigation in July on allegations it laundered the proceeds of tax evasion. French judges have requested the payment, saying it reflects the size of the fine UBS could pay if it is found guilty.
