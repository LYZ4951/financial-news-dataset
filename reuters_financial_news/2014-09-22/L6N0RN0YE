STOCKHOLM, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Consolidation is not on the agenda for Sweden's top telecoms operators despite persistant market speculation to the contrary, the country's number two firm Tele2 <TEL2b.ST> said in a Reuters interview.

Four companies dominate the Swedish market, serving a country of only about ten million people, but instead of mergers or acquistions they are instead relying on network cooperation to keep costs down. "Noone is pushing towards that (consolidation), although it might happen to smaller players," said Thomas Ekman, head of Tele2's Swedish operations. Market leader TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST>, runner-up Tele2, third-placed Telenor <TEL.OL> and fourth-placed operator "3" <INVEb.ST><0013.HK> have relatively extensive network-sharing agreements that help keep margins healthy. "We have already consolidated our networks with each other," Ekman said. Tele2 Chief Executive Mats Granryd has previously said the company would be a buyer rather than a seller if consolidation were to take place in the Swedish market.  DATA BRINGS NEW REVENUE PATTERN Operators have recently shifted their business models from voice to data as the main driver of revenues. In the second quarter, Tele2 Sweden's underlying sales grew by four percent, up from three percent in the previous two quarters, and the company said in July it views the new rate as sustainable. [ID:nWEB00PPN] Ekman said there will be variations around the four percent growth rate, as data will bring new seasonal variations, and that it's premature to predict these cycles.  "I can see a tentative pattern, which could materialise, with top-ups of data (clients buying extra data) having roughly the same cycles as pre-paid which has been strong in the summer-time," he added. Tele2's clients consumed big chunks of data in June this year, helped by the FIFA World Cup, and the second quarter also saw a boost from the company's temporary offer of films and television series from U.S. television channel HBO. Ekman predicted solid demand for Apple's iPhone 6 models, which are set to be released in Sweden on Sept. 26, adding it was hard to judge the probability of price wars among operators when launching subscriptions with the new phones. "The market is currently in an OK situation. Price pressure is hard, mainly from the sub-brands," he said, referring to low price brands which all four major operators now have launched to attract customers concerned with keeping cost low.
