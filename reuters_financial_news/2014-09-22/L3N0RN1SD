* The market debut of the Alibaba Group <BABA.N>, the Chinese Internet titan, hit the stock markets like a meteor last week, and thanks to $500 million in investments made in Alibaba in 2011 and 2012, American investment firm Silver Lake now sits on a stake worth more than $5.1 billion, after having reaped $278.8 million by selling a fraction of its holdings.(http://nyti.ms/1tRanG0)  *  Industrial conglomerate Siemens AG <SIEGn.DE> said late on Sunday it would buy U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc <DRC.N> for $7.6 billion, including the assumption of debt. (http://nyti.ms/1wExBi1)  * EMC Corp <EMC.N>, the computer storage company now facing pressure from a big activist hedge fund, had held discussions with Hewlett-Packard <HPQ.N> about a merger, though those talks have since ended, a person briefed on the matter said on Sunday.

Pinterest has forged close relationships with magazines, especially those focused on women, who make up 71 percent of Pinterest users. It is a leading driver of traffic to certain magazines, and in some cases - like Self - it serves as a bigger source of reader referrals than either Facebook Inc <FB.O> or Twitter Inc <TWTR.N>.
