HONG KONG, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares slumped to two-month lows on Monday, as investors fretted that a preliminary factory survey on Tuesday could provide more evidence of a slowdown in China.

China shares suffered a further blow with 12 initial public offerings (IPOs) starting to take subscriptions this week. That is expected to lock up 600 billion yuan ($97.75 billion) in funds, according to a National Business Daily report, aggravating quarter-end liquidity pressures. At midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was off 1.3 percent at 23,983.82 points, lowest since July 23. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong slid 1.8 percent to its lowest since July 22.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings fell 1.7 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was down 1.5 percent at 2,294.91 points.  "The markets are under pressure as people expect tomorrow's HSBC flash manufacturing managers' index (PMI) won't be good," said Zhang Yanbin, an analyst from Zheshang Securities in Shanghai. "The IPOs are also diverting money from the market." China's September flash manufacturing PMI reading on Tuesday could come in below the 50 level, indicating that manufacturing activity is contracting. The median of a Reuters poll was 50.0, which is the demarcation point between expansion and contraction.   China will not dramatically alter its economic policy because of any one economic indicator, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said on Sunday. His remarks came days after many economists lowered growth forecasts following the latest set of weak data. [ID:nL3N0RM06E] Index heavyweights were battered.
