LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A former senior executive of Russian investment bank VTB Capital has launched Gemcorp, an emerging market fund which has so far raised $500 million from European institutional investors.

Atanas Bostandjiev, a former partner at Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, said London-headquartered Gemcorp would aim to invest in emerging market companies requiring debt and equity, and would have a lock-up period of five years.  The firm will focus on financial services, natural resources, infrastructure and sovereign sectors.
