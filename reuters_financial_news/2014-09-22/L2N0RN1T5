RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Brazil's financial markets slumped on Monday on growing uncertainty about the outcome of the October presidential elections, while concern about China's economic slowdown weighed on Latin American markets in general.

The Brazilian real <BRL=> weakened more than 1 percent to near 2.4 per dollar while the benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> lost about 2.5 percent as investors grew jittery about a series of election polls due this week. Investors fear President Dilma Rousseff, who they accuse of failing to keep inflation at bay while driving the economy into a recession, may gain ground in the surveys, the first one due after markets close on Monday. "Electoral speculation is at full tilt ahead of the upcoming opinion polls and all the indications are that the race is becoming more competitive," said Raphael Figueredo, an analyst with Clear brokerage in Brazil. "That increases volatility." Rousseff had already clawed back some support at the expense of her main opponent in the latest Datafolha poll released on Friday, causing stocks and the real to fall. [ID:nL1N0RK0D4] The real's steep decline, which took the currency to its weakest levels in seven months, increased market speculation that the central bank may be ready to step up intervention in the foreign exchange market. Market losses were exacerbated by comments made by China's Finance Minister Lou Jiwei, who said the government will not dramatically alter economic policy because of one economic indicator, even as many economists lowered their growth forecasts for the world's No.2 economy. [ID:nL3N0RM06E] The Chilean peso <CLP=> lost 0.8 percent to close at 601.00 per dollar, crossing the 600-per-dollar threshold for the first time since April 2009, as copper prices dropped to a three-month low on Chinese concerns. Copper is Chile's main export product.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GRAPHICS: Emerging market FX 2014 performance: http://link.reuters.com/jus35t MSCI emerging index 2014 performance: http://link.reuters.com/weh36s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  Key Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 2000 GMT:   Stock indexes   daily %YTD %   change   change   LatestMSCI Emerging  1039,66-1,35 5,11  Markets <.MSCIEF>  MSCI LatAm 3332,82-2,14  6,4  <.MILA00000PUS>Brazil Bovespa56763,79-1,7710,21  <.BVSP>Mexico IPC45305,81   -1 6,04  <.MXX> Chile IPSA 3999,34-0,73 8,11  <.IPSA>Chile IGPA19439,43-0,58 6,65  <.IGPA>Argentina MerVal  12006,05 3,67   122,70  <.MERV>Colombia IGBC 14114,34-0,46 7,98  <.IGBC>Peru IGRA 16748,51-1,14 6,32  <.IGRA>Venezuela IBC  2781,51  0,1 1,64  <.IBC>   Currencies  daily %YTD %   change   change  Latest Brazil real 2,3925-0,88-1,49  <BRBY> Mexico peso 13,266-0,40-1,78  <MXN=> Chile peso 601-0,78   -12,46  <CLP=CL>   Colombia peso   1995,8-1,20-3,20  <COP=> Peru sol 2,871-0,21-2,72  <PEN=PE>   Argentina peso  8,4275-0,03   -22,96  (interbank)<ARS=RASL> Argentina peso15,1-0,66   -33,77  (parallel) <ARSB=>
