ZURICH, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Swiss pump maker Sulzer <SUN.S> said it had ended talks over a merger with Dresser-Rand Group Inc <DRC.N> after Germany's Siemens <SIEGn.DE> offered to buy the U.S. oilfield equipment maker for $7.6 billion.

"Sulzer has terminated the talks with Dresser-Rand," Sulzer spokesman Verena Goelkel said in an emailed statement on Monday. The Swiss firm, which is controlled by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, had said last week it was in non-exclusive talks with Dresser-Rand. [ID:nL6N0RI400] Siemens said earlier on Monday it was offering $7.6 billion for Dresser-Rand. The Financial Times said on Friday General Electric <GE.N> may also be mulling a bid. [ID:nL6N0RN00I]
