WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A unit of Wells Fargo <WFC.N> will admit to wrongdoing and pay a $5 million penalty to settle charges that it failed to have adequate controls in place to prevent an employee from illegal insider-trading, U.S. regulators said Monday.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said that Wells Fargo Advisors LLC did not have proper controls, unreasonably delayed producing documents during the SEC's probe, and provided an "altered document" related to a compliance review of the broker's trading.
