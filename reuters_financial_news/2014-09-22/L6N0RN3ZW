MADRID, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Banco Popular <POP.MC> said on Monday it had signed a definitive agreement to buy Citi's <C.N> retail banking and credit card business in Spain for 238.5 million euros.

Popular and Citi had been in talks over the units, including 45 branch offices, as foreign players struggling to compete with local banks in the wake of a financial crisis exit the country. [ID:nL5N0MW1E8]
