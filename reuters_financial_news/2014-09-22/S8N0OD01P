HONG KONG, Sept 22 (Reuters) - China shares tumbled on Monday as a new batch of initial public offerings started taking subscriptions while investors worried that a flash manufacturing survey due on Tuesday could be more evidence the Chinese economy is slowing significantly.

The wave of 12 IPOs is expected to lock up 600 billion yuan ($97.75 billion) in funds, according to a National Business Daily report, aggravating quarter-end liquidity pressures. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> shed 1.7 percent to 2,289.87 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings closed down 1.9 percent.
