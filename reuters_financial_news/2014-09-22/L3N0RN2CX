LONDON Sept 22 (Reuters) - Shares in London-listed miner Bellzone <BZM.L> were suspended on Monday due to financial uncertainty after the company failed to agree with a Chinese partner on a vital loan, lack of which threatens to sink the miner.

The Guinea-focused iron more miner had agreed on Aug. 18 on a short-term loan of up to $4 million with China Sonangol International, which was expected to provide Bellzone with enough capital to continue operations until late October. Bellzone, like other small mining companies in West Africa, has been battered by plunging iron ore prices and the Ebola epidemic.

The company said it only has funds to continue operations until mid-September.
