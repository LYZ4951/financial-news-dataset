NAIROBI, July 16 (Reuters) - Kenyan mortgage firm Housing Finance <HFCK.NR> posted an 18 percent leap in pretax profit for the first half to 677.78 million shillings ($7.72 million), thanks to a surge in non-interest income, it said on Wednesday.

Non-interest income jumped 241 percent to 506.29 million shillings during the period, driven by the firm's building and insurance subsidiaries, Housing Finance said.
