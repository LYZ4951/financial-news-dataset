LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Experian <EXPN.L> said 11.1 percent of shareholders had voted against the re-election of Don Robert as a director of the company, following opposition to his move to become chairman having previously been chief executive.

Roberts' elevation, which enables chief financial officer Brian Cassin to take over as CEO at the world's biggest credit checking company, directly contravenes Britain's Corporate Governance Code and has been opposed by the Investment Management Association and Institute of Directors.
