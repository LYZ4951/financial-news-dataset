LAGOS, July 16 (Reuters) - The Nigerian currency was unchanged at 161.90 naira <NGN=D1> to the U.S. dollar at Wednesday's market close, supported by inflows from offshore investors participating at a government debt auction, amid lower dollar demand, dealers said.

The naira closed at the same level as the previous day, remaining at a 7-week high it touched against the U.S. currency on Tuesday. "The market remains very liquid to support the naira," one dealer said. Nigeria sold 100 billion naira ($617.8 mln) in bonds at an auction on Wednesday. Auction result are expected on Thursday.
