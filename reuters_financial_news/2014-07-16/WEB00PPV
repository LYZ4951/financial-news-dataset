STOCKHOLM, July 16 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank could cut rates further, but unless measures are taken to curb rising household debt monetary policy may then have to tighten faster than forecast, Governor Stefan Ingves said in the minutes of latest Riksbank rate-setting meeting.

"If it were the case that monetary policy needed to be even more expansionary, the Executive Board of the Riksbank may decide to cut the repo rate down to the zero lower bound," Ingves said in the minutes, published on Wednesday. Ingves, who voted wanted a 25 basis point cut earlier this month rather than the 50 basis points agreed by the board, said this was not currently necessary, adding macroprudential steps were urgently needed to slow rising household debt levels. "If this does not happen, the repo rate may need to be raised faster than is currently being assumed," he said.  Earlier this month, the central bank cut its key repo rate to 0.25 percent from 0.75 percent - a bigger cut than expected - to try and lift inflation toward a 2 percent target. It also pushed out its forecast for when interest rates will start to rise to the end of next year and indicated a small chance that rates could be cut before year end. [ID:nL6N0PE1PE]
