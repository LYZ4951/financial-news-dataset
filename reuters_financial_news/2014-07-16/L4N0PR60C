July 17 (Reuters) - Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O> is in advanced talks to buy British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc's <BSY.L> remaining 7.2 percent stake in Britain's biggest commercial free-to-air broadcaster ITV Plc, Sky News reported late on Wednesday.

The deal is likely to be announced on Thursday, Sky said on its website, adding that there was a "slim possibility" that the stake would go to institutional investors if talks fell through. (http://bit.ly/1oYX0Ad) ITV's London-listed shares closed at 183 pence on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of about 7.4 billion pounds ($12.68 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data.  Representatives of BSkyB, Liberty Global and ITV could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.
