July 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned A.R.T.S. Ltd.'s (ARTS)  Tranche 37 and 38 final ratings of 'A-', with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also  affirmed the outstanding Tranche 24, 28, 29, 30 33, 34, 35 and 36 at 'A-' with a  Stable Outlook, following the issue of new debt.  The agency has not assigned ratings to the other outstanding tranches (Tranche  21, 25, 26, 27, 31 and 32) but has considered their impact on the whole  diversified payment rights (DPRs) programme in its rating analysis. ARTS is a future flow transaction of DPRs originated by Akbank T.A.S. <AKBNK.IS> (Akbank,  BBB-/Stable/F3). DPRs are essentially payment orders processed by banks, which  can arise for a variety of reasons but mainly reflect payments due on the export  of goods and services, capital flows and personal remittances. ARTS has  purchased all present and future US dollar-, euro-, UK pound- and Swiss  franc-denominated DPRs from Akbank, financed through issued debt backed by the  DPRs. The programme has been in existence since 1999.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  GCA Score Supports Rating Fitch has a Going Concern Assessment (GCA) score of GC1 on Akbank, based on its  position as the fourth-largest (third-largest privately owned) bank in the  financial system and its role in the Turkish economy. Akbank had unconsolidated  assets of USD87.5bn as of March 2014, representing about 11.1% of total assets  of banks in the financial system according to the Banks Association of Turkey.  Three-Notch Uplift The GC1 enables Fitch to apply a three-notch uplift on ARTS' ratings over  Akbank's local currency IDR of 'BBB-', supported by the stability, strength and  diversification of the flows, size of the total outstanding notes relative to  Akbank's overall indebtedness, strong debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs) and  Akbank's sound standalone profile.  Sovereign Risk Mitigated When contemplating ratings above a country's Long-Term IDR, Fitch considers  potential sovereign risk events consistent with the rating. These risks include  transfer and convertibility, devaluation and, to some degree, nationalisation  and expropriation.  Any controls on transfer or conversion of foreign exchange are mitigated in this  transaction, as payments from the obligors are collected offshore. Fitch  evaluated the potential for payment-diversion risk in this transaction and  believes this risk is mitigated on several levels such as acknowledgement  agreements signed by specified correspondent banks.  High Proportion of Domestic Flow Domestic flows, remittances initiated by payers in Turkey, make up about half of  the total collections. Fitch views the domestic flows as susceptible to  sovereign interference and therefore they are excluded from Fitch's DSCR  calculation. However, the transaction allows some credit to domestic flows in  calculating the DSCR.  Strong DSCRs Fitch expects the monthly adjusted collections' DSCRs for the programme to be  about 133x. This is well above the early amortisation triggers. Fitch's analysis  considers only offshore DPR flows processed through specified deposit accounts;  whereas the transaction's adjusted DSCR definition gives partial credit to  domestic collections, in parallel with the tested DSCR concept for comparable  transactions. The agency also applies concentration-, FX- and interest-rate stresses  commensurate with a 'A-' rating, to test the adequacy of coverage under various  scenarios. The DSCRs are high and above the key trigger levels that are set out  in the transaction documents.  Moderate Programme Size Fitch estimates the new series, in combination with the existing tranches to  date, represent about 2.7% of Akbank's total liabilities and 6.2% of total  liabilities excluding customer deposits. Fitch considers current leverage  reasonable.   True Sale and Acknowledgements ARTS is a special-purpose corporation (SPC) and has entered into a remittances  purchase agreement with the originator (Akbank) to purchase all rights to, title  to, and interest in existing and future DPRs of the originator. The SPC is  located in Jersey and not owned or controlled by Akbank. Selected correspondent  banks have executed acknowledgement agreements, giving the security trustee  control over flows from these correspondent banks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The most significant variables affecting the transaction's rating are Akbank's  credit quality, its GCA score, and the sovereign rating (BBB-/Stable). Although  coverage levels are also a key input, the DSCRs have been high, and therefore  the transaction is expected to be able to withstand a significant decline in  cash flows without it affecting the ratings. Nevertheless, Fitch will analyse  any change in any of these variables to assess the possible impact on the  transaction's ratings.
