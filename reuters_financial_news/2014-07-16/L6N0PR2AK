DUBLIN, July 16 (Reuters) - Ireland's commitment that its "bad bank" will repay the bulk of its debt two years ahead of schedule will enhance the potential value of state-owned Allied Irish Banks <ALBK.I>, finance minister Michael Noonan said.

Ireland's National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) plans to repay a minimum of 80 percent of its senior debt by the end of 2016, two years earlier than planned, a government review of the state-run "bad bank" said on Wednesday.
