DUBAI, July 16 (Reuters) - National Bank of Kuwait <NBKK.KW>, the Gulf Arab state's largest commercial lender, reported a 29 percent rise in second-quarter profit on Wednesday but missed analysts' estimates.

Net profit climbed to 60.9 million dinars ($215.8 million) in the three months to June 30 from 47.2 million dinars a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on the bank's first-half financial statement. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted 74.8 million dinars profit on average. [ID:nL6N0PP0YS]
