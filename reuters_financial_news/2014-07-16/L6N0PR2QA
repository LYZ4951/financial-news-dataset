LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - European equity markets recovered on Wednesday from losses in the previous session as a rebound in Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> and in mining stocks lifted the region's bourses.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which had slipped 0.4 percent on Tuesday, was up 1.2 percent at 1,375.14 points. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index <.STOXX50E> rose 1.4 percent to 3,197.81 points. Banco Espirito Santo (BES) jumped 15 percent, after hitting record lows on Tuesday, enabling Lisbon's benchmark PSI-20 index <.PSI20> to advance by 2.7 percent. Traders said that even though BES remained dogged by the fact that a holding company of the bank's founding family had failed to repay a $1 billion loan, some investors were now starting to think the stock represented a relative bargain. They added that BES was also benefiting from an extension to a ban on short-selling on its shares - or betting on future falls in a share price - and from expectations among investors that it could raise more capital if necessary. "It's a storm in a teacup. It's something that is specific to Portugal, rather than having broader repercussions across the euro zone," said Terry Torrison, managing director at Monaco-based McLaren Securities.  MINING STOCKS RISE Shares in planemaker Airbus <AIR.PA> fell, which traders attributed to Qatar Airways' decision to seek compensation from Airbus for delays in delivery of three of the European planemaker's A380 superjumbos. [ID:nL6N0PQ5IJ]  However, mining stocks rallied after Chinese economic growth data slightly beat expectations, hinting at resilient demand in the world's largest metals consumer. The STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index <.SXPP> - which houses mining companies - rose 2.6 percent, beating a 1.2 percent rise on the broader, pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX>. China, the world's second-largest economy, grew 7.5 percent in April-June from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said on Wednesday, just ahead of a median forecast of 7.4 percent in a Reuters poll. [ID:nL4N0PR083] "It confirms the trend we've seen from improving PMI data, and is in line with the idea of a pick-up in the global economy," Coutts global equity strategist James Butterfill said. "There's a close correlation between Chinese industrial production and the mining sector, so this pick-up is encouraging." The FTSEurofirst 300 is still up around 3 percent since the start of 2014, while the Euro STOXX 50 is up around 2 percent.
