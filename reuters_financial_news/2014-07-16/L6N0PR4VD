BERLIN, July 16 (Reuters) - The euro zone debt crisis could flare up again quickly if governments do not use time the European Central Bank has bought them to reform their economies and consolidate their budgets, ECB policymaker Jens Weidmann said.

"Monetary policy has bought the governments time to implement structural reforms and consolidate budgets - partly by stretching its mandate," he told Germany's Die Welt newspaper in an interview released on Wednesday.
