July 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Long-Term  Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of 'A-' to Nomura  Financial Products & Services, Inc. (NFPS). The Rating Outlook is Stable. The  agency has also assigned the company Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs  of 'F1' and a Support Rating (SR) of '1'. NFPS, a registered brokerage firm established in 2011, is a fully owned  subsidiary of Nomura Holdings, Inc. <8604.T> (NHI) and is supervised by Japan's Financial  Services Agency (JFSA) in a consolidated framework for the entire Nomura group  under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs AND SR NFPS's IDRs and SR reflect its level of integration with NHI and core  responsibility within the group. In Fitch's view, there is an extremely high  probability that NFPS would be supported by NHI, if required. Fitch believes  that a high degree of integration in operation, including management, underlines  the parent's strong commitment to NFPS.  NFPS's Long-Term IDRs are aligned with NHI's support-driven IDRs (A-/Stable)  based on the entity's importance to the parent. NFPS performs a central role in  the group by providing a platform to book multiple-currency transactions by the  group's global wholesale unit, which generated approximately half of NHI's  consolidated net operating revenues in the year ended March 2014. NHI aims to  transfer a majority of its risks generated from trading in the group's global  wholesale business, particularly in Europe, to NFPS. Therefore, NFPS's failure,  if such an event occurs, would lead to severe disruption in the group's  operations domestically and globally. Fitch considers the Nomura group to be systemically important to the Japanese  economy, such that its failure would have a significant impact on the local  financial market. As a consequence, if the group faced severe financial  difficulties, including through stress arising from NFPS, the government is  highly likely to support NHI, with such support likely to flow through to NFPS,  if required.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs AND SR NFPS's IDRs would be directly affected by changes to NHI's IDRs, which are  underpinned by the Support Rating Floor (SRF) at 'A-'. The support-driven IDRs  are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assessment of the Japanese government's  propensity to support, and/or of the systemic importance of NHI derived from  factors such as increased substitutability due to its downsizing of operations  and/or transactions. Nevertheless, NHI's SR of '1' and SRF are likely to remain  unchanged even if Japan's sovereign rating (A+/ Negative) is downgraded by one  notch to 'A'.  The upgrade of NFPS's Long-Term IDRs will be driven by the upgrade of NHI's  Viability Rating (VR) of 'bbb' by more than two notches. However, Fitch  considers such an upgrade to be remote, given the modest improvement in the  operating environment with no clear evidence of the sustainability of the  economic policies set forth under Abenomics.  The downgrade of NFPS's SR and IDRs would be considered if its functions within  the group were to be substantially revised, and its position as an integral part  of the group was to recede. Also, a decrease in NHI's propensity to support its  subsidiary due to reduced ownership would result in the downgrade of NFPS's SR  and IDRs.
