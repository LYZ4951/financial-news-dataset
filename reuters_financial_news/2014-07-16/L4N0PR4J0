July 16 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> has offered $13 billion to settle a probe into mortgage securities sold by the bank, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The bank met U.S. Justice Department representatives on Tuesday, but no progress was made toward a final deal, the paper reported.
