WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - The United States warned on Wednesday that it could expand the scope and target list of its new sanctions against Russia if Moscow continues "provocative" behavior in Ukraine.

A senior U.S. administration official told reporters on a conference call that the sanctions were also designed to avoid spillover risk for the global economy.
