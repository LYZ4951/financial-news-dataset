DUBAI, July 16 (Reuters) - Dubai's stock market may rise again on Wednesday if contractor Arabtec <ARTC.DU>, which soared in the last session, keeps its momentum.

Shares in Arabtec jumped 13.6 percent to 4.86 dirhams on Tuesday, accounting for most of the turnover on the Dubai bourse <.DFMGI>, which gained 3.4 percent. Analysts' estimates suggest Arabtec is once again well above fair value; the median target price of eight analysts surveyed by Reuters is 3.68 dirhams. However, the stock has regained the interest of retail investors, who are hoping for strong second-quarter earnings at the company and possibly a decision by major shareholder Aabar Investments to raise its stake. So it may remain strong. Arabtec's leap helped Dubai trigger an inverse head & shoulders pattern formed by the late June and early July lows, and pointing back up to May's multi-year peak of 5,407 points, which is strong resistance. Elsewhere in the region, Qatari Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan <MARK.QA> may rise after it said it had sold a stake in a local real estate firm to a state fund for 1.53 billion riyals ($420 million), which would generate a gain of 466 million riyals for the bank spread over three years. [ID:nL6N0PQ4AU] The stock, which usually dominates trading on Qatar's bourse <.QSI>, was suspended on Tuesday pending the announcement. Saudi Arabian Mining Co <1211.SE> (Ma'aden) also looks likely to gain after it posted a higher-than-expected nine-fold rise in net profit in the second quarter. [ID:nL6N0PQ4EK] Hospital management firm Al Hammadi Company for Development and Investment <4007.SE> could make further gains after jumping its daily 10 percent limit on its first day of trading. Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, on the other hand, may pull back after trimming its proposed cash dividend for the first half of 2014 to 1.0 riyal per share from 1.38 riyals a year earlier as its second-quarter earnings fell 8.2 percent.
