HONG KONG, July 16 (Reuters) - China shares posted their first losses in four sessions on Wednesday, as investors rotated out of recent outperformers ahead of a new batch of initial public offerings (IPOs).

Investors largely shrugged off the announcement that China's economy grew slightly faster than expected in the second quarter. Analysts said Beijing will likely need to offer further support to meet its growth target for 2014.
