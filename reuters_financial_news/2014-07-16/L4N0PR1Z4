July 16 (Reuters) - Indonesian stocks rose on Wednesday, led by shares of large cap companies on hopes that Joko "Jokowi" Widodo would win the presidential poll and find a friendlier parliament that may help push through a reform agenda.

Other Southeast Asian markets mostly gained after China reported economic growth that was just ahead of market expectations. [ID:nL4N0PR083] The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> was up 1.2 percent by 0659 GMT, hovering around its highest since July 10, led by financials. Political newsflow on the real vote count continues to point toward Jokowi winning the election, analysts at broker Trimegah Securities wrote in a market strategy report. Gains were led by a 2 percent rise each in Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK> and Astra International <ASII.JK>. Shares in Kalbe Farma <KLBF.JK> gained 3.8 percent. Optimism around a possible win for Jakarta Governor Jokowi, seen as more market friendly, had sent stocks to an over-13-month high on Thursday, the day after the election. On Tuesday, several members of Indonesia's second-largest political party said they were considering joining Jokowi's camp, which could lead to a friendlier parliament that would help push through a reform agenda in Southeast Asia's largest economy.

The Thai stock index <.SETI> was at a more than 13-month- high with analysts expecting further consolidation. Singapore shares <.FTSTI> were up 0.2 percent. Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> was trading 0.7 percent up after a Chinese oil rig completed exploration on disputed waters and was being relocated, a move that could reduce ongoing tensions with Vietnam.
