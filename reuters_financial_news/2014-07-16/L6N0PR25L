LISBON, July 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> recovered from Tuesday's record lows with a near-20 percent bounce in early Wednesday trading, with analysts citing bottom-fishing even after a holding company of the bank's founding family failed to repay a $1 billion loan.

"There is no positive news out there today to lift BES, just the continuation or confirmation of yesterday's bad news, so it's most likely a correction after a very violent slump of over 60 percent in the past month," said Andre Rodrigues, an analyst at Caixa BI. Fincor analyst Albino Oliveira added: "There must be investors there counting that most of the impact is already priced in and it's time to buy."
