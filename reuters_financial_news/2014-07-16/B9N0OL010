SHANGHAI, July 16 (Reuters) - Huatong Road & Bridge Group Co Ltd, a construction firm in China, said on Wednesday it might fail to pay investors both interest and principal due on a one-year short-term bill issue that matures on July 23.

In a statement on the website of the official Shanghai Clearing House, the company warned that payments of both interest and principal on the issue <CN041365009=> are uncertain because its chairman is currently "assisting an official investigation". If a default occurs, it would be the first public bond default in China's interbank market, the country's largest bond market, and would also be the first time a Chinese company is publicly known to have defaulted on both interest and principal due on a bond. China's first publicly-known default was in March when Chaori Solar defaulted on interest payments due on a bond issued on the Shenzhen exchange, a far smaller venue. Huatong issued 400 million yuan ($64.48 million) in one-year short-term bills in July last year.
