MUMBAI, July 16 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday as lenders and infrastructure-related shares such as IDFC Ltd <IDFC.NS> surged after the central bank exempted long-term bonds raised for the sector from reserve requirements.

IDFC provisionally rose 8.9 percent, while ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> ended higher 5.1 percent.
