SEOUL, July 16 (Reuters) - South Korea's finance minister Choi Kyung-hwan said on Wednesday there are no current plans for a supplementary budget but that the government would aim instead for an expansionary budget  next year.

"Instead of a supplementary budget, we will aim to reinforce our financial means through a variety of ways as the current economic situation is very bad," Choi said in a media conference after his inauguration.
