WASHINGTON, July 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced late Wednesday it will meet July 23 to vote on final rules aimed at reducing investor risk in money market mutual funds.

The SEC did not disclose details on how the rule will look. Reuters previously reported the agency is leaning toward adopting two measures that will require prime funds to switch from a stable $1 per share net asset value to a floating NAV, and also permit fund boards to impose gates or fees on redemptions.
