NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday, on a fresh round of merger news, as investors digested the latest batch of corporate earnings.

* Merger and acquisition activity continued to thrive on Wall Street. Time Warner <TWX.N> shares jumped 15.3 percent to $81.86 before the bell as Twenty-First Century Fox <FOXA.O> confirmed it made an $80 billion takeover offer for the company that was turned down. [ID:nL4N0PR3L0] <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Morning Call:  Murdoch wants Time Warner - report: http://reut.rs/1mKZuCz ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> * A partnership struck between IBM <IBM.N> and Apple Inc <AAPL.O> will serve to boost indexes. A deal was struck between the tech giants, in which IBM will exclusively sell iPhones and iPads loaded with applications geared at enterprise clients this fall. IBM shares gained 1.8 percent to $191.85 and Apple advanced 2.1 percent to $97.35 in premarket. [ID:nL2N0PQ2J0] * Also supporting gains was chipmaker Intel <INTC.O>, which rose 5.1 percent to $33.32 in premarket following second-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates. The company also forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street's expectations. [ID:nL2N0PQ2A3] * Bank of America <BAC.N> shed 0.6 percent to $15.67 in premarket after the second-largest U.S. bank by assets reported a 43 percent drop in second-quarter profit as mortgage revenue fell and litigation costs increased. [ID:nL4N0PR3H0]  * Yahoo <YHOO.O> shares also declined in premarket, down 2.3 percent to $34.79 after its disappointing second-quarter results and outlook, although the company pledged to pay its shareholders at least half the proceeds from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's <IPO-BABA.N> mega-IPO this fall.

Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <1YMc1> rose 65 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> added 26.5 points. * Producer prices rose 0.4 percent in June against expectations calling for a 0.2 percent increase, with gains across most categories, indicating some inflation at the factory gate.
