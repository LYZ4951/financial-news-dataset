SOFIA, July 16 (Reuters) - Bulgaria is considering how to support bondholders of Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, Finance Minister Petar Chobanov told reporters on Wednesday.

Chobanov had told Reuters earlier in July that the holders of a dollar bond issued by Corpbank would be protected and not required to contribute to a rescue of the troubled lender, which was hit by a run on deposits in June.  But Chobanov's government has struggled to reach a consensus with Bulgaria's main political parties on the terms of the rescue of Corpbank, which requires a special law to be passed in parliament.
