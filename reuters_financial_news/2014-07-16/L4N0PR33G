July 16 (Reuters) - All Southeast Asian stock markets gained on Wednesday, helped by better-than-expected economic growth in China, while Indonesian shares rose to a more than 13-month closing high on hopes Joko "Jokowi" Widodo would win the presidential election.

The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> ended 0.9 percent firmer at 5,113.93, its highest close since May 30, 2013. Indonesian shares saw foreign inflows of $31.78 million on Wednesday. Analysts said news on the vote count was boosting sentiment as it continued to point toward Jokowi winning the election. Gains were led by a 2.2 percent rise in Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK>. Optimism around a possible win for Jakarta Governor Jokowi, who is perceived as being market friendly, had sent stocks to an over-13-month high the day after the election. On Tuesday, several members of Indonesia's second-largest political party said they were considering joining Jokowi's camp, which could lead to a friendlier parliament that would help push through a reform agenda.

Analysts expect further consolidation in Thai stocks.
