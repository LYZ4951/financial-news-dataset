PORT LOUIS, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The Mauritius finance ministry said excess liquidity in the Indian Ocean island's banking system had reached levels where it would have to step in to help the central bank mop it up by front-loading government borrowing.

Increasing the key repo rate <MUCBIR=ECI> would only serve to further increase liquidity, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development said in a statement late on Friday. "The Ministry of Finance is indeed concerned that the problem of excess liquidity in the banking system has deteriorated to the extent that it renders less effective the monetary transmission mechanism," it said.  On Monday, the Bank of Mauritius' monetary policy committee held the repo rate at 4.65 percent, but its members were divided on the decision, with some saying a rise in the rate could undermine economic recovery.

Bheenick also said excess liquidity was an urgent problem. The finance ministry said further options should be explored to mop up the excess liquidity. "The Ministry will assist ... by working out an optimal solution that will include assisting the Bank of Mauritius to mop up, without however giving any blank cheque; front-loading of Government Borrowing Requirements, and use of other appropriate instruments," it said.
