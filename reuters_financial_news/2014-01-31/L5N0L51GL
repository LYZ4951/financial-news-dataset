JOHANNESBURG, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Botswana's Letshego Holdings <LETS.BT> expects to deliver another double-digit percentage rise in loans for the fiscal year just ending, as it taps a booming market for unsecured loans to low income African individuals and small businesses.

However, managing director Chris Low told Reuters that pretax profit for the year ending January 2014 would probably be flat, as the so-called "micro finance" lender beds down acquisitions and faces a pick up in competition. "It's a combination of a pressure on margins and a number of strategic investments in technology and our expansion plan," he said in an interview on Friday.  Africa has experienced an explosion of unsecured lenders in the last decade trying to fill a niche among low income workers and small businesses that had largely been ignored by commercial banks for lack of collateral or credit history. The lenders typically charge high interest rates for the risk of writing the unsecured loans, and some have come unstuck as fast-growing economies have slowed.  In South Africa, for example, unsecured lender African Bank <ABLJ.J> has gotten into trouble after writing too much credit that morphed into mountains of bad debt. [ID:nL5N0IW082] Low, who declined to say what interest rates Letshego charges on its loans, pointed to the steps the firm takes to reduce risk. For example, it has salary deduction codes - agreements to collect repayments directly from the employer - in all of its main markets. Letshego, Botswana's biggest listed company by market value, posted a 10 percent rise in loans to 3.3 billion pula ($360 million) in the year ended Jan. 31, 2013. Pretax profit rose 18 percent to 841 million pula that financial year.  The firm, which lends small loans of up to 200,000 pula to individuals, is now arranging local currency credit lines across its 10 African operations to bolster its lending power. Low said it would begin a roadshow next week to raise a second tranche of a medium-term note facility at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).  The first tranche was for 700 million rand ($62.8 million) from a programme worth 2.5 billion rand, according to the JSE. Low declined to say how much the company wanted to raise. Letshego also has another 350 million pula note on the Botswana bourse.  The firm, with a market value of 5.2 billion pula, is taking a pause from an aggressive expansion strategy that saw it enter Lesotho in 2013 and purchase Micro Africa, which gave it exposure in Kenya, Rwanda and South Sudan. Its strategy is now to grow its business providing salary advances to government workers and to diversify into taking deposits, Low said.  In two weeks, Letshego will start receiving deposits in Mozambique - its first market in this regard.  The company closed its operations in Zambia in December and stopped lending in South Sudan when violence erupted in the new eastern African country in the same month. "We are only interested in operating in countries where we can operate with strong governance and clear ethics. We had a few issues that we were not prepared to deal with so preferred not to do business there," Low said of Zambia.
