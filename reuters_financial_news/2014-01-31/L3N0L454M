Jan 30 (Reuters) - The New Home Co LLC <NWHM.N> raised about $86 million in an initial public offering on Friday after its shares were priced at $11, an underwriter told Reuters.

The homebuilder priced its IPO of 7.8 million shares significantly below its expected price range of $15-$17 per share. Based on the number of shares outstanding, New Home would be valued at about $180.92 million. This marks the first IPO by a homebuilder in 2014. The New Home designs, constructs and sells homes in metropolitan areas in California, including coastal Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area and Sacramento. The proceeds would be used for land acquisition, development of lots, home construction and investment purposes, the company said in the filing with the U.S. regulators. The New Home counts TNHC Partners LLC and IHP Capital Partners among its stakeholders.
