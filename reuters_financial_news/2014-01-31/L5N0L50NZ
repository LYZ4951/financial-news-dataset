LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A bit like Alice in Wonderland, Turkey is becoming "curiouser and curiouser".

After holding off on interest rate hikes long after many market players thought they should move, they did move -  in a big way. It hasn't worked quite as well as might have been hoped, so Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has spoken about a Plan B or C. The central bank has ruled out the obvious - capital controls - so what does he mean? One result is that it is likely to have investors on edge, a position they do not generally favour. This does not bode well for the lira, which, if not alone, is still at the epicentre of the emerging market sell-off. Central banks from Russia to India have been promising, Draghi-like, to do what it takes to protect their currencies. But contagion is in the air. Look no further to see it than yesterday's shortened Hungarian T-bill auction. It is perhaps appropriate, then, that Budapest is hosting a large number of central bankers today at a conference. European Central Bank policymakers Ilmars Rimsevics (Latvia), Ewald Nowotny (Austria) and Christian Noyer (France) are all due to speak along with their Hungarian counterpart Gyorgy Matolcsy. Turkish Deputy Central Bank Governor Turalay Kenc was scheduled to attend, but has bowed out for some reason. The other thing on the ECBers' mind will be the euro zone's meagre inflation, something that won't be helped by tumbling currencies in some of its trading partners. Euro zone flash inflation for January is due and will be closely watched for its impact on ECB monetary policy at next week's rate setting meeting. Reuters polls suggest it will tick up slightly to 0.9 year-on-year, which would not unduly upset policymakers' expectations. But Germany's monthly and year-on-year inflation for December was slightly lower than expected yesterday. Any sign of further disinflation - or deflation - would raise pressure for another rate cut or some unconventional move. We will also get a steer on the early 2014 investment mood from our monthly global asset allocation polls. Japan's has already indicated a pull away from stocks to bonds. And in today's fat chance department, French President Francois Hollande visits London, where:
