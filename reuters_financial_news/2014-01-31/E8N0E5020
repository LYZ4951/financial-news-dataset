MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Popular <POP.MC> on Friday reported a 2013 net profit of 325 million euros ($441 million), beating analysts forecasts as it recovered from steep losses in 2012.

Like Spanish peers, Popular was helped in 2013 by lower provisions against soured property loans. These pushed it to post a 2.46 billion euro loss the previous year. Analysts had expected Popular to post a 2013 net profit of 261 million euros, according to a Reuters poll.
