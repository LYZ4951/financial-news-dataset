TBILISI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Georgia's second largest commercial bank and a unit of the biggest bank in the country plan initial public offerings (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, the central bank governor said.

"We are expecting to hear very soon about the second largest bank's IPO... on the London Stock Exchange," Georgy Kadagidze told Reuters in an interview. The second largest bank in Georgia is TBC Bank, whose stakeholders include JP Morgan and Ashmore Asset Management. "We also expect another IPO, by one of the entities of Bank of Georgia <BGEOq.L>. It will also be in London," he said. TBC's rival Bank of Georgia listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006 for $160 million. Kadagidze said one more major financial event in 2014 would be the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's (EBRD) intention to issue the first-ever lari-denominated bonds.
