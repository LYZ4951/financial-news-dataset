AMSTERDAM, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cable group Altice <ATC_w.AS> Chairman Patrick Drahi said on Friday the company was looking at lots of acquisitions in many countries but declined to comment on a potential merger with Vivendi's <VIV.PA> SFR.

Cable entrepreneur Drahi discussed such a deal with Vivendi last year but talks foundered over price.
