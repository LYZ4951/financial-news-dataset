LAGOS, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nigerian interbank lending rates closed unchanged on the week at an average of 10.3 percent on Friday, but dealers said they expected them to inch up sharply next week ahead of a planned debit of around 750 billion naira ($4.62 billion) to meet a new cash reserves requirement (CRR) by the central bank.

Lending rates among banks have remained unchanged for the third consecutive week. Traders said that was because of a large pool of idle funds in the system from matured Open Market Operations (OMO) debt, interest paid on bonds and cash posting for parliament members' allowances. The rate for depositing with the central bank is 200 basis points minus the base rate of 12 percent, so interbank rates never go lower than 10 percent.  Nigeria's central bank last week raised CRR on public sector deposits to 75 percent, from 50 percent, in a bid to further support the ailing naira currency. The regulator is due to debit banks' account for the CRR Thursday next week. Banks' cash balance with the central bank stood at 1.08 trillion naira at the opening of the market on Friday, more than the 986 billion last Friday.
