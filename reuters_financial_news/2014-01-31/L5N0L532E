TIRANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Albania's government cut its forecast for the Balkan nation's gross domestic product to 0.7 percent for 2013 from 1.7-1.9 percent, reflecting the sharpest quarterly contraction since 2009 when it felt the shocks of euro zone crisis.

The economy shrank 2.3 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2013, as output fell in all sectors bar agriculture during a lengthy change of government after a June election. The Socialist Party of Prime Minister Edi Rama won a parliamentary election in late June, but procedural rules meant they only took power in September.  Central bank governor Ardian Fullani blamed the contraction on the shock resulting from the full withdrawal of a fiscal stimulus programme and uncertainty before and after general elections in June, which hit consumption and tourism. Albania's economy grew strongly at around 6 percent per year from 2000, albeit from a low base. But the onset of the global economic downturn in 2008 and particularly the acute crises in neighbouring Greece and Italy have caused growth to shrink further each year.
