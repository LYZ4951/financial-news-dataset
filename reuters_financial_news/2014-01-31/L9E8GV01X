LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Friday it planned to make up to 100 jobs redundant as a result of an efficiency review, targeting its central services division.

Eighty to 100 jobs will be made redundant subject to staff consultation, the Bank said in a statement. The Bank employs just over 3,600 staff, of which 1,000 work in central services.
