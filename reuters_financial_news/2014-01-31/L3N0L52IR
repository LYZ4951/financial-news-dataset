BANGKOK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Thailand's top lender, Bangkok Bank Pcl <BBL.BK> is aiming for 2014 loan growth of 5-6 percent on the assumption that the country's economy will grow at 3 percent, executive chairman Kosit Panpiemras said on Friday.

The economic growth is likely to be lower than 3 percent this year if exports fall below the 7-8 percent target, Kosit told a seminar.  The bank had loan growth of 9.2 percent in 2013. In December, the top lender said it expected loan growth of 5-7 percent this year, based on the economic growth forecast of 4-5 percent.
