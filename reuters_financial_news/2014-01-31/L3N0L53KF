BANGKOK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Thai stocks rose on Friday as month-end buying lifted large caps such as PTT Pcl <PTT.BK> and Siam Cement Pcl <SCC.BK>, but trading volumes dropped due to holidays in the region and caution ahead of the Sunday election.

The SET index <.SETI> finished up 0.8 percent, its first gain in five sessions, led by index heavyweights such as PTT. Shares in Siam Cement rose 1 percent after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. [ID:nL3N0L42D8] In its latest strategy report, UBS Securities (Thailand)recommended investors to accumulate stocks on any weakness post elections. The benchmark fell for a third month in January, down 1.9 percent and taking its loss since November to around 12 percent, the region's worst performer, hit by the prolonged domestic political turmoil. Trading volumes on Friday almost halved the full-day average over the past 30 sessions, with players wary of the political risks and analysts said the Feb. 2 poll may not solve the current deadlock.
