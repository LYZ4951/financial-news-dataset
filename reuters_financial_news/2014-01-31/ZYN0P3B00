FRANKFURT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rate eased for the third day running on Friday after a European Central Bank board member said euro zone policymakers should not take economic recovery for granted.

Benoit Coeure, an ECB Executive Board member, said the euro zone recovery is weak and uneven. The ECB holds a policy meeting next Thursday, though a Reuters poll of economists pointed to rates staying on hold until mid-2015.[ID:nL5N0L32MW] Recent spikes in overnight lending rates had put pressure on the ECB to step in and curb the rise, which if it happens too quickly could even derail the recovery. But the amount of money sloshing around the euro zone's money markets is expected to remain at a high enough level into next week to keep short-term interest rates at current levels.
