JOHANNESBURG, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Nigerian borrowing costs are expected to rise next week due to a combination of the central bank's liquidity tightening measures and offshore investors selling local debt. In Kenya, Treasury bill yields are set to climb in line with higher overnight bank lending rates.

NIGERIA Yields on Nigerian local debt are expected to inch higher next week as an increase in the cash reserve requirement (CRR) on public sector deposits held by banks comes into effect on Feb. 4. Nigeria's central bank announced last week that it would lift the CRR to 75 percent from 50 percent to stabilise the naira, while leaving its benchmark interest rate at 12 percent for the 14th time in a row. Yields on three benchmark bonds included in JP Morgan's emerging market government bond index have risen by more than 30 basis points in the past week on growing risk aversion by offshore investors after the U.S Federal Reserve pushed ahead with scaling back its bond-buying stimulus. "We believed the market is oversold already and we are within the range for buying, especially for the local funds, but the scheduled debiting for CRR next week could trigger another round of sell-off," one dealer said. The yield on the 5-year bond <NG5YT=RR> was at 13.52 percent on Friday, compared with 13.17 percent a week ago, while the 7-year paper <NG7YT=RR> was 32 basis points higher at 13.61 percent, and the 10-year <NG10YT=RR> bond was trading at a yield of 13.57 percent, up 34 basis points.   KENYA Yields on Kenyan Treasury bills are expected to rise at next week's auction as tight liquidity and higher inflation push up overnight bank lending rates. Kenya's central bank will auction 91-day <KE3MT=RR>, 182-day <KE6MT=RR> and 364-day <KE1YT=RR> Treasury bills worth a total 9 billion shillings ($104.29 million) next week. At this week's sale, the weighted average yield on the 91-day paper rose slightly to 9.19 percent from 9.17 percent last week, as did that on the 182-day Treasury bill, which inched higher to 10.36 percent from 10.34 percent. The yield on the 364-day Treasury bill was steady at 10.69 percent. All the sales were undersubscribed. "We will continue to see undersubscription on T-bills as O/N (overnight rates) continue to tick higher in the coming week," Beutah Maroko, head of fixed income and money markets at Equity Bank, said. "Investors will hold out in bidding as they anticipate a rise on the rates bearing in mind of a slight rise in inflation in the month of January." Fixed income traders said tight money market liquidity had pushed up interbank lending rates. The weighted average interbank lending rate rose to 11.7218 percent on Thursday from 9.4895 percent a week earlier. Kenya's year-on-year inflation rate rose slightly in January to 7.21 percent from 7.15 percent in December, edging closer to the 7.5 percent upper threshold of the central bank's target range.

I think investors are going to require a higher rate of return for the time being," Fred Moturi, a fixed income analyst at Sterling Investment Bank, said.
