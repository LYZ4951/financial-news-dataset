SANTIAGO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service put the ratings of CorpBanca <COB.SN>  on review for upgrade, following Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco's <ITUB4.SA> deal to acquire control of the Chilean bank.

The ratings agency, which had downgraded CorpBanca in December to Baa3 from Baa2, said on Friday that the proposed merger could have a beneficial effect on CorpBanca's funding flexibility, margins, and capital, and also strengthen its market presence. CorpBanca and Itau announced the deal, valued at an estimated $3.7 billion, on Tuesday. Itau is seeking a bigger footprint in Chile and Colombia, while CorpBanca, Chile's fifth-largest bank, is looking to scale up. [ID:nL2N0L30LL] In December Moody's had cited fears about the read-across impact on CorpBanca of problems at linked retail business SMU, both of which are controlled by Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh via his CorpGroup empire. [ID:nL2N0JL1RD] The unlisted SMU has been scrambling to get its affairs in order since last July, when it revealed accounting errors that pushed CorpBanca shares to an all-time low. In November Saieh injected $300 million into SMU, which runs supermarket group Unimarc.
