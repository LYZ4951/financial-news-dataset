SYDNEY, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Australian shares closed flat on Friday after weak metals prices undercut an uptick in private sector credit, and posted their first January loss in four years in a patchy start to the year. [ID:nL3N0L45ZI]

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> ended the day 2 points higher at 5,190.0 and fell 1 percent for the week, its fourth consecutive week of losses.  Australia's share market shed 3 percent in January as investors sold out of equities on slowing growth in China and as the U.S. Federal Reserve continued to taper its bond-buying programme.
