STOCKHOLM, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy has developed basically as expected by the Riksbank since it cut rates in December, First Deputy Governor Kerstin af Jochnick said on Friday.

"My view is that the information that has come in, and the development as it looks today, is in line with what we expected in December," af Jochnick told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. In December, the Riksbank cut its key repo rate to 0.75 percent over worries about low inflation, setting aside concerns among the majority of rate-setters about household debt levels that are among the highest in Europe.
