TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group Inc <8411.T> posted a 35.7 percent decline in October-December net profit as stock-related income fell from the end of 2012 when shares prices shot up ahead of the election of a pro-growth government.

The Japanese lender, like bigger rival Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc <8306.T>, has enjoyed a bumper year in its stock portfolio since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe campaigned for office promising to end a decade of deflation. [ID:nL6N0K90QN] Gains made from trading shares and from the rising value of stocks held soared in subsequent quarters compared with the year prior. But the on-year comparison lost its shine in the latest quarter which is pitted against the end-2012 rally. A dip in stock-related income brought net profit down in October-December to 133.4 billion yen ($1.3 billion) from 207.5 billion yen a year earlier, Reuters calculations show based on nine-month figures. In April-December, profit rose 43.7 percent to 563.1 billion yen. The bank kept its full-year forecast at 600 billion yen, or 7 percent higher than the year prior, compared with the 638.3 billion yen mean estimate of 18 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
