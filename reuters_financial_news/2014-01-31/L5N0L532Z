ISTANBUL, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira on Friday eased to levels seen before a massive rate hike earlier this week as households and firms bought dollars amid a sell-off in emerging markets.

The central bank raised interest rates by around 500 basis points at an emergency meeting on Tuesday despite government's  opposition, stunning markets and causing a spike in the battered currency. [ID:nL5N0L51KA] Turkey's lira <TRYTOM=D3> was trading at 2.2725 against the dollar by 1540 GMT, although still off a record low of 2.39 reached on Monday.  The lira fell 17 percent in 2013 and extended its slide this year as a graft scandal hit the government, heightening investor concern about political stability just as a gradual end to U.S. monetary stimulus knocked appetite for emerging market assets. Turkish households and firms are hoarding dollars, suggesting they have little faith the lira will be spared a further sell-off despite the bold move on rates. [ID:nL5N0L51KA] The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond <tTR270923TA=IS> fell to 10.34 percent from 10.39 percent a day earlier.
