Jan 31 (Reuters) - Detroit has circulated a plan for its finances that would require concessions from pension funds, seek reduced payments to some bondholders, and declare that a major interest-rate obligation is a disputed claim that is not part of the settlement, according to a city report reviewed by Reuters.

Following is the creditor class structure proposed in the city's plan, indicated whether the class is impaired and its status in terms of whether or not it will be asked to vote to accept or reject the plan of adjustment: Class   NameImpairment   Voting  Secured Claims  1A  All Classes of  Impaired Voting  DWSD Class A   Water Claims   1B  All Classes of  Impaired Voting  DWSD Class B   Water Claims   1C  All Classes of  Impaired Voting  DWSD Class A   Sewer Claims   1D  All Classes of  Impaired Voting  DWSD Class B   Sewer Claims   1E  All Classes of  Impaired Voting  DWSD Revolving Sewer BondsClaims 1F  All Classes of  Impaired Voting  DWSD Revolving Water BondsClaims 2A  Secured GO  Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Series 2010Claims 2B  Secured GO  Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Series 2010(A) Claims 2C  Secured GO  Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Series 2012(A)(2) Claims 2D  Secured GO  Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Series 2012(A2-B) Claims 2E  Secured GO  Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Series 2012(B) Claims 2F  Secured GO  Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Series 2012(B2)   Claims 3   Other Secured   Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Claims 4   HUD Unimpaired   Nonvoting  InstallmentNotes Claims   5   COP SwapImpaired Voting  Claims 6   Parking BondUnimpaired   Nonvoting  ClaimsUnsecured claims  7   Limited Tax Impaired Voting  GeneralObligation Bond Claims8   Unlimited Tax   Impaired Voting  GeneralObligation Bond Claims9   COP Claims  Impaired Voting  10  PFRS Claims Impaired Voting  11  Small PFRS  Impaired Voting  Claims 12  GRS Claims  Impaired Voting  13  Small GRS   Impaired Voting  Claims 14  DowntownImpaired Voting  DevelopmentAuthority  Claims 15  Other   Impaired Voting  Unsecured  Claims 16  Convenience Unimpaired   Nonvoting  Claims 17  SubordinatedImpaired Nonvoting  Claims Key: DWSD = Detroit Water and Sewer Department GO = General Obligation HUD = Housing and Urban Development COP = Certificates of Participation PFRS = Police and Fire Retirement System GRS = General Retirement System
