MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The chairman of Banco Popular <POP.MC> said on Friday the lender would consider buying state-owned bank Catalunya Caixa if it was put up for sale.

"We would study it, we would look at any operation that comes up so long as it doesn't put the bank's solvency at risk," said Chairman Angel Ron at a press conference.
