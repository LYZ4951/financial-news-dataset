MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Spain's biggest nationalised lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>, is expected to have returned to profit in 2013 after it reported a massive loss of 19 billion euros a year earlier.

The average forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts was for annual profit of 530 million euros. However, experts also pointed out that other Spanish banks have reported lower-than-expected profits due to increased provisions for bad loans in the last months of the year, and that Bankia could see the same effect. The government bailed out Bankia in 2012 and the lender got a capital injection of 18 billion euros out of a 41.3-billion-euro European rescue fund for Spain's wobbly banks. In the fourth quarter, analysts expect Bankia to report net interest income - the earning from loans minus funding costs - of 674 million euros, up from 643 million euros in the July-September period, reflecting lower financing costs. Bankia, which was one of the country's banks most exposed to soured real estate assets, has cut costs and branches and sold off assets, and the government is expected to soon begin the process of selling off part of its 68 percent in the bank.
