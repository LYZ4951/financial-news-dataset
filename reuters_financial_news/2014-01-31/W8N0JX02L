WARSAW, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Poland's state bank BGK will offer traders special arrangements to buy and sell back government bonds from Feb. 17 to help the market in case of disruption, the finance ministry said in a statement.

As part of a controversial pension reform, bonds are due to be transferred from the portfolios of privately-managed pension funds to the state next Monday.  Local traders are worried that the transfer will reduce liquidity and could make trading volatile, particularly given the global emerging market rout.
