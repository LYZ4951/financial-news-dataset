MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest bank BBVA <BBVA.MC> said it would probably make an offer for Catalunya Caixa when it came up for auction, the third Spanish bank to express interest in the state-owned lender on Friday.

"We'll look at it very carefully and closely, we will probably make an offer," Chairman Francisco Gonzalez told journalists at a press conference.
