OSLO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank will not sell Norwegian crowns in February to buy foreign exchange for the country's sovereign wealth fund, the bank said on Friday on its <NOCC> page, continuing its January practice.

Last month the central bank said it would refrain from buying foreign exchange so the fund could invest money in foreign stocks and bonds. The fund invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations. It is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.
