SYDNEY, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has affirmed their long and short-term sovereign credit ratings on the Slovak Republic at 'A/A-1' with a stable outlook.

The credit ratings agency said the rating reflects expectations that the government will stabilize its debt burden through fiscal consolidation, a stable banking sector and that external indebtedness will remain low.
