MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Spain's third-biggest bank Caixabank <CABK.MC> on Friday posted a net profit of 503 million euros ($682 million) for 2013, more than double 2012 earnings as charges on soured property deals fell.

The bank missed analyst forecasts as it was predicted to post a 543 million euro profit for the period, according to a Reuters poll.  Barcelona-based Caixabank said net interest income, or earnings from loans minus funding costs, rose 2.1 percent to 3.9 billion euros, in line with forecasts.
