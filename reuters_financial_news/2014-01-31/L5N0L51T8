MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Spain will next week formally seek advisors to steer the sale of part of its 68 percent stake in bailed out lender Bankia <BKIA.MC>, a spokeswoman for the country's bank restructuring fund FROB said on Friday.

Government and banking sources had told Reuters earlier this month the Spanish government was considering selling a stake of as much as 18 percent during the first quarter of this year, aiming to start recouping part of the 22 billion euros ($29.8 billion) injected into the bank since 2012. [ID:nL6N0KO1FU] Bankia became a symbol of Spain's financial crisis, after the huge losses it and other banks suffered due to a property market collapse forced the government to take 41.3 billion euros in European aid to rescue the country's weakest lenders. A source with knowledge of planning at the economy ministry and the FROB said the state would likely follow in the footsteps of UK Financial Investments, which first sold a 6 percent stake in Lloyds <LLOY.L> in September and is now looking at selling more, possibly including a sale to retail investors.
