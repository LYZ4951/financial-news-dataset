NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Friday approved most of Bank of America Corp's <BAC.N> $8.5 billion settlement with investors in mortgage securities, which would resolve much of the bank's liability from its acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp during the financial crisis.

Justice Barbara Kapnick ruled that Bank of New York Mellon <BK.N>, the trustee overseeing the securities, had acted reasonably in determining that the settlement was in the best interests of the investors. Kapnick made one exception to her ruling, saying the trustee had not acted reasonably in settling certain loan modification claims brought by the investors.
