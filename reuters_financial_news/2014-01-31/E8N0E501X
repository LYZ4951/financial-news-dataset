MADRID, Jan 31 (Reuters) - BBVA <BBVA.MC>, Spain's second-biggest bank, posted a smaller than expected fourth quarter loss of 849 million euros ($1 billion) on Friday, after it took charges from the sale of a 5 percent stake in China's CITIC Bank Corp <601998.SS>.

Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the bank would make a 1.1 billion euro loss in the period. Profits for the whole of 2013 rose by a third, helped by lower provisions against soured Spanish property loans.
