Jan 31 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ukraine's government bond rating to Caa2 from Caa1 with a negative outlook, citing continued risk of an external liquidity crisis due to the prolonged political uncertainty in the country.

"(The) decision to assign a negative outlook on Ukraine's Caa2 rating was mainly driven by the continued risk of an external liquidity crisis, even if Russia's support package were to be disbursed as planned," Moody's said in a statement.
