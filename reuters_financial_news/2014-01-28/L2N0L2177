MEXICO CITY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street's industry-funded watchdog FINRA on Tuesday fined Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Banorte $475,000 for inadequate money-laundering controls and for failing to register certain foreign workers who were bringing foreign money to the U.S. unit.

A U.S. unit of Banorte <GFNORTEO.MX>, Mexico's No. 4 bank by assets, opened an account for a customer with reported ties to a drug cartel and did not "detect, investigate or report the suspicious rapid movement of $28 million in and out of the account," the FINRA statement said. FINRA said it suspended Brian Anthony Simmons, the former anti-money laundering and chief compliance officer of the bank's U.S. unit, Banorte-Ixe Securities International. The fine also reflected the bank's failure to register about 200 to 400 so-called "foreign finders" who get paid for bringing non-U.S. business to the bank. In a separate statement, Banorte said it recognizes that any inadequacy is unacceptable. The bank "has improved its systems to correct the points outlined by the regulator," it said.
