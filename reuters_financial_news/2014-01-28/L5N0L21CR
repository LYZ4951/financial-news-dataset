Jan 28 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates central bank's foreign currency assets fell to 269.0 billion dirhams ($73.2 billion) in October from 284.3 billion in the previous month, which was their highest level since 2007, official data showed on Tuesday.

The fall, which was the largest since at least 2009, was due to a drop in deposits to a 10-month low of 79.3 billion dirhams, despite a rise of foreign securities holdings to a record high of 149.0 billion, central bank data showed.
