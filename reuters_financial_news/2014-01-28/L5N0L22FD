LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The second largest shareholder in British fund firm F&C Asset Management <FCAM.L>, which has agreed a takeover offer from Bank of Montreal <BMO.L>, has said it may support a rival bid if one emerges.

In a statement on Tuesday after Bank of Montreal and F&C announced a deal valuing the fund manager at around 708 million pounds ($1.2 billion), Standard Life Investments said the price "represents an attractive valuation from the standpoint of the Canadian bank." "We intend to keep our options open should another suitor for F&C emerge," said David Cumming, Global Head of Equities at Standard Life Investments, which holds more than 10.2 percent of F&C.
