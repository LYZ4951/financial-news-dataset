LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - European shares rebounded from one-month lows in early trading on Tuesday, with Siemens <SIEGn.DE> gaining after posting a 15 percent jump in core operating profit.

Shares in the German conglomerate rose more than 2 percent following impressive results as new Chief Executive Joe Kaeser reined in costs and tightened control of major projects. [ID:nL5N0L209I] Siemens helped the European industrial goods and services sector <.SXNP> to gain more than 1 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.5 percent at 1,296.80 points at 0813 GMT, after falling to a one-month low in the previous session. However, gains were likely to be under check on brewing concerns that a cut in U.S. stimulus could hurt emerging economies.
