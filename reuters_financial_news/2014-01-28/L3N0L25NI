WELLINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The New Zealand government's annual budget will be released on May 15, Finance Minister Bill English said on Wednesday.

English said the government's policies would focus on supporting a more competitive and faster-growing economy. "The government remains on track to surplus next year and we will then have choices that we simply don't have while we are running deficits," English said in a statement. The economy is forecast to grow at least 3 percent in each of the next two years, improving the government's finances and leading to a budget surplus of NZ$86 million ($71.04 million) in the 2014-15 fiscal year, its first since 2007-08. Earlier this week, English said the government would not relax its tight controls on spending, despite this being an election year, and reaffirmed a NZ$1 billion limit on new spending in this year's budget. The return to surplus will also coincide with the peak of the government's net debt burden after which it is forecast to reduce borrowing and start repaying debt. The government's tight fiscal policies have been a constraint on the economy and a factor in the central bank holding rates at a record low for nearly three years.
