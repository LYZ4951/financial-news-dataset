STOCKHOLM, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Swedish banking group Swedbank SWEDa.ST said on Tuesday it was raising its dividend for the year as it posted a fourth-quarter net profit that undershot forecasts as a write-down in its portfolio of repossessed real estate weighed.

Net profit for continuing operations fell 13 percent to 3.67 billion Swedish crowns ($570.7 million), undershooting a mean forecast for 3.96 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts. The bank said the impairment of tangible assets had amounted to 311 million crowns in the quarter.
