ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank governor Erdem Basci said he saw the real effective exchange rate of the lira at slightly above 100 in January, referring to a rate the bank monitors to avoid excessive currency volatility.

The real effective exchange rate fell to 106.85 in December from a revised 109.38 in November. It measures the weighted average of domestic prices relative to those of Turkey's trading partners.
