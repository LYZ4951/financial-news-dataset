ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkish Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said on Tuesday he expected to start using the interest rate tool in monetary policy.

"We know that tightening moves to halt excessive volatility are way more effective when they are backed by interest rates," he said. "A steep decline in forex reserves may cause other concerns, thus the interest rate instrument should be implemented in this environment."
