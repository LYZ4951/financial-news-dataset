SAO PAULO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Cielo SA <CIEL3.SA>, Brazil's largest card payment processor, likely saw profit growth slowing in the fourth quarter as rising expenses and declining market share offset the impact of a jump in transaction volumes, a Thomson Reuters poll of five analysts showed on Tuesday.

Net income at the Barueri, Brazil-based company probably rose 6.7 percent to 737 million reais ($306 million) in the quarter, the analysts said. Profit had risen 11 percent in the third quarter on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The merchant acquirer will release fourth-quarter results late on Tuesday. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, profit rose 20.5 percent on an annual basis.  While "Cielo's figures once again should be strongly influenced by robust top line performance, robust revenue generation should be partially offset by higher operating expenses," Victor Schabbel, an analyst with Credit Suisse Securities, said in a client note. Shares of Cielo rose 1.6 percent on Tuesday to 64.01 reais. The stock is up 44 percent over the past 12 months. Net revenue is expected to have risen 8.1 percent to 1.88 billion reais, with higher transaction volumes for debit card payments propelling revenue gains, the poll found. A 6 percent drop in Brazil's currency boosted results at Cielo's United States-based unit. Marketing and administrative expenses jumped because of seasonal reasons, said Carlos Macedo, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group. In the quarter, Cielo began booking fee revenue from interest-rate-free installments at the moment of the purchase, an accounting change that may make earnings more volatile going forward. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profitability known as EBITDA, rose 2.6 percent to 954 million reais. According to the poll, EBITDA probably fell to 51.8 percent of net revenue in the quarter, from 53.5 percent in the previous three months. Management and investors will discuss results on a Wednesday conference call focusing on competition, pricing and volume trends, and the impact of the soccer World Cup in June on revenue.  Cielo lost customers to Itaú Unibanco Holding SA's <ITUB4.SA> Rede unit in the quarter, the poll found. Rede, Brazil's No. 2 acquirer, aims to grab some of Cielo's clients in the small- and mid-sized corporate segment. A price war is unlikely, analysts said.
