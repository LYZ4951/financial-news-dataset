Jan 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has taken rating actions on Castoro  RMBS, a repackaging of Grecale ABS notes, issued by Italy-based Unipol Banca  S.p.A. [UNPIBN.UL] as follows:  Castoro RMBS S.r.l. [CATRO.UL] Class A (ISIN XS0218205473) affirmed at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Negative; Class B (ISIN XS0218206364) upgraded to 'A+sf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS Sufficient Credit Enhancement Since transaction close in 2005, the portfolio has amortised at an average  payment rate of 16%, leading to an outstanding balance of 22.1% as of  end-December 2013. Furthermore, the hedging agreement in place generates healthy  gross excess spread, sufficient to provision for defaulted (defined as mortgages  with seven unpaid monthly installments) and delinquent (defined as mortgages in  arrears for more than 30 days) loans. Any net excess spread remaining after the  payment of senior fees, interest and provisions is trapped and used to  accelerate the redemption of the notes, thus building up a sizable  overcollateralisation (EUR24.3m; 17.2% of the current pool balance). This  mechanism has contributed to the build-up in credit enhancement available to the  rated notes. Given the high level of credit enhancement available, the class B  notes were upgraded to 'A+sf'.   Broadly Stable Asset Performance  As of end-December 2013, the volume of gross cumulative defaults was 5.1% of the  original pool balance, up from 4.7% at end-December 2012. At the same time, the  pipeline of late stage arrears (arrears in excess of three months) has declined  to 0.7% of the current pool, from 1.1% 12 months ago. Based on the contained  weighted average original loan-to-value ratio at closing (59.3%), Fitch expects  that the asset performance will remain fairly stable.  Robust Liquidity Facility Castoro RMBS has in place a fully funded liquidity facility, which has amortised  to its floor level (1.5% of the original balance). The facility is to cover any  interest shortfalls, and is deemed sufficient to mitigate the risk of a  potential default of the servicer even in a rising interest rate environment.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Continued deterioration of the Italian macroeconomic fundamentals or a  slower-than-expected economic recovery could lead to negative rating actions on  the sovereign, which could result in a revision of the highest achievable rating  for the 'AA+sf' rated tranches.
