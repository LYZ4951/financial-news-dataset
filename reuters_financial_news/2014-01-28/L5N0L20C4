WARSAW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank is likely to raise interest rates in the second half of this year if its March projections confirm that the economic revival is gathering strength, rate-setter Jerzy Hausner was quoted as saying on Tuesday.

"If I back with my name an optimistic scenario, then I must be consistent," Hausner said. "Hence my conviction that monetary tightening might begin as soon as the second half of the year."  The bank will release its new tri-annual round of economic forecasts at the beginning of March. Hausner said on Monday that he expected economic growth to exceed 3 percent in 2014, reaching 4 percent in the second half of the year. "If my scenario is reflected in the March (central bank) projection, then I am convinced that other policymakers will also start thinking about interest rate hikes" Hausner said.  The central bank has pledged to keep rates unchanged at their all-time low of 2.50 percent at least until the end of June.
