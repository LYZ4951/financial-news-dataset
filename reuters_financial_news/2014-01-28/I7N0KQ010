ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkish Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said on Tuesday the bank had signaled tightening at its last monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting as inflation in January may be higher than expected.

At that meeting on Jan. 21, the bank left its key rates unchanged but announced what effectively amounted to a rate increase by the back door, saying it would fund the interbank market at 9 percent on "additional tightening" days.
