JERUSALEM, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Israel Discount Bank <DSCT.TA> said on Tuesday it had decided not to accept any of the proposals submitted for the acquisition of its holdings in U.S. unit Discount Bankcorp.

Discount Bankcorp [DSCTN.UL] is the parent company of IDB New York. "The process of considering the sale of Discount Bank Latin America, a subsidiary of IDB New York, will continue," Discount said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Discount, Israel's third-biggest bank, had said it might sell all or part of its New York business to shore up its balance sheet. Net income at its New York subsidiary slipped to $42.7 million in 2012 from $45.8 million in 2011, while total assets rose to $10 billion from $9.5 billion.
