ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkish Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci said on Tuesday that currency volatility in the last week had prompted the decision to hold an extraordinary monetary policy committee meeting later on Tuesday.

The bank is due to make a statement after that meeting at midnight local time (2200 GMT).
