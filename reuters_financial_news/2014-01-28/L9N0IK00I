LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's dollar bonds rose on Tuesday and its debt insurance costs fell as the country's parliament voted in favour of repealing a set of anti-protest laws.

Ukraine's 2023 dollar bond <XS091760584=TE> rose 3 points to hit its highest level in almost a week. The 2020 bond <UA054378319=> rose 3.3 points. Ukraine's five-year credit default swaps fell 61 basis points from Monday's close to 871 bps, having hit a one-month high on Monday, according to Markit. The parliamentary vote is a concession to the opposition aimed at calming unrest on the streets. Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov offered his resignation to President Viktor Yanukovich. "The fact that Yanukovich seems willing to negotiate and reconsider the constitution and most importantly, to repeal the anti-protest laws, is a big thing. Clearly he is backtracking from the aggressive stance. As long as he is willing to find a compromise with the opposition, it is a positive," said Barbara Nestor, strategist at Commerzbank. The hryvnia remained under pressure however, trading at a four-year low of 8.5 to the dollar <UAH=> despite central bank dollar sales earlier.
