DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, the largest lender by market value in the United Arab Emirates, posted fourth-quarter profit that fell marginally from a year earlier, in line with analysts' estimates.

NBAD, majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi government, said on Tuesday that net profit for the quarter was 1.08 billion dirhams ($294 million), slightly lower than 1.12 billion dirhams in the year-ago quarter. Six analysts polled by Reuters had forecast quarterly net profit of 1.10 billion dirhams.
