WARSAW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Poland is not ready to adopt the euro and needs to cut its debt and know that the final form of the currency union is safe before it can join, Finance Minister Mateusz Szczurek was quoted as saying.

Szczurek also said, in his first detailed comments about the euro zone and banking union accession since his appointment in November, that it made no sense for Poland to "blindly" enter a banking union before knowing exactly what shape it will take. "It is absolutely essential that the final shape of the euro zone is safe for Poland," Szczurek was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP late on Monday.  "Poland must be ready to function in the euro zone, and the euro zone must solve the problems which it still faces," he said. Poland has been a member of the European Union since 2004 and is legally obliged to adopt the common currency at some point in the future.  For that to happen, the EU's largest eastern economy must change its constitution, which is likely to be difficult before and after the 2015 general election, as the majority of Poles currently oppose joining the euro. Szczurek said Poland must also be prepared for situations where interest rates in the euro zone would, for example, be proper for Germany but too high or low for Poland. "We must have mechanisms that would allow us to compensate for those differences," he said, adding that this mechanism would mostly consist of fiscal policy, which requires a lower public debt. "So in my opinion, before Poland enters the euro zone, it should have a lower public debt, should be able to react to changing economic conditions for example by compensating a recession and problems in the private sector with increased public spending." Szczurek also said that Poland currently has its own, well-functioning system of deposit guarantees and has the comfort of being able to make a well-informed decision on whether to enter the banking union. "While the banking union is not fully ready and functioning, we do not think that it makes sense to enter it blindly," Szczurek said. Banking union is Europe's most ambitious reform project since the launch of the euro as it is expected to create an agency and fund to shut problem banks, after the European Central Bank begins policing the region's lender next year.
