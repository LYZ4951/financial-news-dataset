SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Seoul shares ended higher on Tuesday, off a five-month closing low the previous day, buoyed by strength in the auto and telecoms sectors ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.3 percent at 1,916.93 points, recouping some of the 1.6 percent slide of the previous session. Despite the persistent sell-off by foreigners, who sold a net 314.7 billion Korean won ($290.4 million) worth of KOSPI shares on Tuesday, institutional and retail investors underpinned the index by net purchasing a combined 302.1 billion won. Automaker Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> rose 3.1 percent on the back of a stabilising won currency, while its affiliate Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd <012330.KS> added 3.6 percent following a strong October-December earnings report. [ID:nL3N0L21KS] Telecoms added support, with SK Telecom Co Ltd <017670.KS> and KT Corp <030200.KS> advancing 3.7 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.
