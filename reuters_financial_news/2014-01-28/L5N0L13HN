MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Santander <SAN.MC>, the euro zone's biggest bank, is expected to nearly double yearly profits and post a rise in fourth quarter income when it reports earnings on Thursday, helped by lower provisions against soured real estate loans.

The Spanish lender is forecast to post a 4.54 billion euro ($6.21 billion) net profit for 2013, according to the average estimate from nine analysts polled by Reuters. That compares to 2.295 billion euros in 2012, when, like domestic peers, it had to take steep provisions against losses on property assets. Fourth-quarter profits are also expected to leap, around three-fold, at Santander, which makes half its profit in Latin America and is heavily reliant on Brazil. Several analysts expected Santander to book the sale of half its asset management division in the period, which generated a net capital gain of 700 million euros. Lower provisions and falling costs are also expected to offset a year-on-year fall in fourth quarter net interest income (NII), which tracks the difference between earnings from loans and funding costs. Net interest income is seen falling 10.7 percent to 6.34 billion euros in the last three months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, according to eight analysts polled, as contributions from Latin America are likely to fall. But NII is forecast to rise about 1 percent compared to the third quarter of 2013, reflecting quarter on quarter improvements also posted by Spanish peers as deposit costs in the country fall.
