SYDNEY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set for a sluggish open on Wednesday, lingering near a six-week low touched in the previous session, with investors waiting to see more production and earnings guidance from local companies.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> added two points to 5,135.0, which is still a 40.1-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark fell 1.3 percent on Tuesday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> inched up 0.3 percent to 4,861.7 in early trade. * U.S. stocks bounced back on Tuesday after the S&P 500's three-day slide, helped by Pfizer's upbeat results and as investors turned their focus to the Federal Reserve's next move on stimulus. * Copper hit a seven-week low on Tuesday as buying interest faded ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in Asia and as a stronger dollar weighed, though a steadier tone in emerging markets helped limit the metal's losses. * U.S. oil rose nearly $2 on Tuesday, settling at its highest price this year and narrowing its discount to European Brent crude, as traders expected data to show supplies were draining from the contract's benchmark delivery point. * Gold miner Evolution Mining Ltd <EVN.AX> reiterates 2014 full-year production guidance of 400,000 to 450,000 ounces with cash operating costs in the range of A$770 to A$820 per ounce. [ID:nWNBS00ARW] * Iron ore miner Atlas Iron Ltd <AGO.AX> will report its December quarter production data.  ------------------ MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2203 GMT ------------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1,792.5  0.61%10.940 USD/JPY <JPY=>   102.95  0% 0.000 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.7681  -- 0.002 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1,256.29 0.01% 0.080 US CRUDE<CLc1>   97.221.57% 1.500 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   15,928.560.57% 90.68 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  141.52   0.69%  0.97 -------------------------------------------------------------  * Wall St rebounds with Pfizer and the Fed; Apple sinks[.N] * Oil rises nearly $2 to 2014 high on spread trade [O/R] * Gold falls for second day as equities rise; Fed eyed [GOL/] * Copper hits 7-wk low on firm dollar, Lunar New Year lull [MET/L]  DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
