PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France's fourth-biggest listed bank, Natixis <CNAT.PA>, is betting on insurance and asset management in a search for higher returns at a time of tougher post-crisis rules on risk-taking, its chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday.

The investment bank is in the early stages of a new restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs and growing after years of slimming down its balance sheet to adapt to tougher European capital requirements.
