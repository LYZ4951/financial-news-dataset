OSLO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Owners of offshore drilling rigs should expect day rates to decline, which would also lead to lower market valuations for their shares, investment bank Barclays said in a research note on Tuesday.

In its base case scenario for rig firms, Barclays estimated day rates for ultra deepwater units to drop to $475.000 from a current level of $525,000. For all rig types, the average rate would drop 16 percent from today's levels, it said. "We think this is the most likely outcome as we continue to believe the market still needs to work through excess capacity and that conditions will get worse before they get better," Barclays added. Under this scenario, all companies in the sector, except Rowan <RDC.N>, would see their shares fall, with the average drop estimated at 35 percent.  BULL AND BEAR SCENARIOS Under an optimistic scenario for the market, rates will stay at today's levels, with ultra deep water rates at $525,000 per day, Barclays said.  In the case of Seadrill <SDRL.OL>, the top firm in the sector, investors have been too optimistic in their assumptions even if current rates prevail, and there is an implied downside to the stock of 18 percent, it said.
