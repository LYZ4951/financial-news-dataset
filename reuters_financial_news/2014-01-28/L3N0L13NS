MUMBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India unexpectedly raised its policy interest rate on Tuesday by 25 basis points (bps) but said that if consumer price inflation eases as projected, it does not foresee further near-term tightening.

The RBI raised its policy repo rate <INREPO=ECI> by 25 bps  to 8.00 percent. Most economists in a Reuters poll conducted last week had expected no change in rates. <ID:nBAYSCEA2J]  COMMENTARY DARIUSZ KOWALCZYK, SENIOR ECONOMIST AND STRATEGIST, CREDIT AGRICOLE CIB, HONG KONG: "This (the rate hike) is very surprising given that inflation fell sharply of late. The central bank continues to confound markets after withholding from an expected hike at the previous meeting despite having talked tough about inflation. "The repeated wrong-footing of markets is likely to hit Indian assets today, and we expect declines of the INR, G-Sec bond prices and equities. Stocks and the currency will suffer also from the negative impact of the decision on growth."

The partially convertible rupee <INR=D2> trims gains to be at 63.10 per dollar, from 62.99 before the repo rate hike. The benchmark BSE share index <.BSESN> falls 0.6 percent the repo rate hike; had been up 0.2 percent before.  BACKGROUND - The wholesale price index (WPI) <INWPI=ECI>, India's main inflation indicator, climbed an annual 6.16 percent in December, its slowest pace since July 2013, compared with 7.52 percent in November, data showed this month. [ID:nL3N0KO25L] - Production at factories, mines and utilities <INIP=ECI> shrunk for the second straight month in November, by 2.1 percent, data showed earlier this month, dragged down by a contraction in consumer goods output. [ID:nL3N0KK3WS] - Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan last week called inflation a "destructive disease" that was forcing the bank to keep interest rates high. [ID:nL3N0KX4NT]
