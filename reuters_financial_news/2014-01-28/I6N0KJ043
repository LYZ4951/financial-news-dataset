MILAN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Shares in banks Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> and Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> were the leading losers on the Milan bourse on Tuesday morning with declines of more than 4 percent, amid continued concerns about their capital strength.

By 08354 GMT, Monte Paschi shares was suspended limit down after a decline of 4.1 percent, while Banco Popolare was also halted after a drop of 4.3 percent. Both banks need to beef up their capital ratios and plan to raise fresh funds through rights issues in the coming months. Earlier on Tuesday, Citigroup cut its target price on Monte Paschi, which is looking to raise 3 billion euros in fresh capital, to 0.15 euros from 0.19 euros with a sell rating.
