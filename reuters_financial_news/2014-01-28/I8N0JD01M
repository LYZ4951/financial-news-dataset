MUMBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India will have room to cut interest rates when inflation comes down but whether or not the RBI actually cuts the rate is a bit too premature to say, Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday after hiking rates in a surprise move.

Rajan also said that it was necessary to make the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) a liquidity function rather than a funding function, but added that he does not see the need to cut the SLR immediately.
