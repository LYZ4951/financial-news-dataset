LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The former deputy chairman of the Co-operative Bank <42TE.L> said he stepped down because he opposed its plans to buy hundreds of branches from Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L>.

Rodney Baker-Bates told parliament's Treasury Select Committee that he considered the proposed acquisition to be a "giant step too far". "I wished to resign because of my opposition to Verde (plan to buy 630 branches from Lloyds)," he said on Tuesday. Co-op, which is owned by its members and has operations spanning banking, supermarkets and funeral services, was last year rocked after a 1.5 billion pound ($2.5 billion) capital shortfall was identified at its bank and Paul Flowers, former chairman of the bank, was arrested as part of an investigation into the supply of illegal drugs.
