HONG KONG, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd <0016.HK> posted a 15 percent rise in full-year underlying profit on Friday, as strong end-user demand boosted sales after steep discounts attracted buyers who had been scared off by tightening measures.

Sun Hung Kai made an underlying profit of HK$21.4 billion for the 2014 fiscal year, up from HK$18.6 billion a year earlier, the company said in a statement issued after the market closed. Analysts had forecast an underlying profit of HK$21.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, based on the average of estimates from 17 banks and brokerages.   The company has achieved more than HK$21 billion for Hong Kong contracted sales for the 2014 fiscal year, 10 percent above its original annual target of HK$19 billion and more than the HK$18 billion sales recorded in 2013, according to BNP Paribas.
