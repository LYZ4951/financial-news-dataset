Sept 12 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

* The U.S. government was so determined to collect the Internet communications of foreign Yahoo customers in 2008 that it threatened the company with fines of $250,000 a day if it did not immediately comply with a secret court order to turn over the data. The threat, which was made public Thursday as part of about 1,500 pages of previously classified documents that were unsealed by a federal court, adds new details to the public history of a fight that unfolded in secret at the time.

(http://nyti.ms/1uyuqbo)  * Chinese regulators fined Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> and Fiat's <FIA.MI> Chrysler for violating antitrust laws, announcing on Thursday the first monetary penalties against large multinational carmakers swept up in a broad investigation. The fines, which totaled $46 million, were the latest in a series of tough measures by China against what it considers monopolistic practices.

But this month, some signs have appeared that suggest subprime lenders are pushing this spree to the limit. The problems are occurring when they extend credit to particularly risky borrowers or make loans that are harder to repay.

But the eager participation of banks and card companies suggests both Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> clout, and the recognition among financial institutions that they face broader challenges from upstart technology ventures, many of which are not as eager or willing as Apple to work with the incumbent financial industry.
