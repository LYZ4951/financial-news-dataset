PARIS, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> shares will resume trading on Monday after being suspended ahead of the publication of a counteroffer for the French holiday company by Fosun <0656.HK> and the Chinese conglomerate's partners, the French AMF regulator said.

The Sept. 19 closing deadline for an existing offer for Club Med by Global Resorts, controlled by Italian businessman Andrea Bonomi, has now been pushed back to an unspecified date, the AMF said in a statement on Friday.
