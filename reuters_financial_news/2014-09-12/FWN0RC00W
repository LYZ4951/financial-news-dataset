PARIS, Sept 12 (Reuters) - French private equity firm Ardian, Chinese conglomerate Fosun International <0656.HK>, China's U-Tour and Portuguese insurer Fidelidade, said on Friday they would offer 22 euros per share for Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA>, reigniting a battle for control of the French resort operator.

The new offer, which values Club Med at 839 million euros(1.08 billion), tops a 21 euro-per-share takeover bid from Global Resorts, controlled by Italian businessman Andrea Bonomi, which had valued Club Med at 790 million. Bonomi's bid closes on Sept. 19.
