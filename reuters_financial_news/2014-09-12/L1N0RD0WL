NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Derivative strategists at Goldman Sachs see J.C. Penney <JCP.N> shares experiencing more volatility in the run-up to the department store chain's analyst day in early October and recommend buying options straddles to profit from any gyrations in the stock.

"We believe the options market is missing the potential for shares to trade in a wide range over the next month," including the company's analyst day, set for Oct. 8, Goldman Sachs said in a note dated Thursday.  Goldman recommended buying October $11 straddles on J.C. Penney for a premium of $1.25 ahead of the analyst day. Buyers of a straddle, which involves both a call and put with the same strike price and expiration date, benefit from large price fluctuations in the underlying stock. They risk losing the premium paid for the trade if the stock closes at the strike price on expiration. On Friday, J.C. Penney straddles that expire Oct. 18 are pricing in a 10.8 percent move in either direction by that date. The department store chain's shares have gained about 22 percent in value for the year to date. They touched a year-low of $4.90 on Feb. 5 and touched a year-high of $11.28 on Sept. 4. "It is always possible that shares settle into a trading range, but as we approach the holidays investor sentiment is prone to big swings," Goldman said. The 30-day implied volatility in the stock's options was up about 4 percent at 44.41 percent on Friday, according to data from options analytics firm Livevol Inc.
