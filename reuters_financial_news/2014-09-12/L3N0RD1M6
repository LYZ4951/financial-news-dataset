SYDNEY, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Australian industry standards company SAI Global Ltd <SAI.AX> on Friday extended a self-imposed deadline for parties interested in making a takeover bid.

SAI said in May that it would open its books for parties to conduct due diligence with a view to a takeover after Australian private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners made a A$1.1 billion ($997.37 million) indicative offer.
