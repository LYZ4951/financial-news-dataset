Sept 12 (Reuters) - Stock index provider MSCI Inc <MSCI.N> is considering changing its rules that could allow shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd [IPO-BABA.N] and other companies that list their shares in markets away from their home base to be included in its widely used indexes.

Under MSCI's rules, a company cannot be included in its popular Global Investable Markets indexes if it is based in one region and its shares are listed in another region. Because China's Alibaba is listing in New York, it would be excluded from big MSCI indexes.
