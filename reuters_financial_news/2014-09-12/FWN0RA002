PARIS, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Andrea Bonomi is studying options for Club Med <CMIP.PA> after a rival bidder made a counter offer for the French holiday company, a spokesman for the Italian businessman said on Friday.

Chinese conglomerate Fosun <0656.HK> launched a last-minute 22 euro-a-share bid for Club Med earlier on Friday, hours before a deadline for rival proposals to an existing 21 euro offer from Bonomi. [ID:nL5N0RD11U]
