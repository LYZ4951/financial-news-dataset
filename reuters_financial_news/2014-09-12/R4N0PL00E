MOSCOW, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The Russian Central Bank left its key interest rates on hold at a regular meeting on Friday, signalling it is more worried about the sanctions-hit economy than high inflation which remains above the bank's target.

The decision keeps the bank's central policy rate, the one-week minimum auction repo rate, at 8 percent, and was broadly expected. [ID:nL5N0RC304]
