SOFIA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - These are some of the main stories in Bulgarian newspapers on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

-- The World Bank is ready to help Bulgaria reform its energy sector, Interim Regional Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva said after meeting senior bank's officials in Sofia (Standart, Capital daily, 24 Chasa, Duma). -- The World Bank appointed Irishman Antony Thomspon as new country manager for Bulgaria, the bank said in a statement.  PRESA - Bulgaria's Ombudsman Konstantin Penchev expressed his concern with the dragging of the saga around troubled Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, describing it as "outrageous".  -- Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic was quoted as saying the Serbian authorities have no information of the whereabouts of Corpbank's major shareholder Tsvetan Vassilev. Earlier this week, Bulgaria's Interim Prime Minister Georgi Bliznashki said the Bulgarian authorities will discuss the possibility of seeking the extradition of Vassilev, wanted by Interpol, from Serbia. On Friday, the Sofia City Court will deliberate whether to deny the prosecutors' request for a 72-hour detention of Vassilev (24 Chasa, Monitor). -- Bulgaria needs around 3.2 million levs (2.12 million US dollar) to repair flood damage to its rail infrastructure, Interim Transport Minister Nikolina Angelkova said
