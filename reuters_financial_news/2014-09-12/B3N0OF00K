BUDAPEST, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Hungarian lawmakers have not decided about a conversion of foreign currency loans into forints as the decision is untimely now, but such a decision could be made later, ruling party lawmaker Antal Rogan said.

Rogan told a news conference on Friday after a three-day meeting of the ruling Fidesz party that unlike in the case of the settlement of past interest rate and fee hikes deemed unfair by the court, no solid legal basis existed for any such conversion.
