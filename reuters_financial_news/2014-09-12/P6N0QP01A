PARIS, Sept 12 (Reuters) - European shares inched higher early on Friday but remained in a tight range, as investors refrained from taking strong bets on indexes ahead of Scotland's referendum and the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.

At 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,386.54 points, after losing 0.1 percent on Thursday.
