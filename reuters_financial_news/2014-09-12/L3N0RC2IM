SHANGHAI, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Chinese money market rates rose slightly this week after Premier Li Keqiang said a prudent monetary policy would be maintained, but traders forecast seasonal factors will keep liquidity tight for the rest of the month.

The weighted average rate for the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.24 percent at midday on Friday, up 11 basis points from last week's close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> was at 2.84 percent,  edging up only 6 basis points, while the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, another actively traded tenor, also rose 6 basis points on the week to 3.44 percent. "Liquidity is not tight even though the central bank drained money this week, partly because the impact of open market operations has become less significant lately," said a trader at a European bank in Shanghai.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) drained a net 5 billion yuan ($815.33 million) from the interbank markets via open market operations this week. [CN/MMT] Traders expect the liquidity to be relatively tight over the next two weeks, with monthly tax payments in particular putting pressure on money markets next week.  Cash demand for quarter-end regulatory payments and an upcoming week-long national holiday has already been priced into  long-term repo rates this week, they said, with the 21-day repo <CN21DRP=CFXS> standing at 4.40 percent by midday on Friday, up 15 basis points on week.   TARGETED ADJUSTMENT  Credit data for August released on Friday morning helped ease concerns over the economy after signs that the recovery had stumbled in July.   Broad M2 money supply rose 12.8 percent in August from a year earlier, still below the 13.4 percent rise expected by economists. China's total social financing aggregate, a broad measure of liquidity in the economy, was 957.4 billion yuan in August, bouncing from a near six-year low of 273.1 billion yuan in July.[ID:nENNE980S3] However, China's Premier Li Keqiang said China cannot rely on loose credit to lift its economy but will make more "targeted adjustments" to policy in a speech earlier in the week.
