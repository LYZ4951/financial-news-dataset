LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Supporters of keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom hold a two-point lead over supporters of independence, an opinion poll showed on Friday, less than a week before Scots vote in a referendum on whether to split from the United Kingdom.

The ICM survey for the Guardian newspaper put supporters of the union on 51 percent against 49 percent for those in favour of independence, excluding people who said they did not know how they would vote.
