LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - A new nicotine inhaler to be sold by a unit of British American Tobacco <BATS.L> has been licensed in the UK as a medicinal product, marking the arrival of a new competitor in the fast-growing electronic cigarette market.

The Voke Inhaler contains no electronics, heat or combustion and is designed to rival both e-cigarettes and nicotine-replacement therapies, such as gum and patches.
