HONG KONG, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares ended their worst week in six months on Friday, as investors locked in profits amid concerns that China's economy will remain sluggish and a U.S. interest rate rise may come sooner than expected.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> slipped 0.3 percent to 24,595.32 points in its sixth straight daily loss. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 0.2 percent. The two indexes slid 2.6 percent and 3.1 percent this week, respectively, their biggest weekly loss since the week ended March 14. Chinese state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd <0267.HK> sank 4.1 percent to a two-month low after Hong Kong's securities regulator launched legal proceedings against the company and five former directors.
