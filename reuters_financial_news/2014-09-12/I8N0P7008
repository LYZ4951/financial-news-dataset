MUMBAI, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged higher, snapping three days of falls as blue chips such as ITC Ltd <ITC.NS> recovered, but broader advances were capped by caution ahead of inflation data and mild selling by foreign investors.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.26 percent higher while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> added 0.24 percent.
