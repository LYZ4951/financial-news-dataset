NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Retailers were among the better performers on Friday, edging higher after data showed U.S. retail sales rose broadly in August and consumer sentiment hit a 14-month high in September. [ID:nL1N0RD0OS]

The Morgan Stanley retail index <.MVR> jumped 0.9 percent; the S&P 500 retail index <.SPXRT> was up 0.1 percent. Leading the percentage gainers on the Morgan Stanley index was Ulta Salon Cosmetics and Fragrance <ULTA.O>, which jumped 20.2 percent after raising its full-year same-store sales growth forecast late Thursday. Among other top retail gainers, Best Buy <BBY.N> was up 2 percent, Staples <SPLS.O> was up 1.8 percent and Lululemon Athletica <LULU.O> was up 2.9 percent. Several brokerages raised their price targets on Lululemon, which reported a better-than-expected profit on Thursday. Retailers as a group have had a tough year, with early sales hurt by a severe U.S. winter. The Morgan Stanley index is up just 0.9 percent for the year so far, while the S&P retail index is up 0.3 percent.
