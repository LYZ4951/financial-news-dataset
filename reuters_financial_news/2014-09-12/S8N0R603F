HONG KONG, Sept 12 (Reuters) - China shares rose on Friday, as August lending data helped ease some growth fears and two shipbuilding conglomerates led gains on reforms in that industry.

Chinese banks made 702.5 billion yuan ($114.6 billion) of new loans in August, picking up from an abrupt drop the previous month. [ID:nL3N0RD18J] The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> climbed 0.9 percent to 2,331.95 points and was up 0.2 percent for the week. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings closed up 0.6 percent on Friday, snapping a three-day losing streak. It shed 0.4 percent this week.  Among top index boosts, China Shipbuilding Industry <601989.SS> soared 5.1 percent and China CSSC Holdings <600150.SS> surged by the 10 percent daily limit. For the two companies, asset consolidation is accelerating in line with reforms in the defense industry, the official Shanghai Securities News said on Friday.
