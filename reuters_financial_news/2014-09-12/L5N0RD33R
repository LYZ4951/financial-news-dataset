FRANKFURT, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Bailed-out German bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) [HRESH.UL], whose chief executive stepped down after a surprise government policy shift prevented the sale of a unit, has appointed new heads to jointly run the bank.

HRE Chief Financial Officer Andreas Arndt as well as former Eurohypo [NHYGE.UL] Chief Executive Thomas Koentgen will serve as new co-CEOs from October, the lender said in a statement on Friday. Germany nationalised HRE after it collapsed in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the government injected 10 billion euros ($13 billion) in capital and offered 145 billion euros in liquidity guarantees to the stricken lender. As a prerequisite for the bailout, the European Commission ordered HRE to sell its public finance unit Depfa [HRXGP.UL] in 2014 and its mortgage lender Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (PBB)[NUEG.UL] in 2015.  In May, HRE was on the brink of selling Depfa to U.S.-based investor Leucadia <LUK.N> and its partner Massachusetts Mutual [MMLIC.UL]. [ID:nWEB00N5N][ID:nL6N0NZ1RO].  But in an about-face, Germany's bank bailout fund Soffin came to the conclusion that taxpayers would be better served if it winds down the unit itself. It overruled the HRE board and Chief Executive Manuela Better, who had advocated the sale.
