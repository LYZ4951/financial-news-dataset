NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc <HSBA.L> is expected to pay $550 million to resolve a U.S. regulator's claims the bank made false representations in selling mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> before the financial crisis, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

A settlement could be announced as soon as later Friday between HSBC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the conservator for the two government-controlled mortgage finance companies, the person said.
