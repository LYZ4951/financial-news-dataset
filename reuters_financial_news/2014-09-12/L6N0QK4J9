SOFIA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - All major shareholders in Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank <6C9.BB> are seeking state backing to draw up a rescue plan for the troubled lender, Vienna-based financial consultancy EPIC said in a statement on Friday.

EPIC, on behalf of the major shareholders, said it had sent a letter to the Bulgarian central bank and government, seeking their support to work together on a restructuring and recapitalisation plan for the country's fourth-largest lender. EPIC also proposed a meeting in Sofia next week with the central bank to request that the consultancy conduct a full due diligence on the lender.Tsvetan Vassilev controls over half of the bank, an Omani sovereign fund has about a 30 percent stake and Russia's VTB Capital, part of VTB Bank <VTBR.MM>, has around 9 percent.
