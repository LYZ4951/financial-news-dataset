PRAGUE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank (CNB) set the countercyclical buffer for commercial banks at zero as of next month, saying on Friday that it saw no need to raise it in the next two years because economic risk is subdued.

"(The cyclical source) of systemic risk is low and does not require the creation of a countercyclical capital buffer for exposures located in the Czech Republic," the bank said in a statement on its website. The central bank said last October it would not activate all capital buffers possible under Europe's new regulatory framework, which seeks to raise banks' resilience in crises.  It however did slap individual systemic risk capital requirements on the country's four core lenders.

Analysts expect them to stay profitable even though record low interest rates make the environment trickier. [ID:nL5N0QQ2BD] "Given the current predictions of future credit growth and developments on the relevant markets - the property market in particular - it will probably not be necessary to apply a non-zero countercyclical capital buffer rate in the next two years," the CNB said.
