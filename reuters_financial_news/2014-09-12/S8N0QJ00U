LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Britain will become the first Western government to issue an offshore bond in renminbi, finance minister George Osborne said on Friday.

"I can now announce that the UK government intends to be the first national government outside of China to issue a bond in China's currency," said Osborne, speaking at a meeting in London with Chinese vice premier Ma Kai. "We have issued bonds in U.S. dollars before. Now we will issue a bond in renminbi."
