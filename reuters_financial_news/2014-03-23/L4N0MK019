TOKYO, March 23 (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd <8309.T> and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will team up with British private equity group CVC Capital Partners Ltd [CVC.UL] to set up an Asian investment fund totalling more than 300 billion yen ($2.93 billion), the Nikkei business daily said on Sunday.
