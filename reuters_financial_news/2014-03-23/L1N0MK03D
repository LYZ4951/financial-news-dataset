March 23 (Reuters) - Principal Financial Group Inc <PFG.N> shares could rise 25 percent if the company is valued more as a global money manager, as opposed to an insurance company, according to an article in the March 24 edition of Barron's.

The current stock price does not reflect Principal's position as a money manager with $483 billion in assets, the article said.
