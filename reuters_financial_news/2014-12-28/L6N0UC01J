DUBAI, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets may consolidate on Sunday, with positive news on Saudi Arabia's budget now largely factored in and the Brent oil price back below $60 a barrel.

Markets rose on Thursday after Riyadh released a 2015 state budget that maintains spending at high levels, reassuring the region that economic growth is unlikely to be hurt much by the plunge of oil revenues. [ID:nL6N0U90AZ] Retail investors' concerns about government spending cuts were the main reason behind the panic sell-off that briefly wiped out all year-to-date gains in most Gulf markets earlier this month. However, oil prices fell again on Friday as the dollar strengthened and as a supply glut in top consumer United States trumped worries about falling exports from Libya. Brent closed on Friday at $59.45 per barrel - while this is no longer likely to cause panic among Gulf retail investors given the Saudi budget news, it is still negative. [O/R] On global markets, U.S. stocks rose on Friday while most other bourses were closed for Christmas holidays. [MKTS/GLOB]
