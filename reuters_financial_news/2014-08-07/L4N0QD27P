BEIJING, Aug 7 (Reuters) - A growing number of Chinese cities are relaxing property controls to support a cooling market and safeguard the country's economic growth.    The unwinding of property controls is a turning point in China's housing policy, which has been steadily tightened since 2009 to contain frothy home prices. [ID:nL4N0Q42GK]

Many analysts now believe the slowing property market is the biggest risk to the world's second-largest economy. In China, regional government earn a large chunk of their revenue by selling state land. Out of 46 such governments that introduced home-purchase restrictions, at least 28 of them have openly or quietly relaxed such curbs this year, according to data from CRIC, a unit of real estate services firm E-House China <EJ.N>. But others have not budged, with higher downpayment levels and limits on the number of homes that residents can buy still in place for a fifth year to temper house prices, CRIC said.  Here is a compilation of measures taken to bolster the property market.  ** Below are the cities that have removed limits on the number of homes that residents and non-residents alike can buy, allowing them to own more than one home: Changsha of Hunan Province (Aug 6) Taiyuan of Shanxi Province (Aug 4) Shaoxing of Zhejiang Province (Aug 4) Hefei of Anhui Province (Aug 2) Jinhua of Zhejiang Province (Aug 1) Xuzhou of Jiangsu Province (Aug 1)  Wenzhou of Zhejiang Province (July 29) Shijiazhuang of Hebei Province (July 28)  Haikou of Hainan Province (July 23) Jinan of Shandong Province (July 10) Hohhot of Inner Mongolia Region (June 27)  ** The following cities have relaxed home purchase restrictions with conditions: * Foshan of Guangdong Province (Aug 7) Individuals who are registered as residents can buy two homes and non-residents who do not own any property in the city can buy a house.
