FRANKFURT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Private equity groups Triton and Capvis are preparing a sale of Wittur, a German maker of elevator components, trying to benefit from high valuations in buyout markets, two people familiar with the matter said.

The investors have mandated Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> to organise the transaction, in which Wittur may be valued at roughly 700 million euros ($935.13 million), the people said, adding that preparations are still at an early stage. The company, founded in 1968 by then 26-year old Horst Wittur with a start-up capital of about 1,000 euros, currently has annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of about 80 million euros. Elevator makers such as Kone <KNEBV.HE> and Schindler <SCHP.VX> trade at 11 and 14 times their expected earnings respectively, a valuation that Wittur may struggle to see, one of the sources said. Triton acquired a majority in Wittur, which is based in Wiedenzhausen near Munich, in 2010 from Goldman Sachs, Cerberus and Credit Suisse for an undisclosed sum. Capvis at the time bought a 28 percent holding in the company and the Wittur management also took a stake.   Wittur's products include lift machines, elevator doors, hydraulic devices, safety components, gearless drives and slings.
