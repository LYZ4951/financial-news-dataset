SAO PAULO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Fewer working days and weak trading volumes in the second quarter likely hampered results at Brazilian financial exchange BM&FBovespa SA, but clearinghouse Cetip SA Mercados Organizados is still expected to post record profits, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Thursday.

Cetip <CTIP3.SA> and BM&FBovespa <BVMF3.SA> are to unveil results late on Thursday. Trading activity was weak for both firms in the quarter, but in the case of Cetip, the resilience of its business model and new products bolstered earnings. Almost four years of weak economic expansion and rising government meddling in the economy have stifled investor confidence in Brazil, cutting equity market inflows and triggering price volatility. Optimism that the October presidential election will bring about a more business-friendly policy has been bolstering market activity in recent weeks. "The challenging macroeconomic environment should weigh more on BM&FBovespa as volumes remain sluggish," said Domingos Falavina, an analyst with JPMorgan Securities. BM&FBovespa results should come in weak both annually and quarterly. Net income probably slumped 29.1 percent from a year earlier to an average 249 million reais, the poll found. Profit probably fell 2.9 percent on a quarterly basis. Equities and derivatives volumes probably sank 18.7 percent and 37.9 percent from the prior quarter, respectively, driving net revenue down to 488 million reais, the poll found. Expenses likely fell 4.2 percent, pushing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization up 5.8 percent. EBITDA, as the indicator is known, is a gauge of operational profit.  In the case of Cetip, operating numbers are expected to show clearing and custody activities doing well. The liens unit had small volume growth but has slowly begun to recover, the poll found. Net income at the Sao Paulo-based company likely reached a record-high 106 million reais ($47 million) in the quarter, up 16.7 percent from a year earlier and 6.5 percent sequentially, the poll found. On an annual basis, net revenue likely soared 6.2 percent, while general expenses were down 1.1 percent, the poll found.  EBITDA probably rose 0.6 percent on an annual basis, to 168 million reais.
