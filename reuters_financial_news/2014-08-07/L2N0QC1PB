WASHINGTON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Government-controlled mortgage finance firm Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> said on Thursday it will pay U.S. taxpayers $3.7 billion after posting a quarterly profit.

Once it has made the latest payment in September, it will have returned $130.5 billion to taxpayers in return for the $116.1 billion in taxpayer aid it received after being placed under the government's wing at the height of the financial crisis.
