FRANKFURT, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Germany's second biggest lender Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> said it is speeding up the clean up of non-core assets as it posted an increase in second-quarter earnings.

"We have raised our current reduction target of 75 billion euros for 2016 once again," Chief Financial Officer Stephan Engels said in a statement on Thursday. The bank now aims to shrink its commercial real estate and ship finance portfolios to 20 billion euros and the public finance portfolio to 47 billion euros.
