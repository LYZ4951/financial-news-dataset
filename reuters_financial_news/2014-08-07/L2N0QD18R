Aug 7 (Reuters) - Three private equity firms have agreed to pay $325 million to settle a lawsuit accusing them of colluding with rivals to keep prices down on corporate takeovers prior to the financial crisis by agreeing not to outbid each other.

Blackstone Group LP <BX.N>, KKR & Co <KKR.N> and TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL] will apportion the payment among themselves, according to a filing in the U.S. District Court in Boston. The settlement will benefit shareholders of merger targets, and resolve the private equity firms' portions of the nearly seven-year-old lawsuit. None of the firms admitted wrongdoing.
