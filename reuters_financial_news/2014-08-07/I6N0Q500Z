MILAN, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Credito Valtellinese <PCVI.MI> plans to borrow up to 1 billion euros in fresh longer-term funds the European Central Bank will offer lenders starting from September in a bid to spur lending to companies, its chief executive said on Thursday.

"At the first round, in September, we're planning to ask for funds worth around 900 million to 1 billion euros," Creval CEO Miro Fiordi told analysts on a conference call. Creval on Thursday reported an 11 percent rise in first-half net profit as sharply higher loan loss provisions partly offset rising interest and trading income, and said the cost of credit would continue to weigh on profitability.
