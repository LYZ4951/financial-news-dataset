Aug 7 (Reuters) - Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> said on Thursday they would pay dividends totaling $5.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury next month, pushing taxpayers further into the black on their bailout of the mortgage finance firms. [ID:nL2N0QD0IH]

After the payments, the companies will have sent a combined $218.7 billion in dividends to the Treasury in return for the $187.5 billion in taxpayer aid they received after being seized by the government at the height of the financial crisis.
