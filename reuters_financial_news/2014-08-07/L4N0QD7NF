SYDNEY, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen retreating further from 3-week lows on Friday, after Wall Street extended its losses on concerns  the tensions between Russia and the West and tit-for-tat sactions may hit global growth.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.4 percent, an 83.0-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark dipped 0.1 percent on Thursday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> slipped 0.2 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday, continuing a recent streak of weakness as Russia's surprisingly harsh retaliatory measures in response to Western sanctions raised concerns about global growth.  * Moscow banned imports of most food from the West on Thursday in retaliation against sanctions over Ukraine, a stronger than expected measure that isolates Russian consumers from world trade to a degree unseen since Soviet days.[ID:nL6N0QD41M] * Nickel prices rose to a 1-1/2 week high, lifted by the closure of a mine in Papua New Guina and the prospect that wider Western sanctions against Russia could affect the major producer of the metal.  * Gold prices rose as safe-haven buying amid rising tensions in Iraq and Ukraine extended the previous session's rally, and analysts said the metal could gain further after having breached key technical resistance.  *  Two of Asia's richest men won shareholder approval to buy Australian property and infrastructure firms for a combined A$4.5 billion on Thursday, extending the rush of offshore investors to tap the country's high-yield, low-risk assets. [ID:nL4N0QD7BX] * Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto <RIO.AX> <RIO.L> raised hopes it could sharply boost cash returns to investors after topping market forecasts with a 21 percent rise in first-half profit. [ID:nL4N0QC1JG] * News Corp <NWS.AX> <NWSA.O> will announce its fourth quarter earnings later in the day, while Australia-mortgage lending data is also due later on Friday. ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2306 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1909.57 -0.56%   -10.670 USD/JPY <JPY=>   102.05  -0.04%-0.040 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.4095  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1311.2  -0.15%-2.000 US CRUDE<CLc1>   97.430.09% 0.090 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16368.27-0.46%-75.07 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  150.05  -0.32% -0.48 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St ends down on heightened Russia concerns [.N]   * Oil prices rise on reports U.S. mulling airstrikes on Iraqi militants[O/R]   * Gold turns higher on technical buying as tensions rise[GOL/]   * Nickel rises on Russia sanctions concerns, copper gains[MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB] DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
