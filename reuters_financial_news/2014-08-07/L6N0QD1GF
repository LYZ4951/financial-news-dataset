LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - UK insurer RSA <RSA.L> posted an interim pretax profit of 69 million pounds ($116.20 million) on Thursday and said it was making good progress in stabilising its financial health after a year of upheaval following problems at its Irish unit.

RSA said interim tangible equity was 2.6 billion pounds, up from 1.7 billion at the end of December, although net written premiums fell 3.9 billion pounds, down 9 percent or 3 percent on a underlying basis.
