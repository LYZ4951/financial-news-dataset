LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline <GSK.L>, Britain's biggest drugs company, is close to appointing Philip Hampton as its next chairman, in a move that will coincide with his departure from Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>, Sky News said on Thursday.

Sky said GSK could announce Hampton's appointment next month. It said he is likely to join GSK as a non-executive director or deputy chairman and move into the chairman's seat in 2015. He would replace Christopher Gent, who has been at GSK for almost a decade and said earlier this year he planned to announce a successor this year with a view to standing down in 2015. Hampton has been RBS's chairman since February 2009 when he was parachuted in to help rescue the bank. GSK and RBS declined to comment.
