Aug 7 (Reuters) - Anglo-South African financial group Old Mutual <OML.L> reported a 17 percent increase in first-half adjusted operating profit on Thursday, helped by strength at its South African businesses and its wealth management unit.

The FTSE 100 insurer said, however, that it expected the external conditions for its emerging markets businesses to continue to be challenging in the next six months. [ID:nJseG0006a]
