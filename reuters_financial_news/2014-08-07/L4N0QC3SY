TOKYO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, Japan's top cross-border mergers and acquisitions advisor last year, has 50 percent more deals in the pipeline compared with the same time a year earlier, its chief executive said.

The joint venture of Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T> earlier this year advised on Suntory Holdings Ltd's $13.6 billion acquisition of U.S. whiskey maker Beam Inc, a deal which also involved a bridge loan of up to 1.4 trillion yen ($13.69 billion). Chief Executive Takashi Nagaoka told Reuters that Japanese business leaders seem to be bolder about embarking on global M&A, including leveraged deals, as Japan's shrinking population encourages them to look beyond their home market.
