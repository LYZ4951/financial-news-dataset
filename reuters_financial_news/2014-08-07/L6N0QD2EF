LISBON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp <BCP.LS> slumped over 10 percent in early trading on Thursday and other banks also fell sharply on investor concerns lenders will end up paying for the recent rescue of rival Banco Espirito Santo by the state.

The fall in BCP, which followed a 15 percent plunge the previous day, came despite a one-day ban on short selling in the stock imposed by Portugal's CMVM securities market regulator late on Wednesday. Portugal's PSI20 <.PSI20> stock index was 3.4 percent in the red at 0745 GMT. Investors are concerned that banks who contribute to bank recapitalisation fund through which the state injected 4.9 billion euros to carve out a healthy new bank out of Banco Espirito Santo (BES) may end up paying a chunk of the rescue bill.
