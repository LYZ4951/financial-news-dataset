MILAN, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Italy's Credito Emiliano <EMBI.MI> posted on Thursday a 39 pecent rise in first-half net profit to 99 million euros helped by higher interest and trading income, rising fees and the fact it put aside less money against loan losses than a year earlier.

Credem, one of 15 Italian banks under scrutiny in a pan-European banking review, said its best-quality Common Equity Tier 1 ratio stood at around 11.2 percent of risk-weighted assets - above an 8 percent threshold for banks in the review. Loans to clients in the period rose 2.8 percent, bucking a trend of shrinking credit in Italy, whose economy slid back into recession in the second quarter.  The bank said in a statement credit risk could have a larger impact on profitability in the future due to the protracted weakness of the domestic economy.
