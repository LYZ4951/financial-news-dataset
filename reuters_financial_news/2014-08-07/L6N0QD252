MOSCOW, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Russia's second-largest bank VTB <VTBR.MM>, which has been sanctioned by the United States and European Union over the Ukraine crisis, said on Thursday it doesn't plan to issue any new shares before end of this year or during all of next year.

Last week, international stock index compiler MSCI Barra said it was consulting with investors about whether to exclude VTB's shares from one of its indices.
