MILAN, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Shares in mid-tier Italian lenders Banca Popolare Emilia Romagna (BPER) <EMII.MI> and Credito Valtellinese <PCVI.MI> fell sharply on Thursday after the two banks posted first-half results which traders said showed no improvement in asset quality.

Shares in BPER fell 11 percent before trade in the stock was suspended. By 1510 GMT shares in Creval fell 8.4 percent against a 3 percent fall in Italy's banking stock index <.FTIT8300>. Analysts said the results showed that loan loss provisions remained high in the second quarter, which saw the Italian economy slip back into recession. Creval's loan loss provisions soared 70 percent in the first half from a year earlier. BPER said its own provisions had fallen around 5 percent, a much smaller decline than that reported by banks such as Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>.   Small Italian bank Credito Emiliano <EMBI.MI>, which also reported first-half results on Thursday, was down 3 percent.
