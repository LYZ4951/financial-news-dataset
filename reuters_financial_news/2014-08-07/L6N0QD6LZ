LISBON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Henrique Granadeiro, the chief executive officer of Portugal Telecom SGPS <PTC.LS>, resigned on Thursday, the company said, three weeks after it was forced to take a cut in its share of a merger with Brazil's Oi due to a debt deal that went wrong.

Portugal Telecom had failed to inform its Brazilian merger partner Oi <OIBR3.SA> that it held 900 million euros in debt issued by a holding company of the crumbling business empire of Portugal's Espirito Santo banking family.
