TORONTO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp <MFC.TO> said on Thursday its second-quarter profit more than tripled due to a stronger performance by investments and other market-related factors, and Canada's biggest life insurer raised its dividend for the first time since 2009.

Manulife said net income attributed to shareholders was C$943 million, or 49 Canadian cents a share, compared with C$259 million, or 12 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
