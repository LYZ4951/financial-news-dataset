HONG KONG, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished near two-week lows on Thursday, weighed down by an underperforming Macau gambling sector which was hurt by disappointing July revenue.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> slumped 0.8 percent to 24,387.56 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was off 0.9 percent. Gambling stocks were some of the heaviest hit after Deutsche Bank lowered third-quarter and full-year revenue forecasts for the sector this year, citing softer VIP volume and slower growth for mass table revenue last month. Also aggravating investors' concerns is a labour shortage the operators are facing as they rush to build more casinos. Labour strains look set to intensify with workers demanding higher pay and threatening strikes. [ID:nL4N0Q64JC] Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> and Sands China <1928.HK> led losses on the Hang Seng, diving 6.4 and 5.8 percent, respectively. Some other casinos shed between 3 percent and 8 percent.
