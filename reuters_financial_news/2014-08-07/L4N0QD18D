BANGKOK, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Thai shares trimmed some of their early losses on Thursday as a strong consumer confidence index lifted broader sentiment, while the Philippine benchmark snapped a two-day losing streak, with strong earnings further boosting shares of Globe Telecom <GLO.PS>.

The consumer confidence index <THCONF=ECI> of the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce rose in July to an 11-month high, reflecting optimism around the military's infrastructure plans and the outlook of domestic economy next year. [ID:nAAN0OG01L][nL4N0QC3KG] Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> was nearly flat near the midday trading break. It earlier lost about 0.5 percent amid weaknesses in Asian stock markets. Gainers included Kasikornbank <KBAN.BK> while the recently-rallying Advanced Info Service shares retreated <ADVANC.BK>. Shares of the state-run Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> regained lost ground after a big lot deal at a higher-than-market price. [ID:nSQBdQB5b] Short-term trading dominated the Thai stock market ahead of a long weekend. The SET index was expected to move in a range of 1,510-1,530, broker Phillip Securities said. The market will be shut on Aug. 11-12 for a public holiday. "Each investor category has continued to engage in short-term trading activities, which would limit the markets upside and make the market more sensitive to any negative news flow," the broker said in a report. In Manila, the key index <.PSI> edged up 0.3 percent as shares of Globe Telecom extended gains from the previous day after the company posted strong earnings for the six months ended June 30. [ID:nL4N0QC0BT] Large caps fell across exchanges as Asia saw investors flocking to safe haven assets on Thursday, spooked by a Russian troop build-up on the border with Ukraine and tit-for-tat economic sanctions between the West and Moscow. [MKTS/GLOB] Singapore's index <.FTSTI> hit the lowest since July 18, led by shares of DBS Group Holdings <DBSM.SI>. Malaysia's  Tenaga Nasional <TENA.KL> and Indonesia's Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> led among the losers in the region.
