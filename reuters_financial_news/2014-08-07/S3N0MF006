STOCKHOLM, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Swedish finance minister Anders Borg said on Thursday he did not expect Swedish companies affected by Russia sanctions to be compensated by the state.

Asked if the state, either on its own or with the European Union, could consider compensating Swedish companies affected by sanctions against and by Russia, Borg told reporters: "I don't think that one should imagine that companies are compensated somehow here." Borg also said that so far it looked like the sanctions would have relatively small effects on the Swedish economy.
