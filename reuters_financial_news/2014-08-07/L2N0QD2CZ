TORONTO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - TMX Group Ltd <X.TO>, the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, took a massive writedown on its U.S. options investment that pushed it to a loss in the second quarter, but it reported a 13 percent rise in adjusted profit on flat revenue on Thursday.

The net loss attributable to shareholders was C$26.4 million, or a loss of 49 Canadian cents per share, compared with a profit of C$25.5 million, or 47 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.
