SEOUL, Aug 7 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> eased on Thursday after surprisingly dismal Australian jobs data hurt sentiment for risky assets after midday, while shares extended losses as institutions shed them for profits.

The local currency <KRW=KFTC> ended onshore trade down 0.4 percent at 1,037.6 against the dollar while the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.3 percent at 2,054.51 points in its third day of declines. Institutions were not sellers of 154.7 billion won ($149.14 million) worth of South Korean shares.
