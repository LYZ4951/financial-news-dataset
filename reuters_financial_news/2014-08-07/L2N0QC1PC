WASHINGTON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Government-controlled mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> said on Thursday it will pay U.S. taxpayers $1.9 billion after posting an eleventh straight quarterly profit.

Once it has made the latest payment in September, it will have returned $88.2 billion to taxpayers in return for the $71.3 billion in aid it received after being placed under the government's wing at the height of the financial crisis.
