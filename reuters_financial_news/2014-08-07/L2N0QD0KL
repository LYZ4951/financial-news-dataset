SAO PAULO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Grupo BTG Pactual SA <BBTG11.SA>, the largest independent Latin American investment-banking firm, plans an offering of hybrid securities whose size could surpass that of a benchmark-sized sale to help pay for the purchase of Swiss wealth manager BSI Group SA, a senior executive told Reuters.

Jõao Dantas, BTG Pactual's head of investor relations, said late on Wednesday that the offer might happen in September or October. "It makes no sense doing a small deal," he said. A benchmark-sized deal is typically around $500 million. Hybrid securities generally combine both debt and equity characteristics. More Brazilian banks, including state-run Caixa Econômica Federal [CEF.UL] and Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA>, have pursued the sale of such instruments this year to meet investor demand for complex securities while making their capital structure more efficient.  São Paulo-based BTG Pactual, which is controlled by billionaire financier André Esteves, struck a deal last month to buy BSI from Assicurazioni Generali SpA <GASI.MI> for about $1.7 billion to help build a global private-banking platform. BTG Pactual will pay 80 percent of the price in cash and the rest in stock. BTG Pactual also sees the hybrid securities as an instrument to help bolster capital ahead of the implementation of Basel III rules in Brazil. Sources told Reuters that BTG Pactual had several financing options in mind, including the use of cash, a capital increase and the sale of securities that could be booked as part of its capital. The acquisition would almost double BTG Pactual's assets under management to more than $200 billion. Aside from beefing up asset and wealth management, BTG has been building a global commodities franchise to help offset flagging investment-banking and trading activity in Brazil. In July, BTG Pactual also said it would acquire Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd's reinsurance unit, Ariel Re. During an earnings conference call with investors on Wednesday, Esteves and Chief Financial Officer Marcelo Kalim ruled out an imminent share offering to help pay for BSI. Currently, BTG Pactual's capital regulatory ratio is around 16 percent, compared with a minimum threshold of 11 percent.
