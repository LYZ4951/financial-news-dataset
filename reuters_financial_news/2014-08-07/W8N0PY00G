WARSAW, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Polish mid-sized lender Alior Bank <ALRR.WA> is on track to achieve 50-percent net profit growth in 2014 from 220 million zlotys ($70 million) in 2013, Chief Executive Officer said on Thursday.

CEO Wojciech Sobieraj told Reuters in an interview that he expects the bank would not pay a dividend in the next two years, as it needs money to fund growth.
