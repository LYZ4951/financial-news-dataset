SAO PAULO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions in Brazil could gain steam once the October presidential election is decided, allowing buyers to forget political risk and instead focus on the country's long-term potential, a banker at Itaú BBA said in an interview.

Itaú BBA's M&A pipeline is currently the bank's largest ever after its deal mandates grew between 15 percent and 20 percent from last year, said Fernando Meira, head of M&A at the São Paulo-based bank. Geographical and sectoral diversification is growing as Itaú expands outside Brazil, he added. Almost four years of subpar growth, a weaker currency and declining profits have driven Brazilian asset prices lower and boosted the appeal of takeover targets in the country. Yet, some acquisition hunters have remained cautious ahead of the election, making it harder for bids and offers to converge before then. "The slowdown that we are witnessing was expected and is natural. Once the election is over, we ought to see activity resuming in good fashion," Meira said. In the year through Wednesday, Itaú BBA topped Brazil M&A advisory rankings after working on 44 deals, almost twice as many as second-ranked Grupo BTG Pactual SA <BBTG11.SA>, Thomson Reuters data showed. Itaú came in second in fees earned, just behind BTG Pactual, with about $50 million in proceeds, according to Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting data. Meira said strategic buyers will gradually brush caution aside and pursue greater exposure to Brazil, some in search of a specific asset and others to tap the country's massive consumer base and need for infrastructure. Buyout firms are also on the prowl, eyeing targets in sectors such as financial services and technology, while also looking to exit some investments. Parent Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA> is expanding in Latin America to help Itaú BBA's Brazilian clients seek new destinations for their money and boost credit and specialized financial services for companies in the region. Tapping revenue sources in markets outside Brazil could help Itaú offset slowing growth, rising inflation and payroll costs, and growing state intervention in Brazil. The economies and capital markets of countries like Chile, Colombia and Peru are expanding faster than Brazil's. Itaú was one of the advisers to Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O> in its purchase of the 20 percent stake it did not own of Chilean telecommunications and cable television provider VTR GlobalCom SA, in a deal valued at about $440 million.
