PARIS, Aug 7 (Reuters) - European stock market operator Euronext <ENX.PA> posted a 4.6 percent rise in second-quarter operating profit before exceptional items on Thursday, boosted by cost cutting and a rise in stock market listings activity.

Euronext, the operator of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses, said second-quarter revenue rose 5.2 percent, helped by a sharp rise in listings as well as a pick up in volumes in its cash trading business.
