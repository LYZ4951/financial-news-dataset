TOKYO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Japanese financial authorities are joining forces to scrutinise for the first time banks' exposure to a potential spike in interest rates, with a focus on the risks to regional lenders when the central bank eventually ends its massive easing.

While the risks look small now with Japan's economy recovering and interest rates extremely low, the nation's 105 regional banks represent the weak link in the financial system. With local economies depopulating in this fast-ageing society, loan demand tepid and scant resources to seek profits overseas, regional lenders have little alternative for their huge deposits but to hold Japanese government bonds.  The Financial Services Agency and the Bank of Japan are scrutinising the smaller lenders' interest-rate risk as they jointly step up their "macroprudential" oversight - looking to identify and minimise risks to the financial system amid broad shifts in the economy, people involved in the process say.  "At present, interest rates are very low and stable, but we don't know when or how the financial environment will change," the FSA's new commissioner, Kiyoshi Hosomizo, told regional bank heads in a private meeting last month, according to a person who attended the meeting.  Regional banks, which sit below the five major banks in Japan's financial pyramid, have total deposits and loans roughly equal to the biggest lenders but are largely tied to shrinking local economies outside the vibrant big cities. They vary greatly, with the market value of the listed banks ranging from over $7 billion for the Bank of Yokohama Ltd <8332.T> just outside Tokyo, to barely $50 million for Howa Bank Ltd <8559.FU> in the western city of Oita. The FSA, the financial industry regulator, has been prodding regional lenders to consider mergers and acquisitions for greater efficiency to cope with the bleak economic outlook. So far, the local bank chiefs have shown no willingness to give up their local fiefdoms and consolidate. [ID:nL4N0Q62WN]  REGULATORS TEAM UP Earlier in June, the FSA and BOJ set up a joint task force to share information on the nation's financial institutions, with a new focus on systemic risks. The rate risk for regional banks was highlighted in a July report by the bank regulator. The FSA's future stress tests will include simulations of higher rates on banks and the broader financial system, one source said. Spokesmen for the FSA and BOJ declined to comment. The FSA is expected to put more focus on macroprudential oversight when it compiles its annual bank-inspection guidelines in the next month or so, people familiar with the inspection process say. It is unclear if the authorities will take new regulatory action.  The FSA, whose inspections have focused on the health of individual banks, is tapping the BOJ's expertise on financial-system stability to ensure a smooth transition out of nearly two decades of deflation, the sources say. While BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda says it is too early to discuss winding down the central bank's 16-month-old "quantitative and qualitative easing", the recent attention on interest-rate risk shows that in practical terms Japan's financial authorities have begun eyeing the exit. Kuroda's central bank has crushed Japan's market interest rates - the 10-year JGB yields barely 0.5 percent - by purchasing 70 percent of the government's debt issuance in an unprecedented monetary easing. Policymakers worry that if growth picks up or investors think the central bank is moving toward tapering its purchases, interest rates could jump and the value of the JGBs held by the country's regional lenders would get hit in particular.  The BOJ estimates that most banks have capital buffers to withstand a 2 percentage-point rise in long-term rates. But a 1-point rise would hit regional banks with 3 trillion yen ($29 billion) in valuation losses on their JGB holdings, more than the 2.6 trillion yen estimate for the more profitable major banks.  LAGGING THE MAJORS Regional banks hold less in JGBs than the major banks relative to deposits or assets. But policymakers privately worry that the smaller lenders have made little progress in trimming their bond holdings while remaining reliant on longer-term debt and lacking other outlets for their cash.  Since the global financial crisis, Japan's major banks have greatly reduced their interest-rate risk by shortening the duration of the debt they hold - making them less vulnerable to rising long-term yields - and selling down their government bond holdings, the FSA said last month in its Financial Monitoring Report. Regional banks, by contrast, have offset their JGB decreases by purchasing corporate debt, the report says. Major banks slashed debt with more than five years to maturity to 13 percent of their holdings by March 2013 from 23 percent in 2008, while regional banks held flat at about 50 percent in longer-term debt, according to data compiled by Japan Macro Advisors. The BOJ says Japan's banking system remains sound with no immediate signs of financial imbalances. But the BOJ is becoming more mindful of the potential drawbacks of its easing and the market volatility it may cause when it starts to wind down the stimulus. "In general, it's true that prolonged monetary loosening could lead to future financial imbalances as markets engage in excessive risk-taking," Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso told a news conference last month.
