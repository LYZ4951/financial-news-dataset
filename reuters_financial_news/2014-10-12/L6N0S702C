DUBAI, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Bourses in the Middle East look set to come under pressure on Sunday after risk aversion drove down global equity markets and oil prices hit a four-year low on Friday.

Western investors fled to the safety of government bonds after a raft of weak indicators from Europe and China collided with concerns about the U.S. Federal Reserve's plans to reduce monetary stimulus. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 0.7 percent on Friday, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq Composite index <.IXIC> dropped 2.3 percent. The MSCI all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> ended down 1.6 percent to hit its lowest level since February. [ID:nL2N0S52IT] Brent crude oil <LCOc1> also came under pressure, touching its lowest level since December 2010 at $88.11, though it recovered to $90.21 by the end of Friday on short-covering. Although oil-rich Gulf states can easily deal with a temporary decrease in oil prices thanks to their large reserves and strong private sectors, a sharp drop - $25 per barrel since June - is likely to affect local investors' mood. [ID:nL6N0RT0KU] Markets in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman were closed throughout last week for the Eid al-Adha holiday, and the global market environment has deteriorated considerably during that period, so they are likely to play catch-up to falls elsewhere.  Bourses in the UAE largely followed the negative global lead last week, while Egypt was in a bearish mood - although cheaper oil is positive for the Egyptian economy, weaker global economic growth is negative, as is the possibility that Gulf investors could become more risk-averse. The Saudi stock index <.TASI>, which last closed at 10,851 points, has immediate chart support at 10,614 points, the September low. Any clean break would point to a test of resistance on the 100-day average, now at 10,238 points.
