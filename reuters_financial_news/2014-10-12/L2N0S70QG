Oct 12 (Reuters) - The euro is very likely to keep weakening against other major currencies, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny was quoted on Sunday as saying.

Nowotny said this was due to the difference in the ECB's monetary policy compared to the United States and United Kingdom, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
