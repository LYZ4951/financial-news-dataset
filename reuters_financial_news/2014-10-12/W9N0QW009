WELLINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices climbed 0.2 percent in September, rising for a second month in a row, while the number of houses sold also increased slightly from the previous month, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Monday.

The REINZ said the market picked up late in September after consumers had been cautious ahead of a Sept. 20 general election, with central bank limits on low deposit home loans and higher interest rates also affecting the market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to keep rates on hold until the first quarter of next year, after raising its cash rate by 100 basis points to 3.5 percent between March and July. It has said the state of the housing market will be a factor in determining when it resumes tightening.  --------------------------------------------------------------- House price index (in pct): MonthPvs month   12 months  NZ total +0.2   +1.1+4.1   Auckland +0.8   +0.4+7.7  Christchurch -1.8   -0.8+7.1   MonthPvs month   Vs yr ago   Houses sold  5,911 5,481   -12 pct  Days to sell   35 3831  ------------------------------------------------------------
