MUMBAI, June 3 (Reuters) - India's benchmark 10-year bond yield briefly rose 5 basis points to 8.70 percent from pre-policy levels after the central bank announced a 50 basis points cut in banks' statutory liquidity ratio starting June 14.

Yields, however, retreated on the back of the dovish policy tone, dealers said. [ID:nI8N0N1010] Yield had ended at 8.66 percent on Monday. The partially convertible rupee <INR=D2> briefly trimmed losses to 59.16 per dollar from 59.20 beforehand.
