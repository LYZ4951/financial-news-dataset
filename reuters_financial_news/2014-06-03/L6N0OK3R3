BERLIN, June 3 (Reuters) - The German Finance Ministry said on Tuesday it was not aware of any plans for the government to take a stake in Alstom <ALSO.P> as part of a possible deal between the French industrial group and its German rival Siemens <SIEGn.DE>.

Bloomberg News reported earlier that the German government was considering using state-owned development bank KfW to buy Alstom shares in a deal with Siemens, which is mulling a bid for the French company. The report, which cited anonymous people familiar with the plans, said Germany's purchase of a stake was contingent on the French government buying an equal stake in Alstom from Bouygues <BOUY.PA>, the French firm which owns a large share of Alstom stock.
