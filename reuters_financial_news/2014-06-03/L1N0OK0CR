NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were a touch lower on Tuesday as traders found few reasons to buy with major indexes at record levels, though the market's recent upward momentum appeared intact.

* Both the Dow and S&P 500 closed at records on Monday; that was the benchmark S&P's third consecutive record. However, recent gains have come in light trading, indicating the rally has lacked conviction. About 60,000 S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> contracts changed hands in morning trading on Tuesday, suggesting another day of light action.  * The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX> has also been lower than average, hovering near levels not seen since March 2013. While the current levels of the VIX indicates a lack of fear in the market, some investors are concerned it also reflects a sense of complacency among investors. * Trading catalysts could come later in the session, with the release of data on durable goods and factory orders, both for April and scheduled for release at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT). Factory orders are seen rising 0.5 percent in the month, a smaller advance than in March. The Institute for Supply Management's May read on New York economic activity is also on tap, due at 9:45 a.m. * S&P 500 futures <SPc1> fell 3 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> slid 2 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> lost 6.5 points. * Pilgrim's Pride Corp <PPC.O> confirmed a revised proposal to buy Hillshire Brands <HSH.N> for $55 a share, an offer that values the company at $7.7 billion. Last week, Tyson Foods Inc <TSN.N> offered to buy Hillshire for $6.3 billion. Hillshire said it would conduct talks with both parties. Its stock rose 8.4 percent to $58.05 before the bell. [ID:nASA097MV] * Element Financial Corp <EFN.TO> late Monday agreed to buy PHH Corp's <PHH.N> auto fleet leasing business for about $1.4 billion in cash. [ID:nL1N0OJ0T1] * Gladstone Commercial Corp <GOOD.O> was one of the premarket session's most active Nasdaq names, falling 3 percent to $17 after the company announced a common stock offering of an undisclosed size. Spherix Inc <SPEX.O> rose 17 percent to $2.11 in heavy trading after the company announced $20 million in equity financing.For Market Pulse:  [WATCH/US]  For running updates on what's moving U.S. stocks: [STXNEWS/US] ==============================================================  For other U.S. market data and news:   U.S. Equities speed guide........................<US/EQUITY>   S&P 500 index ........................................<.SPX>   Dow Jones industrial average..........................<.DJI>   Nasdaq Composite index...............................<.IXIC>   Nasdaq 100............................................<.NDX>   Thomson Reuters US Index .......................<.TRXFLDUSP>  Russell 2000 small cap................................<.RUT>   S&P major sectors..............................<0#.GSPMAJOR>   NYSE most active.....................................<.AV.N>   Nasdaq most active...................................<.AV.O>   Top NYSE pct gainers.................................<.PG.N>   Top NYSE pct losers..................................<.PL.N>   Top Nasdaq pct gainers...............................<.PG.O>   Top Nasdaq pct losers................................<.PL.O>   52 week highs:  NYSE...............<t.YH.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YH.O>   52 week lows:  NYSE...............<t.YL.N>  Nasdaq..............<t.YL.O>Main global stock indexes and market reports:   FTSE Eurotop 300 .....<.FTEU3>  European report .......[.EU]   Nikkei 225.............<.N225>  Tokyo report............[.T]   FTSE 100...............<.FTSE>  London report...........[.L]   Xetra DAX.............<.GDAXI>  Frankfurt market stories[.F]   CAC-40.................<.FCHI>  Paris market stories...[.PA]   World Indices.....................................<0#.INDEX>   Reuters survey of world bourse outlook.........<EQUITYPOLL1>   U.S. IPO diary........................................[IPO/]   U.S. Asset Allocation Table.......................[US/ASSET] More Reuters News on equities at a glance:   Equities ............[E]   US company news.........[TOP/EQU]Key non-equities market reports:   Foreign exchange......................................[FRX/]   Oil....................................................[O/R]   US Treasuries.........................................[US/N]   International bonds...................................[EUB/]   Gold.......................................[GOL/X] or [GOL/]   ))  Keywords: MARKETS USA STOCKS/
