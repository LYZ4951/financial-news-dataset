MEXICO CITY, June 3 (Reuters) - Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Prologis Inc. said its Mexican unit aims to raise up to nearly 7 billion pesos ($538 million) on Wednesday, in what would be Mexico's first initial public offering (IPO) this year.

Fibra Prologis, the Mexican affiliate of U.S. REIT Prologis Inc. <PLD.N>, will sell up to 258 million shares for 27 pesos per share, the company said in a statement. The trusts, known locally as fibras, issue certificates that function much like shares and allow investors to participate in Mexico's property market without owning buildings. Mexico saw a record level of IPOs in 2013, but momentum did not carry over into the new year because emerging markets worldwide were hit by sell-offs.
