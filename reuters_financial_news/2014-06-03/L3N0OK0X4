BANGKOK, June 3 (Reuters) - Shares in Thai industrial land developers Amata Corp  <AMATA.BK> and Hemaraj Land Development PCL <HEMRAJ.BK>, rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday on expectations the companies would benefit from the approval of new investment projects by Thailand's military government.

Thailand's military government expects that backlogged applications from local and foreign investors to invest more than $21 billion will be acted on within two months, the junta's head of economic matters said on Monday. [ID:nL3N0OJ1PI]
