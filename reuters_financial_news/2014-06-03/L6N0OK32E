BERNE, June 3 (Reuters) - A Swiss official on Tuesday played down the threat of wealthy foreigners switching funds from Switzerland to rival money haven Singapore, saying both are moving to share data despite banking secrecy.

A survey last year predicted Singapore would dethrone Switzerland by 2015 as the world's top centre for managing international funds, as a global tax crackdown and tighter regulation weaken the Alpine nation's appeal to investors.

"You hear arguments that money will go to other places like Singapore," Stefan Flueckiger said at a conference in Berne on Swiss banking.  "But Singapore is also in the Global Forum and in principle is adopting the same reforms and undergoing the same peer reviews," he said, referring to the OECD group seeking to ensure countries enforce global standards on transparency and cooperation. "All countries are being treated exactly the same and that makes me optimistic for the future," he added. Singapore and Switzerland, both members of the OECD group, have joined the growing ranks of countries agreeing to share tax information automatically. For Switzerland, this means breaking with centuries-old secrecy laws.
