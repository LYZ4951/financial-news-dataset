PARIS, June 3 (Reuters) - France's foreign minister said on Tuesday his country would defend the interests of French bank BNP Paribas <BNP>PA> after it faced the prospect of a $10 billion-plus fine from the United States and called the penalty "unreasonable."

"The fine has to be proportionate and reasonable," Laurent Fabius said on France 2 television. "These figures are not reasonable." Fabius said the United States should deal with the issue as partner and not unilaterally.
