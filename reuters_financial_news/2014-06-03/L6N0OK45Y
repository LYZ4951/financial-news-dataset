LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Part-Nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> has followed rival Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> in placing restrictions on mortgage lending to tackle rising house prices, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The bank, which is 81 percent owned by the government, will introduce a four times loan-to-income cap and maximum term of 30 years for all mortgages worth 500,000 pounds ($837,000) or more.
