MUMBAI, June 3 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Tuesday to a record closing high as metal stocks such as Tata Steel <TISC.NS> surged after surveys showed China's factory and services sectors had their best performance in months, while the central bank held rates steady and toned down its inflation rhetoric.
