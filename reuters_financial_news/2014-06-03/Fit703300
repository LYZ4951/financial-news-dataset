June 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Banco Bilbao Vizcaya  Argentaria S.A., Taipei Branch's (BBVA Taipei) National Long-Term Rating to  'AA(twn)' from 'AA-(twn)' and simultaneously affirmed its National Short-Term  Rating at 'F1+(twn)'. The Outlook is Stable.  The rating action follows Fitch's upgrade of its head office, Banco Bilbao  Vizcaya Argentaria's <BBVA.MC> (BBVA) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating to 'A-' from 'BBB+'  (see 'Fitch Upgrades Santander and BBVA to 'A-'; Stable Outlook' dated 29 May  2014 at www.fitchratings.com).  KEY RATING DRIVERS - National Ratings BBVA Taipei's ratings and Outlook remain tied to BBVA's, reflecting its legal  status as a branch and part of BBVA, as well as the highly integrated nature of  their operations. Under Taiwanese regulations, the head office has a legal  obligation to support any liquidity needs that a branch is not able to cover on  its own as well as to meet the regulatory minimum capital requirement.
