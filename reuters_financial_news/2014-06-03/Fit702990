June 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned HSH Finanzfonds  AoeR's [HSHND.UL] EUR500m floating rate bonds, due 17 June 2019, an expected Long-term  rating of 'AAA(EXP)'. The two German federated States of Hamburg  (AAA/Stable/F1+) and Schleswig-Holstein (AAA/Stable/F1+) have explicitly and  irrevocably guaranteed the issue. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The expected rating reflects the explicit and irrevocably guarantee from Hamburg  and Schleswig-Holstein. Their 'AAA' ratings are based on the strong support  mechanisms that apply to all members of the German Federation, and the extensive  liquidity facilities they benefit from, which ensure timely debt and debt  service payment.  The support mechanism applies uniformly to all members of the German Federation:  the Federal Republic of Germany (AAA/Stable) represented by the federal  government (Bund) and the 16 federated states, which includes the two states  guaranteeing this issue. All Laender are equally entitled to financial support  in the event of financial distress irrespective of differences in economic and  financial performances. Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein have founded the public law institution (Anstalt  oeffentlichen Rechts; AoeR) HSH Finanzfonds AoeR for the purpose of supporting  HSH Nordbank AG [HSH.UL] (HSH; A-/F1) with capital from its owners, enabling it to fulfil  its incumbent equity requirements in 2009. HSH issued two bonds in in the  foundation year and a large part of the redemption payments is ensured by  commission revenues stemming from the guarantee. The remainder will be  refinanced by this third issue. Based on its legal status, HSH Finanzfonds AoeR benefits from a deficiency  guarantee (Gewaehrtragerhaftung) and a maintenance obligation (Anstaltslast)  from both states. Furthermore, both states have granted an explicit and  irrevocable, unsubordinated guarantee on first demand of all its outstanding  obligations with each state guaranteeing 50%. This means that HSH Finanzfonds  AoeR's debt ranks equally with all the guarantors' other unsubordinated and  unsecured liabilities. Both guarantors are equally and severally, but not  jointly, liable. The law creating HSH Finanzfonds AoeR, which is located in Hamburg, became  effective on 14 April 2009. Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein are the bearers of  the AoeR and each holds 50% of its equity. The Deutsche Bundesbank Hamburg will act as the paying agent. The liquidity of  the issue is underpinned by the safe cash management system operated by the  states (overnight cash exchanges between the states and the Bund when necessary  and recourse to appropriate short-term credit lines). The issue is zero  risk-weighted and is European Central Bank repo-eligible.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade of the sovereign ratings could lead to a downgrade of the Laender  and consequently the bond's rating. An adverse change of an important  institutional feature (solidarity principle, equalisation system, liquidity  exchange mechanism) would result in a review of the German Laender ratings. Any  change on the legal status of the issuer or the existing guarantee scheme will  also require a review of the bond rating. A pre-sale report is available at www.fitchratings.com.
