LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Europe's markets watchdog has issued a notice censuring ratings agency Standard & Poor's for internal control failings related to it erroneously announcing in 2011 it was downgrading France's debt.

In a statement on Tuesday, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said the incident, involving an email sent out to subscribers stating "France (Republic of) (Unsolicited Ratings): DOWNGRADE", when S&P's rating of France had not been downgraded, breached regulations.
