June 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned FirstRand Bank Limited's [FSRJHB.UL] (FRB) proposed ZAR-denominated Basel III-compliant Tier 2 subordinated notes an  expected Long-term rating of 'BBB-(EXP)' and an expected National Long-term  rating of 'AA-(zaf)(EXP)'. The notes will be issued under the bank's ZAR80bn  domestic medium-term note (DMTN) programme.  The final ratings are subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming  to information already received.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The Basel III-compliant Tier 2 securities are rated one notch below FRB's 'bbb'  Viability Rating (VR) to reflect their higher loss-severity risk relative to  senior unsecured debt due to their subordinated status.  The notes qualify as regulatory Tier 2 regulatory capital under Basel III, which  was introduced in South Africa on 1 January 2013. The notes contain contractual  loss absorption features which will be triggered at the point of non-viability  of the bank. These features will be replaced by a statutory loss absorption  regime when it is implemented in South Africa. According to the terms, the notes  can be written off upon the occurrence of a trigger event at the option of the  South African regulator. The notes rank subordinated to senior unsecured  instruments. No additional notching has been ascribed for non-performance risk, which Fitch  regards as minimal relative to the VR assigned. The notes will not qualify for  equity credit under Fitch's criteria.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A change in FRB's VR will have an impact on the securities' rating.  FRB's other ratings are as follows:  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating 'BBB'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Issuer Default Rating 'F3' National Long-Term Rating: 'AA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating: 'F1+(zaf)' Viability Rating 'bbb' Support Rating '3'
