June 3 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service said Illinois could face a structural deficit as the U.S. state failed to extend income tax rates that ended on Dec. 31.

Moody's said the failure to extend the tax rates would reduce the state's revenue by an estimated $1.8 billion in the year starting July 1.
