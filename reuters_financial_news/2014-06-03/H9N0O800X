HONG KONG, June 3 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares reached their highest close in five months, lifted by Chinese manufacturing surveys which reinforced hopes that China's economy may be improving after a few rough months.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> gained 0.9 percent at 23,291.04 points, its highest close since Jan. 2. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 1.2 percent.

That was higher than an expected 50.6, while the HSBC/Markit final PMI reading was 49.4, its best performance in four months but lower than the flash 49.7 reading.
