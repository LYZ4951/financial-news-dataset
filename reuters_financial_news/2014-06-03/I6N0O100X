MILAN, June 3 (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Credito Valtellinese <PCVI.MI> expects consolidation in the Italian banking sector after a health check of European lenders this year and could consider joining in, its CEO Miro Fiordi said on Tuesday.

However, there are no M&A plans on the table at the moment, he said.  "As of today there is nothing, either with (Banca Popolare di) Sondrio <BPSI.MI> or with other banks," Fiordi said, responding to press reports about a possible tie-up with Popolare di Sondrio.  "There can be a period of possible consolidation (after the EU health check) between banks that are similar and healthy, and if there are opportunities we are ready to assess them," he said.
