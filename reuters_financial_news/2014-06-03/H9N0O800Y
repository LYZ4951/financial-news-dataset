HONG KONG, June 3 (Reuters) - China shares ended weaker on Tuesday, with Yili, one of the country's biggest milk powder makers, extending losses and being the biggest drag for both indexes.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> finished flat at 2,038.31 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings inched down 0.3 percent. Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group <600887.SS> tumbled 7.8 percent, closing at its lowest since June 28, 2013. A China Business News report said four subsidiaries of Yili failed to make the latest list of qualified infant formula producers. Bright Dairy & Food <600597.SS> shed 3.8 percent, also a top CSI300 percentage loser. Chinese banks were stronger bolstered by further monetary easing measures.
