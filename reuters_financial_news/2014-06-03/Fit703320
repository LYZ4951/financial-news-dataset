June 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The clean-up of bad debt at Kazakhstan's banks is still  uncertain despite the central bank's latest plans to tackle the high levels of  non-performing loans, Fitch Ratings says. Nevertheless, real asset quality  improvement could be moderately positive for banks' ratings, if they do not  incur large additional losses in transferring the loans to the central bank's  problem loan fund (PLF) or writing them off.   The extent to which the PLF can provide relief for banks is unclear, despite the  proposed recapitalisation to KZT250bn (USD1.4bn) from KZT5bn and changes in  investment policy to allow it to buy construction-related debt - the bulk of the  sector's non-perfoming loans (NPLs). The planned changes could give the fund,  which has struggled to gain traction since being established in early 2012  because of the lack of funding and restrictive investment policy, greater  capacity to buy up banks' bad debt portfolios. But even with the significant increase in size, the PLF is still small compared  with banks' NPLs. Around one-third of Kazakh bank loan books were non-performing  at end-1Q14, according to the central bank. Although reserves on NPLs are  already substantial, we estimate that the five most affected banks would need to  transfer KZT841bn of net NPLs to achieve the 10% NPL target planned by the  central bank for end-2015 (see the attached file for more details).  This is over three times the planned size of the PLF, so the fund can only  partly alleviate banks' asset quality problems. It is unclear whether the  government would increase PLF's size later on with further capital injections,  or allow it to issue public debt, potentially with a state guarantee.  Our estimate excludes KZT466bn of gross NPLs (reserve amounts are not available)  of Alliance Bank ('Restricted Default') and Temirbank <TEBN.KZ> (unrated) because these  banks may significantly increase provisioning levels as a result of Alliance's  ongoing debt restructuring and potential future merger of the two banks. Other  Kazakh banks with NPL ratios above 10% are either small or hold mostly  non-performing consumer finance portfolios that might not be eligible for  purchases by the PLF. The benefit to banks off-loading loans to the PLF will depend on the transfer  mechanism, particularly pricing. Large Kazakh banks' ability to absorb further  loan loss provisions and write-downs is limited relative to the high share of  restructured loans that may require additional reserves. Their profit generation  and capital ratios may be weakened if material losses arise when NPLs are  transferred. The due diligence process could be lengthy and delay any swift  transfer of bad debt. The impact of the latest regulatory NPL cap on Kazakh banks' credit profiles  will depend on the extent to which banks genuinely reduce asset quality risk.  The measure is applied to the unconsolidated balance sheet, which means that  banks could transfer NPLs to subsidiary special-purpose vehicles to meet the 10%  target. We would view this as cosmetic since banks would still retain the risk.  Banks may also lower reported NPLs by writing off loans, but this is likely to  crystallise losses and undermine already weak capital ratios. The authorities are getting tougher with tackling NPLs with the lowering of the  bank NPL limit at end-2015 from the 15% level set in February and imposition of  sanctions, including more limited access to government funding, removal of  management and potentially as severe as licence withdrawals, on banks that don't  comply. However, it remains unclear how strictly the new NPL limits will be  enforced given the challenges the bank might have with meeting them and the  forbearance shown so far.
