June 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed APETRA's  Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'AA' and  its Short-term foreign currency IDR at 'F1+'. The Outlook is Stable. Its senior  unsecured notes have also been affirmed at 'AA'. Fitch classifies APETRA as a dependent public sector entity (PSE) under its  rating of public sector entities criteria, due to the consolidation of its debt  into general government accounts, strong oversight from the government and its  strategic role in government policy through ensuring the security of oil  supplies for Belgium. As a result the ratings and Outlook of APETRA are  equalised with Belgium's ratings (AA/Stable/F1+).   KEY RATING DRIVERS As a wholly owned entity by the State, in case of dissolution the assets and  liabilities of APETRA would be transferred to the State or another public  entity. Although APETRA is financially autonomous, dividend distributions to its  sole shareholder, the Belgian State, are not possible because of its public  service role. All net profits are incorporated into APETRA's reserves.  The European Directive 2009/119/EC requires each member state to hold strategic  oil stocks to cope with the risk of supply disruptions. APETRA is the exclusive  manager of this obligation for Belgium. In 2013, as requested by Eurostat,  APETRA - as with some state-owned enterprises - have been consolidated into the  general government accounts. Fitch assumes that the Belgium State is highly  motivated to provide support, in case of need, to APETRA and that it has the  legal and financial means to enable APETRA to meet debt-service obligations on a  timely basis. Given APETRA's public service role, the Belgium State exerts strong  administrative, legal and financial oversight over the company. Following its  consolidation into general government accounts, this supervision has been  reinforced through the State's approval of APETRA's annual budget in addition of  the multi-year plan. On a quarterly basis, APETRA presents to the State its debt  levels and the value of its stocks. In 2013, due to a correction of the calculation method, APETRA's required oil  stocks have diminished in absolute value, leaving it with stocks surplus to  requirements. This would allow it to sell some purchase rights of finished  petroleum products at market prices (tickets) in the medium term. Fitch  estimates that cash flow should stabilise at around EUR100m in the medium term.  At end-2013, debt reached EUR1.7bn and represented 15.4 years of cash generated  by APETRA. APETRA plans to repay some of its debt using its strong available  cash resources (EUR200m at end-2013) and net cash flow generation over the  medium term. Despite some exit fees, Fitch estimates that repayment would  improve the debt's profile of APETRA with  debt of EUR860m by end-2019. APETRA's levy is collected on a monthly basis, and is linked to the sales of  each oil company and distributor in Belgium, resulting in stable cash inflows.  Such collections are enforced through state control. Indexed to oil prices,  Fitch estimates that the calculation of the contribution allows for a reduction  in the price risk associated with the purchase and renewal of stock.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A downgrade could follow a similar rating action on the sovereign, an adverse  change in the legal framework - which Fitch considers unlikely at present - and  a weakening of expected support from the State.
