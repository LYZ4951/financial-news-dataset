LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - British interdealer broker Tullet Prebon Plc <TLPR.L> said its chief executive Terry Smith would leave the company once a successor had been appointed.

Issuing a statement on Tuesday in response to media speculation, the FTSE 250 company said it was in the middle of a succession planning process which was "well advanced". "Further announcements will be made when appropriate," Tullet Prebon said.  Smith is a prominent figure in London's financial circles. A source told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that the executive could leave as early as the end of June. [ID:nL6N0OK3DD]
