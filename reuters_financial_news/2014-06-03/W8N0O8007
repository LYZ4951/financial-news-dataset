WARSAW, June 3 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank governor Marek Belka said on Tuesday the bank has the option of intervening in the foreign currency market if it believes the zloty is too volatile.

The Polish zloty gained more than one percent versus euro in the last two weeks on speculation that the European Central Bank may cut rates, increasing the credit cost disparity between Poland and euro zone.
