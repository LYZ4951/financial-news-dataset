June 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that second-tier foreign-owned Turkish banks are well positioned to face the challenges inherent in Turkey's volatile operating environment.  The combined assets of Finansbank A.S. <FINBN.IS>, Turk Ekonomi Bankasi A.S. <TEBNK.IS> (TEB), Denizbank A.S. <DENIZ.IS> and ING Bank A.S. [INGIGB.UL] (INGBT), all majority owned by foreign banks, represent around 14% of banking sector assets in Turkey.  The four peers display reasonably sound financial ratios. Franchises differ  across the banks, with Finansbank the largest, controlling a 4.2% deposit share.  Product mix varies, with TEB, Denizbank and INGBT still trying to build up a  stronger retail presence. All banks have grown rapidly, but loan expansion at  Denizbank, under new ownership since 3Q12, has been faster than peers.  Net interest margins (NIM) are higher than the sector average for all four  banks; TEB, whose origins lie in corporate lending, has the lowest NIM and  Finansbank the highest, reflecting a business mix more focused on retail  banking. Finansbank's core capital ratios are the strongest among peers. This is crucial  since its parent National Bank of Greece <NBGr.AT> (NBG) may not be able to inject  additional capital into Finansbank, should this be required. Loss absorption  capacity at Finansbank, TEB and INGBT is adequate at current rating levels but  weak at Denizbank. Regulatory capital ratios are supported by subordinated debt  provided by the four parents. Such amounts are greater at INGBT and Denizbank.   All banks are rated in the 'BBB' range.  Parental support drives the Long-Term  IDRs of Denizbank (whose parent is Sberbank <SBER.MM> of Russia, BBB/Negative/F3), TEB  (BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, A+/Stable/F1) and INGBT (ING N.V., A+/Negative/F1+) but not for  Finansbank (National Bank of Greece S.A., (NBG) B-/Stable/B). NBG has a weak  financial profile and, thus, Finansbank's IDRs are driven by its own financial  strength.
