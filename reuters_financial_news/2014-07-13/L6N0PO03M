DUBAI, July 13 (Reuters) - Stock markets in the region look likely to consolidate further on Sunday as trading volumes remain low and most companies have yet to report their second-quarter results.

Saudi Arabian petrochemical firm Sipchem <3210.SE> may gain after its second-quarter net profit, announced shortly before the opening, came in 39 percent higher than analysts' average estimate. [ID:nL6N0PO03K] But Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi Arabia's largest listed lender, reported an 8 percent drop in second-quarter profit, which was in line with analysts' estimates. [ID:nL6N0PO03N]. Market players expect bourses in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which posted heavy losses in June after strong gains earlier this year, to mostly trade sideways in coming weeks as they look for a new equilibrium. Dubai's bourse <.DFMGI> rose 1.5 percent to 4,575 points in the last session but now faces resistance around 4,600 points, near lows seen in May and early June. Abu Dhabi's index <.ADI>, which edged up 0.6 percent to 4,847 points, has repeatedly pulled back from around 4,900 points in the last four weeks. Trading volumes fell across the region last week as many retail investors pulled out of the market for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and analysts say activity is unlikely to increase until second-quarter earnings come out; most of them are expected by late July or early August.
