WELLINGTON, July 14  (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices fell for a second month in a row in June, while the number of houses sold dropped sharply, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Monday.

The REINZ said the market was being increasingly dominated by activity in the two largest cities, Auckland and Christchurch. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has said the state of the housing market will be a key factor when it sets interest rates, which are expected to rise by a further 25 basis points to 3.50 percent on July 24.  The bank has also said limits on low deposit home loans by banks, which have been cited as reason for the market's slowdown, will stay in place at least until towards the end of the year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------House price index (in pct): MonthPvs month   12 months  NZ total -0.3   -1.2+6.2   Auckland +1.6   -3.1+6.5  Christchurch -1.9   -2.3+5.5  MonthPvs month   Vs yr ago   Houses sold  5,763 6,572   -6.1 pct  Days to sell3938 34  ------------------------------------------------------------
