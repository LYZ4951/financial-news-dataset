DUBAI, July 13 (Reuters) - Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, Saudi Arabia's largest listed lender, posted a 8.2 percent decrease in its second-quarter net profit, it said in a bourse statement on Sunday, in line with analyst forecasts.

The bank said it made 1.95 billion riyals ($520 million) in the three months ending June 30, compared with 2.12 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expected the bank to post an average net profit of 1.97 billion riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0PI1ED] The decrease was the third straight drop in quarterly profit posted by the bank, which it attributed to a rise in operating expenses without elaborating.   Saudi companies issue brief earnings statements early in the reporting period before publishing more detailed results later.
