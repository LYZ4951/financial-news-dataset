MILAN, July 13 (Reuters) - Italy does not need help in managing its economy from the European Commission, European Central Bank or International Monetary Fund, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said in an interview published on Sunday.

Renzi, interviewed in newspaper Corriere della Sera, was  asked whether Italy could be put under an international aid programme and be supervised by the so-called troika - a joint committee made up of officials from the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF. Renzi said: "never." The prime minister, who took office last February, said that Italy was stronger than it was perceived from abroad. He also said he did not fear that international investors would have a change of heart on Italy. Renzi said he was more worried about internal opposition to his six-month old government than the possibility of a change in foreign investors' sentiment about Italy. "I do not live in fear of the markets. Italy is stronger than the worries of observers," he said. "The real problem is that (economic) recovery in Europe is very fragile ... more than expected," Renzi told the paper, adding industrial output was falling in Italy and Germany. Italian industrial output dropped 1.2 percent month-on-month in May, posting its steepest monthly fall since Nov. 2012, data showed on Thursday.
