HONG KONG, June 17 (Reuters) - China shares fell on Tuesday after data showed the amount of new foreign direct investment (FDI) that China attracted in May shrank by the most in 16 months. [ID:nL4N0OX2KE]

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> slid 0.9 percent at 2,066.70 points, while the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 1.0 percent. It was the biggest one-day loss for both indexes since May 19. The financial sector was broadly weaker with banks being the biggest index drags. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS> shed 1.3 percent and smaller Industrial Bank <601166.SS> slumped 1.5 percent. Brokerages also underperformed, with the two biggest listed players Citic Securities <600030.SS> and Haitong Securities <600837.SS> down 0.9 and 0.7 percent, respectively. Mainland media said securities firms are becoming targets for China's anti-corruption watchdog.
