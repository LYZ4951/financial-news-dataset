LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - Food outlet operator SSP plans to raise around 500 million pounds ($840 million) when it floats on the London stock market, paving the way for Chief Executive Kate Swann to return to a FTSE listed company.

SSP, which owns brands including Caffe Ritazza and Whistlestop, said it expected to raise the funds through the offer of new shares. It will also refinance its existing debt and use the proceeds to pay down debt.
