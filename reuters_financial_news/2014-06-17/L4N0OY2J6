HONG KONG, June 17 (Reuters) - Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC <OZM.N> and Chow Tai Fook Nominee Ltd are among a list of 10 new investors who have agreed to buy a combined HK$29.45 billion ($3.8 billion) stake in CITIC Pacific Ltd <0267.HK>, the Chinese state-owned conglomerate said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.

The introduction of new investors would increase CITIC Pacific's free float to 19 percent, the statement added. Earlier this month, CITIC Pacific's minority shareholders approved a landmark deal to acquire $36 billion of assets from its state-owned parent CITIC Group, China's biggest and oldest financial conglomerate. [ID:nL3N0OF2WY] The stock and cash deal had lowered CITIC Pacific's free float below what was required under Hong Kong rules, but the company secured a special exemption. Other investors to buy stakes in CITIC Pacific are Mount Emei Investment, Oceanwide International, Youngor (Hong Kong) Industrial Co Ltd, Baylite Co, East Crimson Holdings, Trendfield, China Export & Credit Insurance Corp and Sinochem Hong Kong.
