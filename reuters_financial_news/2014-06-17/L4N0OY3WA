June 17 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-term foreign currency rating on Argentina to "CCC-" from "CCC+", citing a higher risk of default on the country's foreign currency debt.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an Argentinian appeal aimed at staving off a default, following which, President Christina Fernandez vowed not to pay holdout investors who did not participate in the country's restructuring of its debt several years ago.
