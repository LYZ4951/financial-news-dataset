June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Bank of Communications  Co., Ltd. [BKCOMH.UL] (BOCOM) Hong Kong Branch's Chinese yuan-denominated senior unsecured  notes a Long-Term Rating of 'A'. The notes will be issued on 23 June 2014 in  three tranches, with three-year maturity, five-year maturity and seven-year  maturity. The issue amounts are CNY1bn, CNY0.5bn and CNY0.5bn respectively.  The notes will be issued under BOCOM Hong Kong Branch's USD3bn euro medium-term  note (EMTN) programme, which was rated by Fitch on 14 May 2014. They will be  issued to institutional investors and will be listed in the GreTai Securities  Market. The proceeds from the notes will be used for the branch's overall  working capital and general corporate purposes. The final rating is assigned following the receipt of the final documents  conforming to information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The notes represent direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured  obligations of BOCOM, and are rated in line with BOCOM's Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'A'. The bank's IDR is in turn based on an extremely  high probability of support, if required, from the Chinese government.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
