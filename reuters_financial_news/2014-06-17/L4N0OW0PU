SEOUL, June 17 (Reuters) - Samsung Everland Inc has chosen Daewoo Securities <006800.KS>, Citigroup <C.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Woori Investment & Securities <005940.KS> to advise on its listing, two sources with knowledge of the matter on Tuesday.

Of the four, Daewoo was chosen as lead advisor, one of the sources said. Everland, a key holding firm within the sprawling Samsung Group that some analysts value at around 8 trillion won ($7.86 billion), said earlier this month it would likely complete its  listing by the first quarter of 2015. [ID:nL3N0OJ4BX] The sources, who had direct knowledge of the advisors' presentation processes, were not authorized to speak to media about the matter. The company's listing is seen as a cornerstone amid a flurry of recent asset transfers between Samsung units that analysts say are part of steps to hand over ownership of the group to the son and daughters of 72-year-old Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> Chairman Lee Kun-hee. A Samsung Everland spokesman declined to comment.
