PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - Siemens <SIEGn.DE> Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said there was no reason for the German company and Japanese partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> to discuss improvements to their offer for Alstom's power businesses.

Kaeser told a news conference on Tuesday that their offer to Alstom, which competes with an earlier proposal by General Electric <GE.N>, was already "superior" and that their project was "really comprehensive".
