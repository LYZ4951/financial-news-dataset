STOCKHOLM, June 17 (Reuters) - Swedish home prices rose 0.7 percent in May from April and 9.3 percent from a year earlier, the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) showed on Tuesday.

Prices for apartments rose 0.7 percent compared to the previous month and 12.6 percent compared to the same month last year. Single-family house prices also increased 0.7 percent on the month, but were up 7.7 percent on the year. The HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends. Swedish home prices have nearly tripled over the last 20 years and both the centre-right government and financial regulators have repeatedly voiced concerns about high levels of household debt and the risk of a bubble in the housing market.
