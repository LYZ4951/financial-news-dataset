June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says renewable energy  projects in Spain face a substantial reduction in cash flows, following the  publication of a new remuneration mechanism for renewables, cogeneration and  waste in the Royal Decree last week. However, the agency views the cash-flow  impact as manageable for Fitch-rated integrated utilities with operations in  Spanish renewables. The affected utilities are Iberdrola, S.A. <IBE.MC> (BBB+/Stable); EDP - Energias de  Portugal, S.A. <EDP.LS> (EDP, BBB-/Rating Watch Negative); Enel SpA <ENEI.MI> (BBB+/Stable), and Gas Natural SDG, S.A. <GAS.MC> (BBB+/Stable). Their diversified business profiles and  additional measures taken by the companies, including cuts in operating and  capital expenditure, should help mitigate the impact of the reduced  remuneration. In a report published today Fitch says the reform significantly cuts current  premiums for some existing projects and eliminates subsidies for those old  renewables assets that have already received high premiums in the past, for  instance, wind farms built before 2005. Legal tail risk exists as the new  measures may be contested in courts. The new remuneration mechanism reduces renewables subsidies by EUR1.7bn in 2014  (18% of total renewables subsidies in 2013) and is part of broader regulatory  measures announced in July 2013. These measures have the effect of reducing  regulated earnings through lower revenues on renewables and electricity  distribution assets, and also through lower capacity payments for gas-fired  plants. Along with other measures, the renewables reform demonstrates the  government's commitment to prevent the emergence of a new tariff deficit in  Spain.
