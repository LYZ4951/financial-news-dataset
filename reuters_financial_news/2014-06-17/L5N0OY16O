MOSCOW, June 17 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank on Tuesday announced changes to the parameters of its rouble intervention policy that reaffirm its commitment to moving towards a freely-floating currency.

The bank said that from July 17 it has reduced the intervention threshold for moving the rouble's floating corridor against a dollar-euro basket to $1 billion from $1.5 billion. It has also reduced the amount of daily interventions for reducing rouble volatility inside the corridor by $100 million, and widened the range in the middle of the corridor where it carries out no interventions to 5.1 roubles from 3.1 roubles.
