STOCKHOLM, June 17 (Reuters) - Former Bank of England Governor Mervin King and one-time Federal Reserve and White House adviser Marvin Goodfriend have been appointed by the Swedish parliament to review the past few years of central bank policy in the Nordic country.

The Riksbank has come under pressure for keeping interest rates too high after undershooting its 2 percent inflation target in recent years, criticism that has grown after Sweden dipped into deflation in the early months of this year. Earlier this year, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman labelled the Riksbank's policy "sado-monetarism" and warned that Sweden could face Japan-style deflation if it continued to undershoot the inflation target. [ID:nL6N0NF35B] Part of the debate concerns the fact that Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves and some other executive board members have cited concerns over soaring household lending when setting policy, an area seen by some as outside the remit of the central bank. Central bank veterans King and Goodfriend will examine monetary policy from 2010 to 2014, focusing on whether rates were at appropriate levels and to what extent the bank's policy has achieved its goals, parliament's finance committee said. The evaluation - the parliament's third external review of monetary policy - will be carried out jointly by the two and be finished by the end of 2015, the finance committee said in a statement. The review will also include scrutiny of the Riksbank's decision to factor in household debt as well as the design of the inflation target.
