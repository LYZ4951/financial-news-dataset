SEOUL, June 17 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> weakened against the dollar on Tuesday for the fourth straight session as escalating violence in Iraq took a toll on investors' appetite for riskier assets, but demand from exporters limited the downside.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,021.9 per dollar at the end of onshore trade, down 0.2 percent from Monday's 1,020.1 and the weakest close since June 4. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.4 percent at 2,001.55 points, above the psychologically important 2,000 threshold, as the weaker won sparked a rally in auto shares.
