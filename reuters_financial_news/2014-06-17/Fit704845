June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Netherlands-based NIBC  Bank NV's [NIBCAP.UL] (NIBC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-', Short-term IDR  at 'F3', and Viability Rating (VR) at 'bbb-'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR  is Stable. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this rating  action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The IDRs and VR reflect NIBC's niche banking business model, making its  performance vulnerable to economic cycles. The ratings also reflect NIBC's  current weak profitability, which leaves a limited buffer to absorb unexpected  shocks, although the risk is partly mitigated by the bank's strong  capitalisation.  NIBC's niche franchise, which focuses on lending and other asset financing  products mainly in the Netherlands and increasingly in Germany, results in  revenue and asset concentrations. NIBC's company profile has a high influence on  its ratings, particularly in view of its large exposures to cyclical sectors  such as shipping and commercial real estate. The bank, however, continues to  reduce concentrations in its loan book and diversify its geographical reach,  which in the long-term may decrease the relative influence of NIBC's company  profile on its VR.  Slow economic growth, low transaction volumes, and low interest rates continue  to weigh on NIBC's net interest income-driven profitability. Profitability has  also been affected by elevated loan impairment charges in recent years. Benefits  expected from NIBC's German acquisition will partly be offset by continued low  interest rates (see "Fitch: No Rating Impact on NIBC from German Acquisition"  dated 12 March 2014). Nevertheless Fitch expects the Dutch housing market and  corporate sector to stabilise in 2014 and 2015, which should help the bank's  earnings. Repaying expensive state-guaranteed funding in 2014 and a reduction in  low- yielding assets should further aid profit generation.  NIBC's capitalisation is strong and compares well with that of domestic and  international peers. Its low profitability generates weak internal capital  generation but solid leverage and high risk- weighted capital ratios provide an  adequate buffer against moderate shocks, which is important given the bank's  exposure to certain cyclical industries. NIBC has largely been able to manage  the quality of its loan portfolio through the downturn.  NIBC is reliant on wholesale markets for structural funding, but deposit funding  is growing in importance. NIBC maintains a large buffer of high quality liquid  assets to mitigate refinancing risks resulting from its funding structure.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, VR AND SENIOR DEBT NIBC's ratings are sensitive to an increase of risk appetite of the bank or  materially lower liquidity or capitalisation. Its low profitability means  capital is the key risk buffer and worsening asset quality or lower  capitalisation would therefore likely be rating-negative. The bank's niche profile limits the rating's upside and any positive rating  action would be contingent on a sustained improvement in profitability,  strengthening its ability to absorb unexpected shocks.  KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  NIBC's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect the  agency's view that while support from the Dutch authorities is possible, it  cannot be relied upon. This primarily reflects NIBC's small franchise in the  Dutch market. Similarly, while there is a possibility that its owner, a consortium led by the  private equity firm JC Flowers & Co, may support NIBC in case of need, Fitch is  unable to adequately assess the owner's capacity to support and as a result  potential support from its ultimate shareholders is not factored into NIBC's  Support Rating nor Support Rating Floor. Fitch currently does not envisage any upward pressure on NIBC's Support Rating  or Support Rating Floor.   KEY RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID  SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by NIBC are all notched down  from the bank's VR. Therefore, their respective ratings have been affirmed,  alongside the VR, and are sensitive to any change in the VR.  The ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria 'Assessing and Rating Bank  Subordinated and Hybrid Securities Criteria', reflecting each instrument's  respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles, which vary  considerably. Tier 2 securities are rated one notch below NIBC's VR to reflect the incremental  loss severity risk of these securities relative to average recoveries. Fitch  does not apply additional notching for non-performance risk as it believes it is  not materially different to that reflected by the VR.  Hybrid Tier 1 securities are rated four notches below NIBC's VR to reflect the  higher loss severity risk of these securities relative to average recoveries  (two notches from the VR) and a high risk of non-performance (an additional two  notches).  KEY RATING DRIVER AND SENSITIVITIES - STATE-GUARANTEED DEBT NIBC's state-guaranteed securities are rated 'AAA', reflecting the Dutch  sovereign guarantee and so are sensitive to any change in the Netherlands'  rating (AAA/Negative). The rating actions are as follows:  Long-term IDR: affirmed at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable Short-term IDR: affirmed at 'F3' Viability Rating: affirmed at 'bbb-' Support Rating: affirmed at '5'  Support Rating Floor: affirmed at 'No Floor' State-guaranteed debt: affirmed at 'AAA'/'F1+' Senior unsecured debt: affirmed at 'BBB-' /'F3'  Subordinated debt: affirmed at 'BB+'
