MUMBAI, June 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped two days of falls and ended up on Tuesday, recovering from a 1-1/2-week low hit on Monday, buoyed by gains in upstream oil and gas companies on expectations of margin expansion after a surge in international oil prices.

Brent crude futures held near $113 per barrel on Tuesday as concerns over oil supply persisted, with the United States considering air strikes in Iraq amid a worsening security situation in the key oil producing country. [O/R] Gains were led by oil explorers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS>, Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> and Oil India Ltd <OILI.NS>.  State-run oil marketing companies such Indian Oil Corp <IOC.NS>, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd <HPCL.NS> and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd <BPCL.NS> also rose. The market traded cautiously, amid a volatile trading session, tracking weak regional peers as the deepening conflict in Iraq and a gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia sapped investors' appetite for riskier assets. "We have seen a minor correction, and it's giving an entry point to people who were not part of the earlier rally. Markets are likely to trade range-bound till the budget and we may see some portfolio shuffling," said Suresh Parmar, head of institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets. "It's still a buy-on-dip market and the outlook is positive," he said. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> gained 1.31 percent to 25,521.19, its biggest single-day gain since June 6. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> closed up 1.3 percent at 7,631.70, also marking its biggest single-day gain since June 6. Shares in ONGC closed 4.3 percent higher on the back of increasing global oil prices. Other explorers such as Oil India gained 1 percent, while Reliance Industries closed 2.3 percent higher. Gail (India) Ltd <GAIL.NS> closed 2.7 percent higher. Banking stocks gained, with State Bank of India <SBI.NS> ending 2.8 percent higher and ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> gaining 2.51 percent. The bank index of NSE <.NSEBANK> closed 2.3 percent higher. Among other blue-chip stocks, Larsen and Toubro <LART.NS> rose 2.06 percent after falling 2.1 percent in the previous session. Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd <BHEL.NS> ended 2.8 percent higher. The capital goods index of the BSE <.BSECG> gained 1.93 percent. Shares in export-oriented companies have also gained after the rupee <INR=D2> slumped to a near two-month low earlier in the day. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd <TCS.NS> closed 0.4 percent higher, while HCL Technologies <HCLT.NS> ended up 2.25 percent. However, auto stocks fell. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd <MAHM.NS> ended 1.42 percent lower and Hero MotoCorp <HROM.NS> closed down 0.76 percent. Overseas investors, who were supporting a 21 percent rally in Indian shares so far this year, became net sellers on Monday, selling shares worth 1.94 billion rupees, after three days of buying.
