June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

New Turkish asset management laws due to  take effect 1 July should help boost assets under management while also  encouraging greater competition, Fitch Ratings says.  The new requirements are part of a longer-term initiative from the Capital  Markets Board of Turkey (CMB) to bring the Turkish asset management industry  closer into line with European institutional standards. The law requires the use  of an independent, third-party fund administrator and custodian. It also  promotes open architecture and third-party distribution, through the launch of  Electronic Fund Trading Platform of Turkey, set up by Takasbank.  Together these requirements should help strengthen investor confidence in the  sector and provide easier access to funds, helping inflows. Savings rates in  Turkey are low by international standards and retail investors' appetite for  more advanced products such as managed funds and private pensions is, in Fitch's  opinion, still modest.  The new law follows previous CMB initiatives, including measures to cut  management fees and reform pensions, which contributed to a 30% growth of  pension assets in 2013. Asset managers have a year to comply with the new  regulations. This allows time to review operating models as well as to establish  new business relationships and marketing strategies. At the same time, revenue models are changing, including the introduction of  performance fees. These should increase alignment of interest between asset  manages and their clients, but may also put pressure on certain asset manager's  operating margins at a time when the funding of strategic, IT and regulatory  projects is critical. The law will also create a new umbrella structure for mutual funds, which we  believe will make it easier for managers to launch new funds. It is already  encouraging more competition in an industry that was structurally captive until  recently. The number of asset management companies has increased to 27 from 21  as a result. But the top five managers still represent over 70% of the market.
