June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned UBS SDIC RuiYi Money  Market Fund a 'AAAmmf(chn)' National Money Market Fund Rating. Launched in March  2014, the fund is domiciled in China and managed by UBS SDIC Fund Management  Co., Ltd (UBS SDIC).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The main drivers for the rating are: -- The portfolio's overall credit quality and diversification  -- Short maturity profile with minimal exposure to interest rate and spread  risks -- Strong overnight and one-week liquidity profiles -- The capabilities and resources of UBS SDIC as investment manager   The 'AAAmmf(chn)' National Money Market Fund Rating reflects the fund's strong  capacity to achieve the investment objectives of preserving principal and  providing shareholder liquidity through limiting credit, market and liquidity  risk, relative to all other short-term investments in China.   PORTFOLIO CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION In line with Fitch's 'National Scale Money Market Fund Rating Criteria' and  'AAAmmf(chn)'-rated money market funds, the fund seeks to maintain a high credit  quality by investing exclusively in securities/counterparties with a minimum  international foreign currency rating of 'A-', or of comparable credit quality  rated by other global credit rating agencies. The fund also controls  concentration risk by setting limits on its exposures to individual issuers and  counterparties. Almost all the portfolio is directly or indirectly exposed to the Chinese  sovereign's credit risk. The fund investment universe comprises exchange-traded  or interbank repurchase agreements, and Chinese sovereign bonds and policy bank  bonds with maturities of up to two years. It may also invest in negotiated  callable time deposits with large state-owned commercial banks. To assess the  portfolio's liquidity and average maturities, Fitch considers the final maturity  of such deposits as opposed to their call date. The fund typically avoids  investments in corporate commercial papers. As of early-June 2014, most of the fund's assets were exchange-traded repos,  which typically have a maturity of seven days or less and are collateralised  according to the standards set by the stock exchange. Fitch views such repos as  Chinese sovereign risk. The fund's cash is held at the custodian bank, Bank of  China <601988.SS> (A/Stable/F1).   MATURITY PROFILES The fund's maturity profile is maintained in line with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' national  scale money market fund rating criteria. At early-June, the fund's weighted  average maturity and weighted average life stood well within Fitch's guidelines. The fund also limits the maturity date of any single investment to 397 days  other than policy bank floating-rate notes (FRNs) which may have maturities of  up to 24 months.  LIQUIDITY PROFILES The fund's investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining strong levels of  daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' redemption requests, in line with  Fitch's rating criteria. The liquidity profile of the fund is conservatively  managed, in line with its investor concentration. All of the fund's assets were  maturing within seven days as of early-June 2014. Longer maturities will likely  be introduced as the fund's investor gets more diversified.   FUNDS' OBJECTIVES The objective of the UBS SDIC RuiYi Money Market Fund is to provide capital  stability, liquidity and income through investment in a portfolio of high credit  quality money market instruments and short-term bonds. The fund is benchmarked  against the seven-day net deposit rate.  INVESTMENT MANAGERS UBS SDIC is a Sino-foreign joint venture asset management company, incorporated  in June 2005. SDIC Trust and Investment Co. Ltd, a Chinese state-owned  enterprise, owns 51% and UBS AG the remaining 49%. UBS SDIC is regulated by the  China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  Fitch views UBS SDIC's investment management capabilities, operational controls,  financial and resource commitments and compliance procedures as consistent with  a 'AAAmmf(chn)' National Money Market Fund rating.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or market  risk profile of the fund. A material adverse deviation from Fitch guidelines for  any key rating driver could cause Fitch to downgrade the rating. Volatile  interbank market conditions and tight liquidity as experienced during June and  October 2013 may represent challenges even for the conservative profile of UBS  SDIC RuiYi Money Market Fund relative to the broader MMF universe in China,  particularly when accompanied by redemption pressure. A downgrade of the sovereign's international Long-Term Issuer Default Rating may  not necessarily result in a downgrade of the fund's National Money Market Fund  Rating as it could continue to represent the lowest credit, market and liquidity  risk available in China, in line with Fitch's national scale rating approach.
