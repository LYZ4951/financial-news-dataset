PRAGUE, June 17 (Reuters) - The Czech financial sector is stable could withstand a strong recession accompanied by deflation thanks to capital buffers, the central bank said on Tuesday in a regular financial stability report.

The main risks to the sector were a possible return to recession because of developments in trading partners as well as a deterioration in domestic demand, the central bank said. "(Global) central banks and supervisory authorities are facing the task of avoiding a renewed decline in demand and a fall of economies to the deflation trap, and at the same time preventing excessive risk-taking on financial markets," the central bank (CNB) said. "The CNB is actively preventing the risk of a drop in demand and deflation by using the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument, which is contributing to the stability of the financial system."
