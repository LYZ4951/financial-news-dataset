COPENHAGEN, June 17 (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank governor said on Tuesday he believes the country will be ready to enter the European Banking Union in 2016.

"Denmark should be in the banking union - the banks are tough and have a healthy long-term income," Lars Rohde said at a news conference. The Danish government has said it is in no hurry to decide about participating in Europe's banking union. Minister of Economic Affairs Margrethe Vestager said the government would examine the consequences for the Danish economy before any decision was made [ID:nL6N0O648B]. Rohde said Denmark's five biggest financial institutions, which dominate with an 85 percent market share, would make it through a financial crisis tougher than the last one and would not require any capital injections. "It is essential to have a financial sector that functions like any other company, where you do not see that shareholders and management take profits in the good times, and leave losses with the taxpayers in bad times," Rohde said.
