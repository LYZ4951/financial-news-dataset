BUENOS AIRES, June 16 (Reuters) - President Cristina Fernandez said on Monday that Argentina would  honor its payments to holders of its restructured debt and so avoid a default despite suffering a setback in its long-running legal battle against "holdout" investors.

The U.S. Supreme Court earlier on Monday declined to hear Argentina's appeal over its battle with hedge funds that refused to take part in its debt restructurings. The court's decision was unexpected and risks toppling Latin America's No 3 economy into a new default.
