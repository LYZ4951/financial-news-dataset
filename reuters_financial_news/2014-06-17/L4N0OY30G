HONG KONG, June 17 (Reuters) - Property-to-jewellery conglomerate Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, controlled by the family of tycoon Cheng Yu-tung, has bid for Standard Chartered's <STAN.L> Hong Kong consumer finance unit PrimeCredit, a director of the privately owned company said on Tuesday.

"It is still in the bidding process," Henry Cheng, a director of the conglomerate and chairman of Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group <1929.HK> told reporters. "It is an investment of the private company and is not related to the listed firm. It will not affect the financial strength of Chow Tai Fook Jewellery," Cheng said. He made no further comment. Japan's Shinsei Bank Ltd <8303.T> and Carlyle Group <CG.O> are among suitors who have advanced to a final round of bidding for PrimeCredit, people familiar with the matter said last month.
