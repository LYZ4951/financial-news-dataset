BUENOS AIRES, June 17 (Reuters) - Argentina's Economy Minister Axel Kicillof said on Tuesday the  government is eyeing steps to restructure debt held by exchange bondholders to place it under Argentine law. [ID:nL2N0OY1ZM]

Kicillof said that if Argentina were to obey a U.S. ruling ordering it to pay $1.33 billion to holdout hedge funds, it would be pushed into a new default because it would open the door to claims worth $15 billion from other holdout bondholders. Still, the minister also said he was sending lawyers to the United States to converse with U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, in a sign some interpreted as openness to negotiations. Analysts made the following comments:  IGNACIO LABAQUI, ANALYST FOR CONSULTANCY MEDLEY GLOBAL: "Essentially he's saying Argentina is going to ignore the ruling. This is a fairly risky move ... Still, they haven't closed the door to negotiations. They're playing the 'carrot and the stick' approach. The problem is that Argentina doesn't have negotiation power at the moment." "With every step, the margin to avoid a technical default is getting smaller."   MIGUEL KIGUEL, ECONOMIST AND FORMER FINANCE SECRETARY "It's not a default yet, but it could become one because Griesa could consider they're seeking to avoid the ruling. If that's the case, Griesa could lift the stay and then Argentina wouldn't be able to pay and would fall into default." "Market reaction will be negative. It would have been positive, had they said they were going to negotiate with Griesa, but by speaking of a local swap, they muddied things."   JOSE LUIS ESPERT, ESPERT CONSULTANCY: "Changing the governing law in and of itself is a default."   SIOBHAN MORDEN, HEAD OF LATIN AMERICA STRATEGY AT JEFFERIES IN NEW YORK: "I think everybody has to be honest and admit it is not just $1.5 billion. There is a risk of much greater liabilities, and it is true that hard-core litigant holdouts are typically less flexible because that's their job."
