MILAN, June 17 (Reuters) - Two Latin American investors and the Monte dei Paschi foundation have lent almost all their respective stakes in the Tuscan bank to third parties until July 3, according to a filing published by Italian market regulator Consob on Tuesday.

Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> is in the second week of a highly dilutive 5-billion euro rights issue with a drastic shortage of new shares disrupting trading.
