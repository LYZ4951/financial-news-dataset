MUMBAI, June 17 (Reuters) - Indian shares gained on Tuesday, snapping two days of falls and recovering from a 1-1/2 week low hit in the previous session, helped by gains in upstream oil and gas companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS> and Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> on expectation of margin expansion after a surge in international oil prices.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally gained 1.31 percent to 25,521.19, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 1.3 percent higher at 7,631.70.
