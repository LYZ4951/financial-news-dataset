June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Arbour CLO Limited notes  final ratings, as follows:  EUR208.75m class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR26.25m class B-1: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable  EUR19.95m class B-2: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable  EUR11.25m class C-1: 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR10.75m class C-2: 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR19.75m class D: 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR26.675m class E: 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR12.125m class F: 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable EUR39.5m subordinated notes: not rated  Arbour CLO Limited is an arbitrage cash flow collateralised loan obligation  (CLO).   KEY RATING DRIVERS 'B' Category Portfolio Credit Quality The average credit quality of the indicative portfolio is in the 'B' category.  The agency has public ratings or credit opinions on all obligors in the  indicative portfolio. The covenanted maximum Fitch weighted average rating  factor (WARF) for assigning the final ratings is 34.0. The WARF of the  indicative portfolio is 31.6.  High Expected Recoveries At least 90% of the portfolio comprises senior secured obligations. Fitch has  assigned Recovery Ratings (RR) to all assets in the indicative portfolio. The  covenanted minimum Fitch weighted average recovery rate (WARR) for assigning the  final ratings is 69%. The WARR of the indicative portfolio is 74.8%.  Payment Frequency Switch The notes pay quarterly, while the portfolio assets can reset to a semi-annual  basis. The transaction has an interest smoothing account, but no liquidity  facility. Potential liquidity stress for the non-deferrable class A, B-1 and B-2  notes - stemming from a large proportion of assets resetting to a semi-annual  basis in any one quarterly period - is addressed by switching the payment  frequency on the notes to semi-annual in such a scenario.  Partial Interest Rate Hedge Between 5% and 15% of the portfolio may be invested in fixed-rate assets, while  fixed-rate liabilities account for 10% of total liabilities.  Limited FX Risk The transaction is allowed to invest up to 50% of the portfolio in  non-euro-denominated assets, provided these are hedged with perfect asset swaps  within six months of purchase. Unhedged non-euro assets must not exceed 2.5% of  the portfolio at any time.   Trading Gain Release The portfolio manager may designate trading gains as interest proceeds,  providing the portfolio balance remains above the reinvestment target par  balance and the class E overcollateralisation (OC) test remains above its value  at the effective date.  TRANSACTION SUMMARY Net proceeds from the issue of the notes are being used to purchase a EUR365.3m  portfolio of mostly European leveraged loans and bonds. The portfolio is managed  by Oaktree Capital Management (UK) LLP. The reinvestment period is scheduled to  end in July 2018. The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or noteholder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a rating action  commentary if the change has a negative impact on the ratings. Such amendments  may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis confirms the  expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity.  If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from a rating  perspective Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that  confirmation is considered to be given if Fitch declines to comment.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A 25% increase in the expected obligor default probability would lead to a  downgrade of up to three notches for the rated notes.  A 25% reduction in expected recovery rates would lead to a downgrade of up to  six notches for the rated notes.
