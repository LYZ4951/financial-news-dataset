June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned SriLankan Airlines  Limited's (SLA) proposed issue of US dollar denominated government guaranteed  bonds an expected rating of 'BB-(EXP)'. The proceeds of the issuance are likely to be used to acquire aircraft and as  working capital.  The final rating is contingent upon receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The bonds are rated at the same level at SLA's parent, the government of Sri  Lanka (BB-/Stable), due to the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee provided  by the government. The Sri Lankan government holds 92% of SLA directly and 7%  indirectly through state-owned entities.  Sri Lanka's sovereign rating is mainly driven by the country's strengths in  terms of a strong growth performance, high level of human development, and a  strong payment record, against the weaknesses in both its fiscal and external  balance sheets. Sri Lanka has substantial twin deficits and the government debt  burden remains relatively high. SLA is the national airline of Sri Lanka and has a 54% market share of  travellers to and from the island both in terms of flight departures and  available seat kilometres. Passenger numbers have increased to 4.3m in 2013 from  2.6m in 2010. As the leading airline, the company is well-positioned to capture  the benefits of the government's policy to promote and develop tourism to the  island.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may lead to negative rating action include:  - A downgrade of Sri Lanka's sovereign ratings.  Positive: Future developments that may lead to positive rating action include:
