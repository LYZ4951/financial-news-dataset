June 17 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings believes the operational performance of  leading mall operators (BR Malls, Multiplan, Iguatemi, General Shopping Brasil,  Aliansce and Sonae Sierra Brasil) should remain stable despite weak economic  growth, increasing domestic inflation and deceleration of retail consumption.  The structure of the leases and the shortage of high quality malls continues to  give operators a strong position. This should enable them to have high EBITDA  margins and strong cash flow generation in 2014.   The sector's leading companies have healthy levels of occupancy rates at 97%.  Late payments are also manageable at only 2%. Same store sales (SSS) and same  store rents (SSR) have slowed toward the end of 2013 and in the first-quarter  2014 vis-a-vis 2011-2012 but remains at adequate levels of 8%-9%. Fitch expects  to see some retraction in SSS and SSR during the World-Cup soccer event, but it  should not have a material impact upon 2014 results.  The sector's gross leasable area (GLA) has increased at a compound annual growth  rate (CAGR) of 8.5% during the last five years ending Dec. 31, 2013, and the  number of shopping malls increased to 495 in 2013 from 392 in 2009. During the  next two years, growth should moderate due to less greenfields and a more  cautious approach to investments during a period of slow economic growth.
