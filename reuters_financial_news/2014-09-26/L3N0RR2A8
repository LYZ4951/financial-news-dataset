SEOUL, Sept 26 (Reuters) - South Korean shares closed slightly lower on Friday, paring losses after hitting a fresh 2-month intraday low early in the session, as bargain hunters locked in on recently laggard underperformers.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.1 percent at 2,031.64 points. Samsung Electronics <005930.KS>, the largest listing on the main bourse by market capitalization, rallied 2.5 percent after plumbing a series of 2-year record lows in recent session. The South Korean won <KRW=> drifted lower, pressured by a global dollar rally which has seen the greenback climb to a 4-year high against a basket of currencies.
