SEOUL, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's <005380.KS> labour union in South Korea decided to extend a partial strike over wages to next week, a union spokesman said on Friday, angered by the $10 billion bid to buy a plot of land in Seoul.

The union will stage a partial strike from Monday through Thursday, he said. The Hyundai-led group - which includes sister firms Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS> and Hyundai Mobis Co <012330.KS> - made the record $10 billion bid for land to house a headquarters, hotel and car theme park complex, more than triple the property's appraised amount.
