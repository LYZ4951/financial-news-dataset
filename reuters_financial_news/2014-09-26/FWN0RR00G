PARIS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> said on Friday its board had proposed Jean Lemierre, a former head of Europe's reconstruction bank, as the new chairman of France's biggest lender.

"During its meeting today, the board of directors of BNP Paribas acknowledged Baudouin Prot's decision to step down as chairman and director as of Dec. 1, 2014," BNP said in a statement, adding that the board would meet again at that date to formally appoint Lemierre. Reuters reported earlier this week that Baudouin Prot, who had shaped BNP's strategy for more than a decade, had quit and that Lemierre was set to replace him.
