SHANGHAI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Chinese money rates fell this week as big cash injections by the central bank more than offset demand related to the end of the quarter as well as a slew of initial public offerings.

The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day repo rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> fell 3.9 basis points (bps) to 3.3 percent. The 14-day rate <CN14DRP=CFXS> dropped 7.4 bps to 3.51 percent, while the shortest overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> lost 18 bps to 2.66 percent. Liquidity was ample after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) issued 500 billion yuan ($81.5 billion) of three-month loans to the top five banks via a policy tool known as the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) to support the economy.[ID:nL3N0RK3K7] The tool, similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve's discount window or the European Central Bank's marginal lending facility, allows banks to use the cash any time they need. "There was an abundance of liquidity in the market as big banks were generous in lending money this week," said a dealer at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai. "The market will certainly be able to deal with the seasonal liquidity demand this quarter-end." Liquidity typically tightens at the end of the quarter when banks need extra money to meet regulatory requirements, such as a 75 percent loan-to-deposit ratio. This time they also have to contend with a slew of IPOs, which have frozen large amounts of subscription funds. China's five biggest state-owned banks, the net lenders and major fund suppliers in the Chinese market, account for more than 50 percent of total lending. Traders, however, point out the short-term SLF operations imply the government is wary of offering "big bang" stimulus in the way it did during the 2009 global financial crisis. China will not dramatically alter economic policy because of any one economic indicator, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said on Sunday, days after many economists lowered growth forecasts after the latest set of weak data.
