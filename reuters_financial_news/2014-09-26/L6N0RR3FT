NAIROBI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Kenya's Nairobi Securities Exchange <NSE.NR> launched on Friday a new system for trading corporate and government bonds that will enable the trading of bonds issued in foreign currencies.

The 60-year-old exchange, which listed its own shares earlier this month, plans to use the funds raised from that sale to offer more products including trading of futures.
