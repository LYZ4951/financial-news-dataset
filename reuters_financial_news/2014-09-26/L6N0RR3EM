LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Gains in bank shares helped Britain's top equity index climb on Friday, bringing to a close one of its worst weeks of the year in the wake of retailer Tesco's financial woes.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> rose by 0.2 percent, or 9.68 points, to 6,649.39 points. Banks gave the biggest lift to the market on Friday, with the FTSE 350 Banking Index <.FTNMX8350> advancing by 0.5 percent on signs that a regulatory probe into alleged foreign exchange rate manipulation may soon be settled. [ID:nL6N0RR1MR] The Financial Conduct Authority held talks this week with six banks over a co-ordinated settlement after its investigation into allegations of collusion and manipulation in the global currency market, banking sources told Reuters. [ID:nL6N0RR29B] The settlement would see banks pay different sums depending on the gravity of transgression, which could total just under 2 billion pounds ($3.3 billion), the sources said. Justin Haque, a director at Hobart Capital Markets, said a settlement on this scale would be a relief for the sector as some had expected a bigger figure. Standard Chartered <STAN.L> and HSBC <HSBA.L>, which have a big business presence in India, got a further lift as Indian shares rose after Standard & Poor's raised its sovereign credit outlook on India to "stable" from "negative". [ID:nL3N0RR3BB] However, some traders felt the FTSE would make little progress in the near term, with the index down 2.8 percent over the week as a profit warning from supermarket retailer Tesco <TSCO.L> took its toll on the market.  U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State militants have also made some investors wary of buying up new equity positions.
