HONG KONG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices, which compiles several of the world's most widely tracked stock benchmarks, said on Friday Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <BABA.N> would be added to one of its indices after a fast-track analysis because of its record-sized IPO.

The company, whose initial public offering raised $25 billion to become the world's largest ever, will be added to the Dow Jones China Offshore 50 Index <.DJCHOS50> effective after the close of trading on Oct. 2, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.
