HONG KONG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Shanghai shares finished at their highest level in more than 1-1/2 years on Friday, as companies linked to agriculture and nuclear power rose on hopes for reform and expansion in those areas.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> inched up 0.1 percent to 2,348.36 points, the highest close since March 1, 2013. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings ended flat. The two indexes were up 0.8 and 0.5 percent on the week, respectively. Companies linked to nuclear power production were key outperformers for a second day, after the 21st Century Business Herald said the National Energy Administration met on Thursday to discuss restarting nuclear projects. Shanghai Electric Group <601727.SS> soared the 10 percent daily limit and China XD Electric <601179.SS> jumped 5.1 percent.
