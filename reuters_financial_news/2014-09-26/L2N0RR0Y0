NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Investors worldwide poured $3.8 billion into bond funds in the week ended Sept. 24, marking their biggest inflows in four weeks, data from a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report showed on Friday.

The inflows reversed $3.8 billion in outflows the prior week, which were the biggest of 2014. High-yield bond funds posted $200 million in outflows, marking their fourth straight week of withdrawals, according to the report, which also cited data from fund-tracker EPFR Global.
