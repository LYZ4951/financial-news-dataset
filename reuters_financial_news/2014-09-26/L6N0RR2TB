KIEV, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine will service a two-year $3 billion Eurobond held by Russia in accordance with the conditions of the issue and will be ready to repay it in 2015, a senior Ukrainian Finance Ministry official told Reuters on Friday.

Galina Pakhachuk said that Kiev is ready to repay the debt early, before its maturity in December 2015, if the country's debt level crosses 60 percent of nominal gross domestic product, as envisaged in the bond's covenant.
