MUMBAI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - India's market regulator on Friday notified the final rules for setting up of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts.

The notification comes after Securities and Exchange Board of India last month said REITs should operate with an asset pool of at least 5 billion rupees ($81.8 million) and have an initial issue size of at least 2.5 billion rupees for shareholders. [ID:nL4N0QG0AO]
