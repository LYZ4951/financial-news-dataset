Sept 26 (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value LP said Yahoo Inc <YHOO.O> should consider a strategic combination with AOL Inc <AOL.N> to save more than $1 billion in costs.

Starboard also urged Yahoo to cut expenses and look for ways to generate value for shareholders from its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <BABA.N> and Yahoo Japan Corp <4689.T>. Starboard said it had acquired a significant stake in Yahoo and delivered a letter to Yahoo's board with its suggestions. [ID:nPn3kCrHw]
