NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Pimco's Total Return bond exchanged-traded fund fell 0.3 percent in heavy volume early Friday after news its manager Bill Gross will leave Pimco for rival asset management firm Janus Capital Group <JNS.N>

Gross's surprise departure from the firm he founded came two days after news the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Pimco inflated the returns of its Total Return ETF, which has $3.6 billion in assets.
