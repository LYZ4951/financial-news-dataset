COPENHAGEN, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Danish brokerage firm Nykredit Markets said on Friday it would evaluate its trading system after one of its traders accidentally typed in wrong quotes for A.P. Moller-Maersk <MAERSKb.CO> on Thursday.

"We made an annoying error during the closing auction. We have therefore decided to evaluate human and technical routines to prevent that from happening in the future," head of Credit & Equity Products Jan Mathiesen told Reuters. The Nykredit Markets trader accidentally created an order to sell 14,000 shares in A.P. Moller-Maersk <MAERSKb.CO> at 4 Danish crowns each.  Shares in the firm were trading at around 14,550 crowns at 1348 GMT on Friday and other traders were setting bid and ask prices at around 14,000 Danish crowns ($2,396) at the close of trade on Thursday. The shares were not traded at 4 Danish crowns since it happen during the closing auction. However, the bid contributed to A.P. Moller-Maersk shares closing down 3.3 percent at the end of trade on Thursday.  Shares bounced back on Friday, trading 3.9 percent higher at 14,520 crowns. A spokesman at Nasdaq OMX in Copenhagen told Reuters that the stock exchange urged brokerage firms to adopt handbrakes in their computer systems which alert traders if prices differ by certain percentages. Jan Mathiesen declined to say if Nykredit Markets' systems include that function. He also declined to disclose the loss for Nykredit but said no customers would be affected by its mistake.
