Sept 26 (Reuters) - Bill Gross, the money manager who earned the unofficial title of the Bond King for his prowess in running Pimco's flagship bond fund, took the industry by surprise on Friday by quitting Pimco for distant rival Janus Capital Group <JNS.N.>. The move came the day before Gross was expected to be fired by the firm he helped to co-found.
