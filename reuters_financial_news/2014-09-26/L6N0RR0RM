MOSCOW, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine's claims about the illegality of a $3 billion bailout bond issue purchased by Moscow in December and organised by Russia's VTB Capital are baseless, VTB <VTBR.MM> said in a statement on Friday.

On Thursday, Ukraine's security service opened a criminal probe into former finance minister Yuriy Kolobov over the Russian bailout, saying Kolobov, among others, had abused his office and violated the budget law by organising the Eurobond sale. [ID:nL6N0RQ54E] Kiev alleges as well that the placement of the bond includes an illegal transfer of a $450,000 fee to VTB Capital.
