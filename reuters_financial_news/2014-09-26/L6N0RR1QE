LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Willis Capital Markets & Advisory (WCMA), part of Willis Group Holdings <WSH.N> said on Friday it had structured and placed a $250 million catastrophe bond deal with California's largest provider of workplace insurance.

The bond, 'Golden State Re II', is the second time the State Compensation Insurance Fund has issued a cat-bond, Willis said in a statement.  The deal, which closed on Sept. 16, provides the fund with fully collateralised protection for workers' compensation against a California earthquake over slightly more than four years and three months.
