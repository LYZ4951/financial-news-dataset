LONDON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - European shares edged lower to trade near a one-month trough early on Friday, with a sharp sell-off in U.S. and Asian equities leading investors to stay cautious on the last trading day of the week.

The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,370.02 points by 0708 GMT after setting its lowest level in almost a month in the previous session. U.S. stocks suffered sharp losses on Thursday, with the S&P 500 suffering its biggest one-day drop since July as Apple shares <AAPL.O> tumbled and the dollar rose to a four-year high. Major U.S. stock indexes fell 1.5 to 1.9 percent.[ID:nL2N0RQ2GY] The dollar <.DXY> held near a four-year high against a basket of major currencies, and further gains looked likely for the U.S. currency as it boasted its the biggest yield advantage over the euro in 15 years. A rise in the U.S. currency also tends to make metals costlier for holders of other currencies and lowers demand for raw materials, which in turn could hit miners.
