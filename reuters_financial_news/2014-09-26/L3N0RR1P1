Sept 26 (Reuters) - District attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles have accused ridesharing service Sidecar Inc of violating California business law and threatened an injunction on its service, the Wall Street Journal reported citing a letter sent to Sidecar and reviewed by the paper.

Sidecar's rivals in San Francisco, Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc, were also issued similar letters, the WSJ quoted a spokeswoman for the San Francisco district attorney's office as saying. (http://on.wsj.com/1puYVJQ) The attorneys have asked Sidecar to end its carpooling feature as it violates a section of the public utilities code, which restricts service providers from charging multiple people for the same ride, the paper reported.  George Gascon and Jackie Lacy, district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles respectively, also accused the ridesharing service of misleading users on how extensively it conducts background checks on its drivers' criminal and driving records, the report said. Sidecar, Uber and Lyft could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours. Ridesharing services like Uber have faced protests from taxi unions worldwide. Last week, a Frankfurt Regional Court granted a reprieve to Uber, setting aside a temporary injunction against the Silicon Valley company from operating a novel car-sharing service across Germany.
