FRANKFURT, Sept 26 (Reuters) - German insurer Allianz SE <ALVG.DE> on Friday said there was no sign that the resignation of Pimco Chief Investment Officer Bill Gross was linked to a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into an exchange traded fund (ETF) run by Gross.

"We were given no indication that this has anything to do with the SEC inquiry," a spokeswoman for Europe's largest insurer said.
