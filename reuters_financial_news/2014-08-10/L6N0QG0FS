DUBAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Kuwait Projects Company <KPRO.KW> (KIPCO) has rejected a $3.2 billion takeover offer from a U.S. private equity firm for its pay-television subsidiary OSN, the parent company said in a bourse filing on Sunday.

KIPCO owns 60.5 percent of OSN while Saudi Arabia-based Mawarid Group holds the remainder. They jointly refused an offer from the U.S. firm, which was not identified in the statement. The offer comprised $2.4 billion in cash and a further $800 million subject to certain conditions, according to KIPCO. It said the offer was for between 51 and 100 percent of OSN; it did not elaborate. Dubai-based brokerage Arqaam Capital last year valued OSN at $4.3 billion.  The TV company has operations across the Middle East and North Africa, and posted earnings of 139.5 million dinars ($494 million) in 2013. [ID:nL6N0PV0TG]
