HONG KONG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The cross-border stock investment scheme between Shanghai and Hong Kong is being developed to bridge the differences between the Chinese onshore and offshore markets, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) <0388.HK> Chief Executive Charles Li said in a statement on Sunday.

Li said it would be a long process for the mainland market to open and to align with the Hong Kong market, according to the statement published on the HKEx website.

We needed to build a bridge connecting the two markets without fundamentally changing them," he said. The so-called Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme is expected to kick off in October, with no fixed date announced. Under the scheme, foreign investors will place buy or sell orders on Shanghai's A-share market through brokers located in Hong Kong, while Chinese who want to invest in Hong Kong's H-share market will be able to use brokers in the mainland.

Earlier on Wednesday, Li said at a press conference that lingering tax and rights problems related to the exchange connection would be resolved before the October launch. [ID:nL4N0QC32C]
