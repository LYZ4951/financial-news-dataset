DUBAI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Dubai's market may rise on Sunday after local mortgage lender Amlak Finance <AMLK.DU> said all its creditors had approved a plan to restructure its debt, but the conflict in Iraqi Kurdistan may weigh on some individual Gulf shares.

Amlak's debt restructuring talks were the last major hangover from Dubai's property market crash of 2008. Its announcement, made after the market close on Thursday, was not unexpected but was good news in particular for Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU>, which owns 45 percent of Amlak. Emaar shares rose 1.6 percent on Thursday, possibly in anticipation of the announcement.

[ID:nL6N0QG02W] The global market environment improved at the end of last week, with the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rising 1.1 percent on Friday after Russia said it had ended military drills near Ukraine. [ID:nL2N0QE1ZJ] However, the fighting near the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Arbil may weigh on some individual Gulf stocks. In European markets, Iraqi Kurdistan-focused companies' shares fell sharply on Thursday and Friday as investors reassessed the region's security. [ID:nL4N0QF080] The insurgency in Iraq has not hurt overall market confidence in the Gulf; investors still see no direct impact on the Gulf Cooperation Council, where currency forwards and credit default swaps have not risen in response to Iraq. Limited U.S. air strikes to defend Arbil may eventually help to roll back the insurgency. But several Gulf stocks with exposure to Iraqi Kurdistan could face fresh pressure in coming days. Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA) <TAQA.AD> said at the weekend that it had suspended its activity at the Atrush Block in Kurdistan because of the instability. [ID:nL4N0QF081] Dana Gas <DANA.AD> said last Wednesday that the company's operations in Kurdistan were continuing normally with no security threats so far. It has not issued a fresh statement on the issue since then. [ID:nL6N0QC1R1]
