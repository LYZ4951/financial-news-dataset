JOHANNESBURG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The South African Reserve Bank will make an announcement about planned measures for troubled mass-market lender African Bank Investments <ABLJ.J> at 1400 GMT on Sunday, the central bank said in a statement on its website.

Investors fled shares of the bank last week after the unsecured lender said it needed to raise 8.5 billion rand ($800 million) from a flood of loans gone bad, raising concerns about its ability to ride out the crisis. [ID:nL6N0QD361]
