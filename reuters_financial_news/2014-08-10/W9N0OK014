WELLINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand stock exchange operator NZX Ltd <NZX.NZ> reported an 8.3 percent rise in first half profit on Monday, as strong financial markets and new listings lifted revenue.

The company declared an unchnaged dividend of 3 cents a share. NZX said it expected further revenue growth from new listings, and was looking at possible acquisitions in the funds management sector.
