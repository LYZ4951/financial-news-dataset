LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - A Jersey court has postponed the trial date for a case involving leading hedge fund Brevan Howard and its co-founder Christopher Rokos to March 2015, to determine whether the former star trader can launch a new rival firm.

Rokos, who made about $4 billion for Brevan's main fund between 2004 and 2012, filed a lawsuit in May seeking to overturn an agreement with the firm preventing him from starting his own fund and raising money from investors until 2018.
