MOSCOW, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Russia's consumer price inflation may exceed 7.5 percent this year, central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.

The bank has an inflation target of 5 percent plus/minus 1.5 percentage points for this year. However, its latest forecasts make clear the target will be missed. "Inflation, pressured by external and unpredictable factors, has accelerated significantly," Nabiullina told a weekly government meeting.
