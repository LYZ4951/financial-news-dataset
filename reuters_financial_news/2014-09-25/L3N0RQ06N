HANOI, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Foreign investors have ploughed an estimated $8.9 billion in Vietnam-based projects during the first nine months of this year, up 3.2 percent from a year ago, a government agency said on Thursday.

But new investment pledges in the January-September period is down 17.8 percent from a year ago to an estimated $7.64 billion, the Planning and Investment Ministry-run Foreign Investment Department said in a report on its website.

FDI inflows to Vietnam could reach $11.5 billion to $12 billion for the whole of 2014, below the country's requirement for funding infrastructure projects, based on a government projection.
