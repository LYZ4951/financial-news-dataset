CAIRO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday, with the bank saying it sold $39.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds per dollar, unchanged from Wednesday's rate.

In the unofficial market, the pound was weaker, trading at 7.39 to the dollar compared to 7.37 on Wednesday. The rate for dollar sales has stayed in a tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. The central bank offered $40 million on Thursday.
