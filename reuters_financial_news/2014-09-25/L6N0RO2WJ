TIRANA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Albania will end 2014 with a smaller budget deficit than initially targeted, according to a revised budget law passed on Thursday, after tax receipts exceeded expectations.

The deficit target of 6.3 percent of output has been lowered from 6.6 percent in the original budget, passed in December, meaning the government will start reducing the shortfall a year earlier than agreed with the International Monetary Fund. "Having achieved a target beyond the ambitious one set with the IMF, we managed to finance the cutting of the deficit and public debt this year despite agreeing with the IMF to start doing it next year," Prime Minister Edi Rama told parliament. The budget was revised after tax authorities raked in 3.2 billion leks ($29 million) more than targeted. Total tax receipts in January-August were $260 million more than the same period of 2013, a parliamentary election year. The new budget also reallocates some 15 billion leks ($136 million) from dormant projects to well-performing ones to help meet 2014 spending targets, Finance Minister Shkelqim Cani said. Albania's gross domestic product expanded by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter and Cani said indirect data suggested the economy was gaining momentum after growth slowed to 0.44 percent last year, the lowest in 16 years. Cani said real growth - adjusted for inflation - would be 2.1 percent in 2014, in line with targets. "The other main reason for the budget review is to get capital spending on a new dynamic, taking the money from projects with bad performance and passing it to projects with better performance," Cani had earlier told lawmakers. Road-building projects using foreign financing have lagged behind schedule.  The government also changed the structure of the budget financing for the remainder of the year, decreasing its reliance on foreign financing. Overall spending will not change.
