FRANKFURT, Sept 25 (Reuters) - German engineering group Duerr AG <DUEG.DE> could eventually buy the rest of Broetje from Deutsche Beteiligungs AG (DBAG) <DBANn.DE> as it seeks to reduce its dependence on automotive customers, its chief executive said.

"DBAG is a private equity investor and will eventually exit. So I do not rule out a takeover at a later point in time," Ralf Dieter said, according to an interview published in business daily Boersen-Zeitung on Thursday. Duerr last month merged its aircraft assembly technology business with Broetje, which Dieter said counts Boeing Co <BA.N> among its customers, and received an 11 percent stake in the engineering group as part of the deal. [ID:nWEB00RAW] Duerr this year also took over German woodworking equipment specialist Homag Group AG <HG1G.DE> as part of a drive for more diversification. [ID:nL6N0PQ4AY]
