BUDAPEST, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Banks' refunds to borrowers on past loans could lift Hungary's economic growth by 0.2-0.3 percent next year through higher consumption, the National Bank of Hungary said on Thursday in its quarterly inflation report.

Banks operating in Hungary will have to pay refunds to clients on past loans after a court and the government said they overcharged borrowers. The central bank has estimated that banks' refunds could top 3 billion euros.
