SAO PAULO, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Brazilian policymakers are likely to roll over 100 percent of the currency swaps that expire in November in a bid to curb a sharp depreciation of the real, a source on President Dilma Rousseff's economic team said on Thursday.

"There is a very reasonable possibility" that we do so, the source told Reuters when asked whether the bank would keep next month its increased rollover pace of currency swaps, derivatives designed to support the real. The central bank on Tuesday announced it would intensify its currency intervention after the real closed weaker than 2.4 per dollar for the first time in seven months. [ID:nL2N0RO2Z2] Despite the bank's efforts, the Brazilian currency continued to slide on Thursday, closing at a fresh seven-month low of 2.4294 per dollar.
