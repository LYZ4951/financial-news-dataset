WASHINGTON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday said US Bancorp <USB.N> agreed to pay about $57 million because of problems related to identity theft protection products it sold consumers.

The OCC said US Bank would pay it a $4 million civil penalty and a separate $5 million fine to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It also must pay about $48 million to harmed borrowers.
