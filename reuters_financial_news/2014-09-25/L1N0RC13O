NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's <GS.N> private equity arm and buyout firm Rhone Capital LLC are nearing a deal to acquire logistics services provider Neovia Logistics LLC for more than $1 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs' and Rhone Capital's consortium has prevailed over a rival bid from private equity firm Blackstone Group LP <BX.N>, the people said on Wednesday. The deal is expected to be finalized later this month, the people added. The sale of Neovia comes just two years after private equity firm Platinum Equity LLC acquired a 65 percent stake in the company from Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N>, leaving the industrial conglomerate with a 35 percent interest. The sources asked not to be identified because the deal talks are confidential. Representatives for Neovia, Platinum Equity, Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs and Rhone Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Blackstone declined to comment.  Neovia runs a third-party logistics business that helps companies cut distribution costs in sectors ranging from automotive and mining to electronics and healthcare. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company has more than 96 facilities in 25 countries, according to its website. Reuters first reported in April that Neovia was up for sale. Investment banks UBS AG <UBSN.VX> and Macquarie Group Ltd <MQG.AX> have been advising Neovia on the sale process, according to the sources. [ID:nL2N0NG1WY] Platinum said in 2012 when it took over Neovia that the overall transaction was worth about $750 million. At the time, Macquarie, which financed the deal, said it was the largest logistics deal since 2008.  The auction for Neovia also attracted peer XPO Logistics Inc <XPO.N>, which exited the process in recent weeks, according to the sources. Greenwich, Connecticut-based XPO went on to acquire another company, New Breed Logistics, in a $615 million deal from private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC earlier this month. An XPO spokesman declined to comment on the company's interest in Neovia. A wave of deals in the industrial logistics sector have taken place this year. French logistics company Groupe Norbert Dentressangle SA <GNDP.PA>, for example, completed its $750 million purchase of Jacobson Companies from private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners on Sept. 2.
