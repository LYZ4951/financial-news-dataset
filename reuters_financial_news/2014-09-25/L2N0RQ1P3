NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Texas tycoon Sam Wyly and his late brother Charles' estate must pay $187.7 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a fraudulent offshore scheme, a U.S. judge said on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York ruled that the Wylys brothers must also pay an undetermined amount of interest that appears likely to add significantly to the total.
