MOSCOW, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Ukraine is doing everything to either declare its $3 billion bailout bond held by Moscow invalid or not to repay its debts, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told Reuters on Thursday.

Russia bought $3 billion worth of Ukraine's Eurobonds in December, before relations between the two plunged to new lows when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was toppled.  Since then Moscow has annexed Ukraine's Crimea region and pro-Russian rebels have fought Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine. On Thursday, Ukraine's security service opened a criminal probe into former Finance Minister Yuriy Kolobov over the Russian bailout, saying Kolobov among others abused his office and violated the budget law by organising the bond sale.
