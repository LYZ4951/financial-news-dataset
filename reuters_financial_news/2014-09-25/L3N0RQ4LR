Sept 25 (Reuters) - At least six state investment firms are interested in buying the property assets of restaurant and packaged food company Bob Evans Farms Inc <BOBE.O>, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The bidders include Spirit Realty Capital Inc <SRC.N>, American Realty Capital Properties Inc <ARCP.O>, Store Capital and National Retail Properties Inc <NNN.N>, the Journal reported. (http://on.wsj.com/1xnsnuf) Bob Evans shares were down 1 percent at $47.08 in early trading on Thursday on the Nasdaq. Shareholder Sandell Asset Management Corp said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had been contacted by several investment firms interested in buying Bob Evans' real estate assets. (http://1.usa.gov/1B79bhK) The hedge fund said it had also been contacted by a private equity firm that was interested in discussing a deal for Bob Evans' food products division, BEF Foods. Sandell Asset has been urging the company to separate its food-products business and "unlock real estate value" embedded in its restaurant properties through a sale-leaseback transaction.
