HONG KONG, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares skidded to their lowest close in more than 9 weeks on Thursday, fuelled by selling on concerns over unrest in the territory as pro-democracy activists prepare for a major protest in their "Occupy Central" campaign on Oct. 1.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended down 0.6 percent at 23,768.13 points, the weakest close since July 21. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 0.7 percent. Gaming stocks led the slide with Galaxy Entertainment <0027.HK> falling 3.5 percent and Sands China <1928.HK> down nearly three percent on anticipation of a drop in Macau gaming revenue in September.
