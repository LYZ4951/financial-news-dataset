LAGOS, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Shares in Nigeria's Access Bank <ACCESS.LG> fell 8.2 percent on Thursday after the bourse lifted a week old price freeze on the stocks, pending a proposed shareholder vote on its 68 billion naira rights issue on Oct. 13.

The Nigerian Stock Exchange froze the bank's shares last week after it said it planned to raise fresh capital of about 68 billion nigerian naira ($415.95 million) in a rights issue, but Access applied to have the freeze lifted because the information on the issue was now widely available.
