BUCHAREST, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Thursday it was opening infringement procedures against Bulgaria over its ongoing bank crisis and expects that customers at Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> be given immediate access to their deposits.

The Commission has sent a formal notice to Bulgaria, and Sofia has until Oct. 15 to respond.  A run on deposits at Corpbank in June prompted the Bulgarian central bank to seize control of the country's fourth-largest lender and freeze its operations. That has sparked a growing backlash from customers unable to access their accounts.
