SINGAPORE, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC said on Thursday it had bought a stake in RAC Ltd, Britain's second biggest roadside recovery firm, from private equity fund Carlyle Group <CG.O> for an undisclosed amount.

GIC did not specify the size of the stake it had bought, but said it was now a majority owner along with Carlyle Group, which has owned RAC Ltd since 2011.
