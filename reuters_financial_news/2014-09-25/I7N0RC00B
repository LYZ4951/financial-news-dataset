ISTANBUL, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The Turkish central bank said on Thursday that it would maintain a tight monetary policy until there is a clear improvement in the inflation outlook.

In a statement accompanying its interest rate decision, the bank also said high food prices were delaying any improvement in the inflation outlook. Falling commodity prices could limit upward risks to inflation, it said.
