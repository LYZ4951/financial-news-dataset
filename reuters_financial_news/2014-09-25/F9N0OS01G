FRANKFURT, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Lending to euro zone households and companies contracted for the 28th month in a row in August, although at a slightly slower pace, despite the European Central Bank stepping up its efforts to get credit flowing again and revive growth.

Euro zone banks, particularly in the crisis-stricken countries, have tightened their purse strings as they adapt to tougher capital requirements and undergo health checks, while companies are holding back on investments, unsure of the future. To solve the problem, the ECB has started to offer banks four-year loans at ultra-cheap rates and plans to buy asset-backed securities and covered bonds from October to lighten the weight on banks' balance sheets and entice them to lend. But these measures will take time to gain traction.  In August, loans to the private sector fell 1.5 percent from the same month a year earlier, after a contraction of 1.6 percent in July, ECB data showed on Thursday.
