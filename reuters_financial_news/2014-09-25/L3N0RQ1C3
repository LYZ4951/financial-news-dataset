SHANGHAI, Aug 28 (Reuters) - China's money rates dropped sharply on Thursday as a fund drain by the central bank still left an abundance of liquidity in the market, traders said.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) drained 18 billion yuan ($2.93 billion) from the money markets through 14-day bond repurchase agreements in Thursday's operations and bringing the net drain for the week to 11 billion yuan. [CN/MMT] Still, strong cash flows were ensured after PBOC issued 500 billion yuan ($81.5 billion) worth of three-month loans to the top five biggest banks via a policy tool known as Standing Lending Facility (SLF), traders said. [ID:nL3N0RK3K7] The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day repo rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> fell 8 basis points (bps) to 3.26 percent, while the 14-day rate <CN14DRP=CFXS> slumped 15 bps to 3.42 percent. Liquidity conditions typically grow tight at the end of a quarter, when banks need extra money to meet regulatory requirements, such as a 75-percent loan-to-deposit ratio. This quarter-end also sees a slew of initial public offerings, which will freeze large amounts of subscription funds for a short period of time. "Thanks to the PBOC's SLF injection, the markets are expected to weather the seasonal liquidity demand at this quarter-end very easily," said a trader at a major Chinese state-owned bank in Shanghai.
