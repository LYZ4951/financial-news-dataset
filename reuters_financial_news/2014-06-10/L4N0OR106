SEOUL, June 10 (Reuters) - South Korean shares posted their best daily gains in four weeks on Tuesday, helped by persistent foreign capital inflows, while the won <KRW=> closed weaker after a media report that authorities would inspect bank dealing activities for one-sided movements near the market close.

However, a foreign exchange official told Reuters that there were no plans to carry out inspections, though factors behind surges in dollar/won trading near the end of onshore trade were under scrutiny. [ID:nL4N0OR1DW] The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,017.2 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, easing 0.1 percent from Monday's 1,016.2. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 1.1 percent at 2,011.80 points, the best daily percentage rise since a 1.4 percent gain on May 14.
