LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group <IMT.L> said on Tuesday it intended to float its European logistics division Logista on the Spanish stock market after a review of options for the Madrid-based unit.

The world's fourth-largest international tobacco group said its indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary Altadis would sell a portion of shares in Logista to institutional investors in an initial public offer.
