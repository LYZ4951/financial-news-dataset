PARIS, June 10 (Reuters) - Francois Hollande's top economic advisor is standing down and will be replaced by a senior economist from a U.S. bank, an official at the French presidency said on Tuesday.

Emmanuel Macron will be replaced by Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief European economist Laurence Boone, the official said confirming a report in Le Monde newspaper. Prior to joining Merrill Lynch in London, Boone was an economist at Barclays in Paris and worked previously at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. As deputy chief of staff, Macron played a key role steering economic policy as Hollande struggled to revive the euro zone's second-biggest economy towards a much promised but little seen recovery.
