FRANKFURT, June 10 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC <FIG.N> is set to place shares in German real estate group Gagfah SA <GFJG.DE> at 12.34 euros ($16.80) each, two financial sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

Gagfah said the sale of the remaining shares, nearly 60 million in all, held by Fortress was the "final logical step" to end its involvement in the real estate group. The share placement was organised by Deutsche Bank. The bank and Gagfah declined comment on the price.
