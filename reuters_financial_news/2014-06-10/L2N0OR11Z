WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator on Tuesday named former federal prosecutor Aitan Goelman as its new head of enforcement, a first visible move by the agency's new chairman, Timothy Massad.

Goelman previously was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, and was one of the trial lawyers that convicted the Oklahoma City bombers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.
