FRANKFURT, June 10 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said on Tuesday the euro zone was not in crisis mode anymore and that policymakers must now secure long-term growth.

"We are not in the emergency mode any more," Coeure said during a panel discussion at a conference in Frankfurt. Last Thursday, the ECB cut interest rates to record lows, launched a series of measures to pump money into the sluggish euro zone economy, and pledged to do more if needed to fight off the risk of Japan-like deflation.
