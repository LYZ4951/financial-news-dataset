BUCHAREST, June 10 (Reuters) - Parliamentary hearings and a vote on a new board for the Romanian central bank were postponed by one week, the head of the lower house's budget commission told Reuters.

"This is being moved to next Monday from today for technical reasons," Eugen Nicolaescu said, explaining more time was needed to schedule hearings for board members of the Court of Accounts and the Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company the same day. The central bank is run by a board of nine members, who are appointed by parliament for renewable five-year terms. Those terms expire this year. Prime Minister Victor Ponta said earlier in June his ruling leftist coalition would endorse Governor Mugur Isarescu for a new mandate.[ID:nL6N0OJ4DQ] Following his comments, parliament set a June 10 date for hearings.
