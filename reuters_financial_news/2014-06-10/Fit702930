June 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed China-based Huaxia Life  Insurance Company Limited's (HXLF) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at  'A-'. The Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects HXLF's good distribution capabilities, dynamic new business  growth, significant increase in value of in-force business, and adequate capital  cushion. However, continued operating losses and high concentration on  single-premium participating and universal life products will continue to  constrain the company's rating.   Despite the challenging market environment, sales of universal life insurance  policies have remained strong for HXLF. The company became China's third-largest  life insurer in terms of new premiums for universal life products, seizing a  market share of about 10.3% in 2013. Its new business value and value of  in-force business (after the cost of capital) increased by 89% and 129%  respectively in 2013.   Persistent operating deficits due to expense overruns associated with  non-recurrent expansion costs and rapid premium expansion have weakened HXLF's  local solvency ratio to about 180% at end-2013 (end-2012: 203%) despite the  infusion of CNY5bn of fresh equity by its shareholders in 2013. HXLF will  maintain its solvency adequacy in 1H14 through a further increase in  shareholders' equity and planned issuance of subordinated debt. The additional  capital will also support its growth and provide a buffer against asset  volatility. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating triggers include a decline in HXLF's local solvency ratio to  below 200% on a sustained basis, an increase in financial leverage to above 25%  (end-2013: 6.1%) and a significant reduction in persistency rates and mortality  profits.An upgrade is unlikely in the near term unless the company is able to  consistently achieve positive operating earnings, optimise its business  composition, and further improve its new business margin.
