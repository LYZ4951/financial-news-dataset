LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - Swedish private equity firm EQT is planning to announce a London initial public offering (IPO) of food outlet operator SSP next week, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Sources told Reuters at the beginning of the year that SSP, which owns brands including Caffe Ritazza and Whistlestop, could be valued at around 2 billion pounds ($3.4 billion) including debt.
