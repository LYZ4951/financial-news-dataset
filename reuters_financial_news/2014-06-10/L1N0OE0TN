June 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court meets on Thursday to discuss whether to hear an appeal by Argentina in its long battle with holdout creditors that are seeking billions of dollars from the country stemming from its massive debt default in 2001/02.

If the top court decides not to take up the case, Buenos Aires risks a new default as U.S. authorities could prevent it making full payment to creditors holding bonds from debt swaps in 2005 and 2010 even though the country is able and willing to make the payments. [ID:nL2N0OR0P1] A "technical" default could happen as early as June 30, when Argentina has to transfer $228 million to the United States as payments are due on discount bonds governed by New York. The holdout creditors rejected Argentina's two debt-restructuring offers after the country defaulted on roughly $100 billion in 2001/02. Creditors holding about 93 percent of Argentina's bonds agreed to participate in the two debt swaps in 2005 and 2010, accepting between 25 and 29 cents on the dollar in exchange for regular payments. Lower courts in the United States have ruled that Argentina must pay holdout creditors back in full. But the government of President Cristina Fernandez has refused to pay the holdout bondholders under better terms than it offered in the two debt restructurings.
