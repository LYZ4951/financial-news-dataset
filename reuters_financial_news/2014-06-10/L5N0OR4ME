MILAN, June 10 (Reuters) - The composition of Italy's blue-chip FTSE MIB stock index <.FTMIB> will change temporarily starting from Tuesday to include the rights to buy into Monte dei Paschi's share sale as well as the Italian bank's ordinary stock, and a cash component.

"The FTSE MIB index will contain the three lines for BMPS," index provider FTSE said in a statement. "The rights and ordinary line will be based on market prices, and the cash dummy will be fixed at 1 euro" until June 20. From June 23 to June 27 the ordinary line will be based on market price, the cash component will be 1 euro and the rights line will reflect the theoretical value of the rights based on the underlying share price. The cash component and the rights will be removed from the FTSE MIB index on June 27. The number of ordinary shares will rise to around 1.8 billion from around 42,610,447 and to eventually reach 5.1 billion.
