SANTIAGO, June 10 (Reuters) - Chile's central bank is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate at 4.0 percent at its monetary policy meeting this week, according to a majority of market analysts surveyed in a central bank poll published on Tuesday.

Nearly 90 percent of the 60 analysts polled forecast a hold on Thursday, although opinion was split as to whether the bank would hold or cut in July.
