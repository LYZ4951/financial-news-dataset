June 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

US prime jumbo RMBS issued since the start of 2010 are  unlikely to see a meaningful increase in prepayments, even if interest rates  stay low. The resulting increased average life of the mortgages in these trusts  will increase the period of default risk, Fitch Ratings says. Despite a recent decline in mortgage rates, average annualized prepayment rates  for recent RMBS remained around 5% in May, down from 25% a year ago. We expect  the 2013 vintage to be one of the slowest prepaying vintages on record in US  RMBS as mortgage rates are unlikely to decline from the levels at which those  mortgages were originated. The slow prepayment behavior of recent RMBS could increase credit risk by  exposing the trust to a longer period of default risk. We believe the bonds in  the recent vintage RMBS transactions are largely protected against this risk by  the unusually strong initial credit characteristics of the borrowers. Borrowers  in the 2013 vintage, for example, benefitted initially from over 30% equity on  average and have generally experienced strong home price growth since  origination. If underwriting should loosen in the near term, the protection  against this term risk could decline.
