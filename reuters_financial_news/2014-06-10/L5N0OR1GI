DUBAI, June 10 (Reuters) - The malls unit of Dubai's Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> has set initial price thoughts on a debut Islamic bond issue of ten years duration, which is set to be sold this week, a document from lead managers said on Tuesday.

Pricing guidance for the benchmark-sized transaction has been given in the area of 200 basis points over midswaps, the document said. Benchmark size is traditionally understood to mean in excess of $500 million. Two Abu Dhabi-based banks - Al Hilal Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD> - have been added to the list of eight existing bookrunners for the deal, the document showed.
