June 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its EMEA CMBS and Loan Rating  criteria following publication of an exposure draft on 14 April 2014. The update  does not affect any existing ratings. The exposure draft requested feedback on the following areas (i) a widening of  the criteria scope to include loan ratings, (ii) enhanced disclosure on the  setting of key real estate assumptions and guidance ranges for those key  assumptions, and (iii) greater insight into Fitch's analysis of contracted  income. The criteria update is consistent with proposals of the exposure draft with the  following exceptions. Firstly, in addition to the exposure draft proposals the  criteria will also apply a rating cap to certain CMBS transactions in  jurisdictions (eg Italy) where judicial recovery timing is uncertain. Secondly,  the criteria report has been extended with respect to the loan rating  methodology to allow for greater credit for loans supported by strong covenant  package In jurisdictions (eg UK) where the power to enforce such covenants is  generally recognised by the courts. The criteria replace the report tilted "EMEA CMBS Rating Criteria" published on  3 April 2013.  Fitch would like to thank market participants for their feedback on this  criteria proposal. During the feedback period Fitch received two written  responses marked as confidential by the respondent. There were no other written  responses.
