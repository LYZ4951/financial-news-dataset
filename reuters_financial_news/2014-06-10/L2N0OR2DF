June 10 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital LP, says the 10-year U.S. Treasury note will likely be in a range between 2.20 percent and 2.80 percent during the second half of year.

In an investor webcast on Tuesday, Gundlach said U.S. Treasuries are "something of a high-yielding" security relative to European sovereign bonds.
