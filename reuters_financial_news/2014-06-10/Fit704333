June 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

This announcement corrects the version published on 2  June 2014  with regard to missing information on the underlying asset. There has  been no material impact on the analysis.  Fitch Ratings has affirmed VG Microfinance Invest Nr.1 GmbH EUR30.3m senior  notes at 'B+sf' with a Negative Outlook.  The transaction consists of subordinated credit exposure against 20 (initially  21) microfinance institutions globally distributed across 15 jurisdictions. The  institutions were selected by Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE> (A+/Stable/F1+) in its role as  seller and protection buyer.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the transaction's stable performance since the last  review. The portfolio composition is static and unchanged. Rating migration has  been limited and the portfolio's average rating is in the 'B'/'CCC' range.  The Negative Outlook reflects the substantial refinancing risk of the underlying  loans. All assets have a bullet amortisation profile and are scheduled to mature  in December 2014. One asset's maturity has been restructured and half of its  balance (EUR1m) will be repaid between January and June 2015. Fitch expects a  clustering of defaults on the loans' maturity date given most obligors' low  credit quality. Fitch does not expect any recoveries in case of default of the  assets given their subordinated nature.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
