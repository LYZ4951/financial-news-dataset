VIENNA, June 10 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's has put seven Austrian banks on CreditWatch negative on concerns about the government's plan to impose losses on holders of subordinated debt issued by nationalised lender Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL] and guaranteed by its home province of Carinthia, it said on Tuesday.

"This unexpected move was not our base-case scenario and in our view could signal a weakening of extraordinary state support for systemically important banks and for banks and grandfathered obligations that we consider government-related entities," the ratings agency said. The move, which also covers the banks' senior and grandfathered debt ratings, affects Erste Group Bank <ERST.VI>, Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> and its unlisted parent Raiffeisen Zentralbank [RZB.UL], UniCredit Bank Austria <CRDI.MI>, state-owned KA Finanz [KKAT.UL], Hypo NOe Gruppe Bank [NLSBHY.UL] and Oberoesterreichische Landesbank [OBERL.UL]. Austria is set to enter uncharted territory for bond markets when it unveils legislation on Wednesday designed to force some holders of Carinthia-guaranteed Hypo Alpe Adria debt to help pay for winding down the stricken nationalised bank.
