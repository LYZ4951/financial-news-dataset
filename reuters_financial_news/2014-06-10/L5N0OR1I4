MILAN, June 10 (Reuters) - Shares in bailed-out Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> failed to open and were indicated higher on the second day of a planned 5-billion euro rights issue.

The stock was indicated at 2.2160 euros compared to a closing level of 1.8480 euros on Monday adjusted for the share sale.  The highly dilutive cash call has been priced at a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP), a steep discount implicating a TERP of 1.55 euros. At 0711 GMT, Monte dei Paschi's rights <BMPS_r.MI> fell 3 percent to 20.81 euros.
