BANGKOK, June 10 (Reuters) - Thai shares rose to a near eight-month high on Tuesday, buoyed by a rally in Thai Airways after the military government said it would tackle expenses at state firms, while the Malaysian index ended at a near two-week high on plantation stocks.

Thai key SET index <.SETI> finished up 0.8 percent at 1,469.19, the highest since Oct. 18, 2013. Thai Airways International <THAI.BK> shares jumped 8.2 percent, their best gain in almost five months.

Shares of plantation firms PPB Group <PEPT.KL> and Kuala Lumpur Kepong <KLKK.KL> were among top percentage gainers.
