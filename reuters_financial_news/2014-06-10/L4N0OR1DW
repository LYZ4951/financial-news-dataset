SEOUL, June 10 (Reuters) - South Korea has no plans to inspect banks over foreign exchange trading but is looking into the surges in dollar/won trading near the end of the onshore session, a foreign exchange official told Reuters on Tuesday.

"The authorities are closely watching the pattern of deals for one direction (for the dollar/won) surging near the end of the session," the official said. The finance ministry and central bank are in charge of foreign exchange policies.
