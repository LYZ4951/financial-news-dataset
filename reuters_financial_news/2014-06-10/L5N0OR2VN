MADRID, June 10 (Reuters) - Spanish house prices fell 4 percent year-on-year in May, the smallest drop since March 2011, as a six-year property slump shows signs of turning a corner, an industry report showed on Tuesday.

Spain's economy is recovering from a prolonged recession after a burst property bubble in 2008, though unemployment running at almost 30 percent means Spaniards are hesitant to return to the housing market and battered banks are reluctant to lend. Spanish house prices fell by 4.7 percent in the previous month, and dropped by 10.4 percent in the same month last year, according to real estate surveyor firm Tinsa.  House prices have fallen 40 percent from their height in December 2007, according to Tinsa. The National Statistics Institute said on Monday that house prices dropped 1.6 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the lowest fall in almost four years.
