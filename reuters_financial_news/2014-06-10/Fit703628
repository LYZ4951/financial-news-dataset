June 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says it is evaluating the strategic  importance of Milleniumbcp-Ageas's operating entities (MBCPA; Insurer Financial  Strength (IFS) rating BBB-/Positive) to Ageas Insurance International NV (Ageas;  Long-term IDR:A-/Stable) following the recently announced deal with  Millenniumbcp (BB+/Negative).  Fitch views the transaction as potentially positive for MBCPA's non-life  operations. Under the terms of the deal, MBCPA's parent company Ageas will own  100% of Ocidental-Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros S.A. (Ocidental Seguros) and  Medis - Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros de Saude S.A. (Medis), Ageas's non-life  entities in Portugal.  Ageas agreed to pay EUR122.5m to acquire the 49% of Ocidental Seguros and Medis  currently indirectly owned by Millenniumbcp. Ocidental-Companhia Portuguesa de  Seguros de Vida S.A. will continue to be 51% indirectly owned by Ageas. Fitch believes that the planned acquisition fits into Ageas's strategy to focus  on non-life business and allows the group to broaden the scope of distribution  agreements in Portugal beyond Millenniumbcp.The announced price is a small  percentage of Ageas group's shareholders' funds (EUR8.5bn at FY13) and does not  affect the group's credit profile. The deal reinforces the degree of support from Ageas to its Portuguese non-life  entities, which Fitch views positively. MBCPA's ratings already benefit from a  single-notch uplift from Portugal's 'BB+' sovereign rating due to Ageas's  ownership.   Fitch will re-evaluate the strategic importance of MBCPA within the Ageas group  and the implications for MBCPA's ratings stemming from Ageas's acquiring full  control of the non-life entities. In its analysis, Fitch will apply its Group  Rating Methodology and determine the strategic importance of the Portuguese life  and non-life operations to Ageas. This analysis is expected to be completed over  the next few weeks.
