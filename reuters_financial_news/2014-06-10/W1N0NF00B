WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - Stanley Fischer's nomination to be vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday, setting the table for final approval later this week.

The Senate move set the clock ticking toward a final vote, which is scheduled for Thursday. He is widely expected to win confirmation.
