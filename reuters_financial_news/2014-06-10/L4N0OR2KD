June 10 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL * Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper insists he won't be pressured to alter his business-friendly climate-change policies, saying the Conservative government is simply more upfront than leadership in some other countries about its intention to avoid abatement measures that hurt jobs and economic growth. (http://r.reuters.com/jeg99v)  * Buyers in Calgary's housing market are contending with a limited supply of new homes. The available supply of completed new units dropped below 500 for the third time on record (back to 1992) in April. That helps explain why sales of condos - which are more affordable than houses - are up significantly. According to Calgary's real estate board, there were 2,020 condo apartment sales over the Multiple Listing Service during the first five months of the year, up 21 percent.

Ontario and Quebec must start reining in their deficits for the well-being of the rest of the country, Oliver said on Monday in Montreal.

(http://r.reuters.com/qeg99v)  * A man named Rafid Jihad has been charged with attempted murder in connection with a hammer attack on a 13-year-old boy in Windsor, Ontario. Police say the boy was walking along a street on Friday when a man struck him in the head several times with a hammer, causing multiple skull fractures.
