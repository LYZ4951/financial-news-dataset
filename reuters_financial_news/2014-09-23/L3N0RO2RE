JAKARTA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank forecasts annual growth in gross domestic product to slow further to 5.02 percent in the third quarter, from 5.12 percent in the second, a senior official said on Tuesday.

The growth is expected to weaken as Indonesia's business cycle slows in line with a trend in global commodity prices, Juda Agung, executive director of the department of economic and monetary policy at Bank Indonesia, told a news conference.
