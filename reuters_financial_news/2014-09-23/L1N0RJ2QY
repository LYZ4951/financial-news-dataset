SEPT. 22  MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA  (Currently has a vote on FOMC) Kocherlakota warned against raising rates while inflation is running below its 2-percent goal, saying that doing so could undermine the Fed's credibility and unmoor inflation expectations. "I think we need to be very cautious and careful about starting to raise rates, because we do want to be sure that inflation is on the path back to 2 percent," he told the Economic Club of Marquette County in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Kocherlakota said he does not expect inflation to reach 2 percent until 2018.  The Fed should impose a two-year deadline on reaching the Fed's inflation target, Kocherlakota added, a change that would help bring unemployment down faster [ID:nU5N0QE009] [ID:nL2N0RN25L]   NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY (Permanent voter on the Federal Open Market Committee) The Federal Reserve needs the U.S. economy "to run a little hot for at least some period of time" to push inflation back up to the Fed's 2-percent goal, Dudley said, adding that he wants to see the unemployment rate fall further before removing policy accommodation.  "You have to make sure that when you start to raise interest rates the economy can take it," he said. "I can certainly imagine a scenario where the unemployment rate dips a little bit below what we view as sustainable. That would be the mechanism to actually push inflation back up."  Most Fed officials see sustainable long-run unemployment at somewhere between 5.2 percent and 5.5 percent. He also said the steady rise in the dollar's value could complicate the Fed's job, potentially hurting U.S. economic performance and pushing down inflation.   "Inflation is quiescent for a very simple reason. We have excess slack in the economy," he said. "We are below the two-percent inflation target so that argues for more patience."

"Specifically, I did not support plans for the assets on the Fed's balance sheet," Lacker said on Friday. "The Fed's MBS holdings may put downward pressure on mortgage rates, compared to holding an equivalent amount of Treasury securities, but if so, then other borrowers would likely face higher interest rates ... While this would favor home mortgage borrowers, it tilts the playing field against other borrowing by consumers." [ID:nL1N0RK0N8]  DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER (Currently has a vote on FOMC) Fisher, who with Charles Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed dissented on the Fed's decision on Wednesday, said he wants to raise rates gradually, but start sooner than market participants now anticipate. "I personally would want to see, the date of our first move, I personally expect it to occur in the spring and not in the summer as it seems the markets are discounting," he said in an interview on Fox Business Network.  Speaking with Reuters later on Friday, he said he wants the rate hikes to be in quarter-point increments, but "it depends on the economy." Fisher expressed worries that inflation could rise, even though currently it is not a problem. He also said he was seeing financial excess in markets, particularly in high-yield bonds.  "I think we've levitated the markets," he said. "I don't want to drive this any further, and I think we have to be aware of this." [ID:nL1N0RK14P]   SEPT. 17  FOMC STATEMENT
