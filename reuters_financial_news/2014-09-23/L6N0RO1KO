DUBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Burgan Bank <BURG.KW> has launched a $500 million Tier 1 capital-boosting bond at 7.250 percent on Tuesday, and is expected to price the deal later in the day, according to lead managers.

The lender had set final guidance in the 7.25-7.375 percent range on Tuesday.

The bond, with a perpetual tenor, can be bought back by the lender after the fifth year. Investor orders for the issue grew to over $850 million, the document showed.
