BUDAPEST, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's interest rate should remain at its current record low for an extended period as inflationary pressures are expected to remain moderate in the medium term, the National Bank of Hungary said on Tuesday, after it left its rate on hold at 2.1 percent.

"The Council judges that, based on available information, the current level of the central bank base rate is consistent with the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support to the economy," the rate setting Monetary Council said in a statement.
