BERLIN, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Alstom's <ALSO.PA> purchase of General Electric's <GE.N> rail signalling unit is expected to close in the second quarter of next year, at the same time as a broader deal with GE on power, the head of the French group's transport unit said on Tuesday.

Alstom agreed in June on a 12.4 billion euro ($15.96 billion) deal that will see GE buy the bulk of its power business while it focuses on its better-performing rail arm.  "The closing of the global deal is not expected before Q2 of next year, and the two deals will be closed at the same time," Henri Poupart-Lafarge told reporters at the InnoTrans biennial rail trade fair in Berlin.
