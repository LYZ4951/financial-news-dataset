DUBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - HSBC Bank Middle East set pricing for a $300 million five-year bond offering at the tighter end of its initial guidance, with the deal to complete later on Tuesday, a document from the bank showed.

The lender, rated A2 by Moody's and AA- by Fitch, had set initial price guidance at between 85 basis points and 90 basis points over mid-swaps earlier in the day. [ID:nL6N0RO0G4] The order book was oversubscribed, according to the document, without specifying the size of the orders. HSBC is the sole bookrunner and lead manager. The bank follows a string of United Arab Emirates borrowers accessing the international debt market as favourable market conditions have pushed borrowing costs to record lows.
