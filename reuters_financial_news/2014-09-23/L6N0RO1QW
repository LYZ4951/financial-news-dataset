BUDAPEST, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Central European government bonds firmed on Tuesday after Hungary surprised by saying that it may tap international, rather than local, bond markets before the end of the year, potentially reducing domestic debt supply.

Hungary has been the least likely foreign currency bond issuer in the region but now is gearing up for an expected flood of money into European markets from European Central Bank stimulus, market participants said.  Economy Minister Mihaly Varga told public television channel m1 on Tuesday that the government could issue foreign currency debt this year if it could get favourable terms.  This was a surprise as the government had been strongly committed to selling only forint debt until the end of 2015 to cut the reliance of Central Europe's most indebted state on foreign financing. "This is totally against what they have been saying so far, with the central bank planning to cut its balance sheet and foreign debt," said Andras Balatoni, an analyst at ING Bank. One Budapest-based fixed income trader said it would be logical for the government to issue bonds in euros or Swiss francs, instead of dollar-denominated sales seen in recent years when U.S. markets were awash in money printed by the Federal Reserve. "People say that the ECB's TLTRO (cheap loan issue to banks last week) was a disappointment, but still it is Europe where demand (for bonds) could grow, while U.S. yields are rising," the trader said.Euro zone government bonds also firmed on Tuesday as regionwide business surveys showed a weaker-than-expected rise in business activity in September, putting further pressure on the ECB to deliver monetary stimulus. Hungarian bond yields dropped by 4-6 basis points along the curve, but sellers appeared by midday as yields are close to record lows. "Bonds firm, but struggling," another trader said.  The forint <EURHUF=> jumped half a percent against the euro to 310.85 by 1027 GMT, after touching a two-month low at 310.28, while other currencies in the region were treading water and stocks tracked euro zone equities lower. ING's Balatoni said Hungarian assets were probably helped by further comments from Varga, who said the government wanted to cut spending in the next few years. [ID:nL6N0RO16U]  Hungary's central bank is expected to keep its base rate at a record low of 2.1 percent at a policy meeting on Tuesday and maintain its commitment to keep monetary conditions loose through next year. It is expected to announce its rate decision at 1200 GMT. Polish bonds gave up some early gains, tracking German Bunds. Poland's central bank governor Marek Belka implied again on Tuesday that an interest rate cut is very likely next month, adding that the rate-setting panel would also debate whether a move larger than the standard 25 basis points is needed. [ID:nL6N0RO22Y] Data showing slower growth in retail sales last month also reinforced expectations for a rate cut next month. [ID:nL6N0RO1P5] Poland hired UBS <UBSN.VX> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> early this month as lead managers of a planned bond issue  denominated in Swiss francs. [ID:nL5N0RB0Y0] There has been no further news about the sale since then, with Poland swearing in a new government on Monday, led by Ewa Kopacz as prime minister, succeeding Donald Tusk who will become president of the European Council. Elsewhere in the region Serbia has also said that it would consider returning to international bond markets later this year, if a much-awaited government plan to cut spending opens the way for credit talks with the International Monetary Fund. Romanian bond yields were bid higher by a few basis points due to a continuing liquidity shortage in local markets. The central bank is expected to cut its main interest rate late this month.  BANK STOCKS FALL The shares of Austria's Raiffeisen <RBI.VI>, a major regional bank, plunged more than 10 percent after it said new sanctions on Russia could hurt its business. It is also taking a hit from legislation in Hungary forcing banks to refund customers on the grounds they overcharged. [ID:nL6N0RO1QT] [ID:nB3N0OF00O] Hungary's biggest lender, OTP <OTPB.BU> tracked Raiffeisen, falling 3 percent. Budapest's main stock index <.BUX> wasn't too badly affected, down just two-thirds of a percent. Poland's WIG20 index <.WIG20> fell at the same pace, with lenders PKO BP <PKO.WA>, Unicredit's Pekao SA <PEO.WA> and Commerzbank's mBank <MBK.WA> among the top losers even though Poland's banking sector is regarded as much sounder than Hungary's. A Warsaw-based trader said Belka's comments on monetary easing, which could erode banks' margins, weighed on the stocks. "(The comments) increased the probability of a rate cut in October and these banks could be the most affected, because they have many  deposits with low rates," the trader said.   **  **************** CEE MARKETS SNAPSHOT AT 1227 CET ************   ************************* CURRENCIES ************************* Latest  Previous   Daily   Change   bid close  change  in 2014   Czech crown <EURCZK=>   27.51527.510   -0.02%  -0.67%   Hungary forint  <EURHUF=>  310.850   312.380   +0.49%  -4.47%   Polish zloty<EURPLN=>4.178 4.179   +0.03%  -0.67%   Romanian leu<EURRON=>4.402 4.402   -0.01%  +1.32%   Croatian kuna   <EURHRK=>7.625 7.625   -0.01%  -0.09%   Serbian dinar   <EURRSD=>  118.440   118.445   +0.00%  -3.33%   Note: daily change calculated from previous close at 1800 CET   **************************** STOCKS ************************** Latest   Previous  Daily   Changeclose change  in 2014   Prague  <.PX>981.51   993.97   -1.25%  -0.55%   Budapest<.BUX> 18401.90 18522.77   -0.65%  +0.37%   Warsaw  <.WIG20>2499.05  2515.79   -0.67%  +3.94%   Bucharest   <.BETI> 7207.58  7237.26   -0.41% +11.26%   Ljubljana   <.SBITOP>838.30   839.28   -0.12% +30.78%   Zagreb  <.CRBEX>1919.01  1912.97   +0.32%  +7.79%   Belgrade<.BELEX15>   647.91   642.24   +0.88% +17.46%   Sofia   <.SOFIX> 545.25   547.28   -0.37% +10.96%   ***************************** BONDS ************************** YieldYieldSpread Daily  (bid)change   vs Bundchange in   Czech Republic  spread2-year   <CZ2YT=RR>   0.140-0.028   +020bps-3bps5-year   <CZ5YT=RR>   0.398-0.003   +020bps+0bps   10-year   <CZ10YT=RR>  1.157-0.017   +015bps-1bps  Hungary   3-year   <HU3YT=RR>   3.230+0.020   +326bps+2bps5-year   <HU5YT=RR>   3.710+0.000   +352bps+0bps   10-year   <HU10YT=RR>  4.720+0.020   +371bps+3bps  Poland 2-year   <PL2YT=RR>   2.000-0.066   +206bps-7bps  5-year   <PL5YT=RR>   2.379+0.011   +218bps+1bps 10-year   <PL10YT=RR>  3.057-0.031   +205bps-2bps******************* FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS ******************
