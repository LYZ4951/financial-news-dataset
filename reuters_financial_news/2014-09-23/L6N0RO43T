LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> is set to lose London-based European head of spot foreign exchange trading Mitesh Parikh, its second high-profile forex operative to leave this year, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The departure of Parikh follows that of New York-based Steven Cho, its global head of G-10 spot and forward trading, in February. Parikh, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2002, according to the Financial Conduct Authority register of approved persons, could not be reached immediately for comment.
