FRANKFURT, Sept 23 (Reuters) - German prosecutors have asked a Munich court to press charges against Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> co-Chief Executive Juergen Fitschen and several former executives of the lender in connection with the long-running bankruptcy case of Kirch media group.

Munich prosecutors have been investigating whether Fitschen and a number of former executives gave misleading evidence during a civil court case brought by the heirs of Leo Kirch, the deceased media magnate who had sued Deutsche Bank. [ID:nL6N0LP2YE] "The chamber now has to decide whether the case is admissible," a spokeswoman for the Munich court said on Tuesday. The court must decide whether to accept the case and whether to press charges, a process which is expected to take several months. Fitschen left a Berlin conference on Tuesday without commenting and Deutsche Bank said it was sticking with its policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation.
