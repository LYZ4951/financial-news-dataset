ST. LOUIS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Rising competition from larger lenders and regulatory pressure is hurting small banks across the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank official said on Tuesday.

Fed board member Jerome Powell said the central bank is committed to making sure the Fed understands the challenges faced by community banks. He added that he will conduct a nationwide webinar with community bankers next month.
