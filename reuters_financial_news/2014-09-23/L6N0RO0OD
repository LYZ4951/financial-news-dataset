VIENNA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International's <RBIV.VI> profit warning for 2014 will likely have an impact on results this year at Raiffeisenlandesbank Lower Austria-Vienna AG [RHNDWR.UL], it said on Tuesday.

RBI had warned late on Monday it expected a loss this year given hits from Ukraine and Hungary. [ID:nL6N0RN4TG] Regional landesbank Raiffeisenlandesbank Lower Austria-Vienna is the biggest single shareholder in RBI's unlisted parent Raiffeisen Zentralbank [RZB.UL]. It is also one of six Austrian banks undergoing a review of their balance sheets before the European Central Bank takes on direct supervision of big euro zone banks in November. "Given this change in outlook from RBI a negative impact is expected on 2014 annual results after minorities (IFRS) at  Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederoesterreich-Wien AG," it said in a regulatory release.
