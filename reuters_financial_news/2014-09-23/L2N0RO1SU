WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - A unit of Barclays <BARC.L> will pay $15 million to settle charges alleging it failed to maintain an adequate internal compliance system after its acquisition of part of Lehman Brothers during the 2008 financial crisis, U.S. regulators said Tuesday.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Barclays Capital will also be required to undertake certain remedial steps, including hiring an independent compliance consultant.
