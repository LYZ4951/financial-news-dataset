COPENHAGEN, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Denmark's budget deficit will exceed European Union limits next year following weaker than expected growth in 2014, but growth will pick up during the next two years, the country's central bank said on Tuesday. [ID:nL6N0RO1RX).

Analysts made the following comments:  STEEN BOCIAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DANSKE BANK "The downgrade is a consequence of lower growth than expected in the second quarter." "What's more interesting is that they maintain their fundamental optimistic view on growth for 2015 and 2016, indicating that they think the upturn is here to stay." "They are of the opinion that there is not much economic leeway, and you therefore have to discuss a fiscal tightening to avoid problems in the future."  PETER JAKOBSEN, ECONOMIST, SYDBANK "The question is how serious it will be if Denmark only exceeds the EU's limit for one year. Will that be enough for the EU to once again request Denmark to reduce the public deficit?" "The central bank wags its finger at the government to make sure that the government doesn't implement a more expansive  fiscal policy for 2015 than the one it has suggested in its budget proposal, as it is an election year."
