YEREVAN, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Armenia's central bank kept its key refinancing rate unchanged at 6.75 percent on Tuesday after data showed annual inflation was within the government's 2014 target.

Annual inflation was 0.8 percent in August, the central bank said, up from 0.4 percent recorded in July. That is within the government's target range of between 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent for 2014. Monthly inflation in August was 0.7 percent, compared to deflation of 0.9 percent in July.
