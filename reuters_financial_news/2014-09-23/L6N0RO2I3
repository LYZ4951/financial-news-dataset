LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> could launch a second sale of shares in TSB Banking Group <TSB.L> after a lock-up period expires, according to banking sources.

Investment banks have been making informal pitches to Lloyds for a mandate to sell the shares, and with TSB entering a "black-out" period ahead of its Oct. 24 third-quarter results the offer could come as soon as this week, one source said, cautioning that there was no certainty of the timing of a sale.  Lloyds in June sold a 35 percent stake in TSB, Britain's seventh largest lender, at 260 pence, valuing the business at 1.3 billion pounds. The initial public offering (IPO) was 11 times oversubscribed by potential investors.
