FRANKFURT, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank recently surprised markets by cutting interest rates to close to zero and launching a new programme to stoke lending to try to revive the economy.

Following are highlights of ECB policymakers' comments since the bank's Sept. 4 meeting. To read full stories, click on the links in brackets.  MARIO DRAGHI (PRESIDENT), SEPT 22 He said the euro zone central bank's Governing Council "remains fully determined to counter risks to the medium-term outlook for inflation". "Therefore, we stand ready to use additional unconventional instruments within our mandate, and alter the size and/or the composition of our unconventional interventions should it become necessary to further address risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation."  "As I have indicated now at several occasions, no monetary - and also no fiscal - stimulus can ever have a meaningful effect without such structural reforms." [ID:nL6N0RN34K]PETER PRAET (BELGIUM), SEPT 22  "It would be much better to speak with one voice than what we have today so I'm very much personally in favour of a single euro area constituency in the IMF."[ID: nL6N0RN2H0]  PRAET, SEPT 19 "We weren't suggesting governments to reinsure the whole market for mezzanine tranches, but to target SMEs lending." "The amounts are not that important, considering also that existing facilities, which in some cases are not even used, can be tapped." "What is happening in the currency market is in line with fundamentals. The U.S. has recovered more strongly and we have weak conditions here." [ID:nL6N0RK1IR]  PRAET, SEPT 11 "There is a risk that worsening short-term expectations will influence long-term expectations, especially if inflation continues to undershoot." "Since the summer there have been some signs of a risk of a  possible de-anchoring of inflationary expectations." [ID:nL5N0RC173]  BENOIT COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER), SEPT 21: "Persistent weakness of demand has been a key issue in the discussions. But it was also very clearly recognise that supply-side reforms are necessary to strengthen growth." "We're all aware that the room has become very limited to further stimulate demand through macroeconomic policies. Central banks in advanced economies, including the ECB, are already pursuing very accommodative monetary policies. As regards to fiscal policies, we must all aim at putting our public debt on a downward path, on a sustainable path." "I also stressed the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate if necessary to address the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation, but I also made it clear that monetary support will have very limited effect without progress in structural reforms." [ID:nG20HIGH]  CHRISTIAN NOYER (FRANCE), SEPT 11 "We succeeded perfectly in what was one of our aims, which we need in order to get back to our inflation target of 2 percent a year: we needed to bring the euro down and we still need to bring the euro down." [ID:nL5N0RC0TU]  YVES MERSCH (EXECUTIVE BOARD), SEPT 10 On programmes to buy asset-backed securities and covered bonds: "They are neither comparable with a broad programme of quantitative easing, nor do they represent the overtures to that." [ID:nL5N0RB4GD]  BENOIT COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD), SEPT 10 "The euro area faces risks to its economic growth on such a scale that it's necessary to use all available tools to support the economy." [ID:nF9N0OS012]  ERKKI LIIKANEN (FINLAND), SEPT 9 "Looking at the information that we have seen during the summer, we can well argue for these decisions. One could have even expected this. I never say how I voted, but I am satisfied with the decision." [ID:nL5N0RA1RS]  BENOIT COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD), SEPT 9 "One should note here that when the ECB says it does not have any exchange rate goal (because it mainly has an inflation goal) that clearly does not stop it from taking developments in the exchange rate into account in its analysis and actions. All things being equal, a stronger euro justifies a more accommodating monetary policy." [ID:nL5N0RA0WF]  VITOR CONSTANCIO (VICE PRESIDENT), SEPT 8 "In July at the press conference, (ECB) President (Mario) Draghi said that we are not excluding a priori any instrument that we see as legal and within our remit." [ID:nL5N0R94XB]  EWALD NOWOTNY (AUSTRIA), SEPT 8 On the possibility of quantitative easing (QE): "We have to be careful that we are not getting ahead of ourselves. I think we should focus on what we have decided." [ID:nF9N0N0023]  IGNAZIO VISCO (ITALY), SEPT 7 "As the launch of a new programme of covered bond purchases shows, we must not hesitate to take other actions, if they are necessary to guarantee monetary stability." [ID:nL5N0R80JH]  PETER PRAET (EXECUTIVE BOARD), SEPT 5 On the four-year loan and asset-backed security programme: "The ECB aims for an easing impact that is more certain and less dependent on the borrowing behaviour of banks... What is clear here is that there is a commitment to have a sizeable easing impact." [ID:nF9N0OS00W]  EWALD NOWOTNY (AUSTRIA), SEPT 4
