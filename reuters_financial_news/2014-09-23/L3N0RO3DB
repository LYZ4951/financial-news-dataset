MUMBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - L Capital, Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] and International Finance Corp are in advanced talks to buy a 30 percent stake in the retail arm of India's Aditya Birla Group for about $400-500 million, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Aditya Birla Group will use the funds to expand its retail operations, the sources also said, declining to be named as the talks are still private.
