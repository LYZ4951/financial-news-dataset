DUBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Burgan Bank <BURG.KW> has attracted orders in excess of $650 million for its Tier 1 capital-boosting bond issue, which should price later on Tuesday, according to the lead managers.

The lender has kept price guidance unchanged in the low to mid-7 percent area on Tuesday morning, the level indicated on Monday, the document showed. The bond with a perpetual tenor can be bought back by the lender after the fifth year, and will be benchmark-sized, traditionally understood to mean upwards of $500 million.
