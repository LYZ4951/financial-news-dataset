BUCHAREST, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Romanian restitution fund Fondul Proprietatea <FP.BX> will start buying back roughly 7.3 percent of its shares as soon as the European Union state's financial regulator approves a previous programme, its Franklin Templeton manager said on Tuesday.

The 3.4 billion euros ($4.38 billion) fund, created to compensate Romanians whose assets were seized when the country was under communist rule, holds minority stakes in a slew of state-owned companies. It has been buying back its shares in a bid to narrow the discount between its net asset value and its stock price, which currently stands at roughly 26 percent.  Fondul manager Grzegorz Konieczny said a new programme could start as soon as the financial regulator (ASF) approves the results of its previous plan.
