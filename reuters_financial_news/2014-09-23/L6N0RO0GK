DUBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Qatar's Masraf Al Rayan <MARK.QA> has put its planned acquisition of a stake in a commercial bank in Libya on hold until political conditions in the north African country improve, it said in a statement.

The second-largest sharia-compliant lender by assets in the Gulf Arab state had said in January 2013 that it was looking to buy a strategic stake in a Libyan commercial bank, although it did not name the acquisition target. However, in a bourse filing on Tuesday, Masraf said it had put the deal on hold "until further notice, or till positive indications in the field of investment in Libya are evidenced."
