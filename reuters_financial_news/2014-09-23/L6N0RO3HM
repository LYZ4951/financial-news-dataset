LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Iceland's finance minister said on Tuesday the country could make progress this year towards lifting capital controls imposed after the island's 2008 financial crisis, but work would need to  continue in 2015.

Iceland hired international advisors earlier this year to work on removing the controls introduced after the country's three biggest banks collapsed with massive debts in 2008, sending the economy and the Icelandic crown into a tailspin. "This keeps me optimistic that serious steps can be made still this year," Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson told "Will the work continue next year? Yes, most definitely, it will continue into next year, but progress is being made as we speak. "In as far as we will steadily, step by step, be able to lift controls, I will deem it successful. It is not a date issue, it is a matter of reaching more than one goal at the same time," he said. Iceland, a north Atlantic island of 320,000, has previously said it cannot remove the controls until a deal is concluded with creditors of the old banks - Kauthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki - which had debts of $75 billion.  Creditors had claims against the banks earlier this year of 7,530 billion Icelandic crowns ($63.12 billion), far in excess of Iceland's 2013 economic output of 1,786 billion crowns. Some analysts say time running out before lifting capital controls becomes more difficult. It had a current account surplus last year and the interest rate premium it has over many other developed economies is likely to narrow, they say. Icelandic officials have said previous plans for paying the creditors had not gone far enough in reducing the risk of destabilising the economy and the currency.
