VIENNA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Immofinanz <IMFI.VI>, an Austrian property company focussed on Eastern Europe and Russia, said it planned to reduce financing costs in 2014/15 as it confirmed a first-quarter net loss of 14 million euros ($18 million).

Immofinanz plans to repay a 150 million euro loan that it had collateralised with some of its own shares and a 260 million loan it had used to help Buwog <BWOA.VI>, its spin-off focussed on Austria and Germany, to make asset purchases. "That will lead to a substantial reduction in financing costs," Chief Executive Eduard Zehetner said in a statement on Tuesday. Immofinanz plans to repay both loans by end-April 2015 when its financial year ends. It reiterated that the dividend for 2014/15 should range between 0.15 and 0.20 euros. Zehetner said Immofinanz had seen small rent reductions since the first quarter, having temporarily granted more favourable terms to some of its Russian clients, whose costs had gone up due to the weakness of the rouble <RUB=>.

It added that it expected its value to increase in the current financial year based in part on increased development activities with a focus on Germany, Poland, Russia and Romania.
