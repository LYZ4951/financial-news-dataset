RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank announced on Tuesday it will intensify its intervention in the foreign exchange market after the real closed weaker than 2.4 per dollar for the first time in seven months.

The bank said in a statement it will offer on Wednesday as many as 15,000 currency swap contracts - derivatives that emulate the sale of dollars in the futures market - to roll over similar contracts maturing on Oct. 1.
