STOCKHOLM, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Swedish online fashion retailers will continue to lose market share at home to rapidly expanding foreign competitors such as Germany's Zalando <ZALG.F>, industry insiders told Reuters.

Most of Sweden's bricks-and-mortar clothing firms also boast their own online stores, but the wide range of products and ever-shorter delivery times from abroad combine to limit the growth of domestic sales over the internet. And even though both physical and online stores are expected to see growth in the time ahead, the latter will expand more slowly than before, the Swedish Trade Federation (STF) said. In the second quarter, domestic online sales of clothes and shoes grew by two percent year on year, the slowest rate in almost four years, according to data from the STF and logistics firm Post Nord, and below the country's overall three percent rate of growth for such merchandise. Meanwhile, Berlin-based Zalando and others have expanded on the Swedish market, and on the overall e-commerce market, 27 percent of packages delivered in Sweden now come from foreign vendors, the STF said. "Nobody knows how these companies are doing in Sweden because nobody can measure it. But we can assume that Zalando has a strong position in Sweden," chairman of the STF's fashion branch Mikael Sandstrom said. "I think clothing sales will level off somewhere - I don't know where. But it (growth) is not going to be as fast." Online success depends on keeping a high profile, combined with an acute sense of fashion trends and on-time deliveries, STF analyst Carin Blom said. "When it comes to internet trading, consumers are used to shopping abroad, and clothes make up the absolute biggest share of what we consume in other countries," she added.  "PRETTY COOL" Fashion retailer RNB <RNBS.ST>, owner of the Polarn O. Pyret children's line among others, has chosen to be restrictive on free frights and returning rights, in contrast to many international sites. "We are holding it back. We don't want to get into a war like that because then it will be extremely difficult to make online trading profitable," Chief Financial Officer Stefan Danieli said. Sticking mainly to its own distinct brands online, rather than offering a wider range, has helped the company protect its niche, he added. "But I'm sure there is indirect competition here," Danieli said. Meanwhile, Swedish retailers also look for opportunities to expand their online presence abroad to counter potential erosion at home. E-commerce firm CDON <CDON.ST>, the owner of online fashion store Nelly.com which has half its sales outside of Sweden, said the fact that the market is turning more international should be regarded more as an opportunity than a threat. CDON spokesman Fredrik Bengtsson said the market had become more crowded but added demand remained strong for the company's products. "We have noticed that there are more players in the market, but we grew by over 20 percent in the second quarter and we are seeing strong demand for our goods," he said. Meanwhile, Sweden's overall online shopping is expected to grow by 15 percent to 42.5 billion Swedish crowns this year, according to STF estimates, corresponding to about six percent of overall retail sales. During the last 22 years, Swedish retail sales have grown by an average of 2.8 percent per year, ranging from a peak of 12.2 percent year-on-year growth in April of 2006 to a record low of minus 8.7 percent in December 1992. Sandstrom of the trade federation said he believes Swedish clothing retailers will boost their online presence in the coming years, while internet trading firms are likely to open traditional stores. Meanwhile, Zalando, which was founded six years ago and eked out its first-ever profit in the second quarter, has around 2 billion euros in annual revenues, while its British competitor Asos <ASOS.L> has reached about half as much. The company is expected to complete a stock market listing by October 1. [ID:nL6N0RO2CC] "We are the fastest growing company in Europe. That's pretty cool actually," Zalando Chief Executive Robert Gentz last week told investors at a conference hosted by top owner Kinnevik <KINVb.ST>.
