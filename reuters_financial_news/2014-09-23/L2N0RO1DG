NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Kim Ruth, a former Bank of America executive who was briefly Southwest region executive of Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, has joined Bank of Texas in a newly created role as chairman of its expanded Houston region.

Ruth joined Merrill in February 2014, to oversee thousands of brokers in California, Hawaii and Southwestern states as part of a shakeup of sales management by Merrill wealth head John Thiel. A longtime commercial banker at Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, which is Merrill's parent, she was the only one of Merrill's 11 regional executives without direct retail brokerage experience. [ID:nL2N0M70YC] Her tenure, which required her to move to Los Angeles from Houston, was short. In May, Ruth took a leave of absence from the brokerage, a Merrill spokeswoman said at the time. [ID: nL1N0NY1LV] She was replaced as Southwest region executive by Ben Prince, a former complex director in San Francisco. Ruth, who rose to Texas state president during a more than 20-year career at Bank of America, will oversee Bank of Texas' banking operations in central and southern Texas and also expand its wealth management and mortgage operations, according to a news release from BOK Financial Corp <BOKF.O>, the Texas bank's Oklahoma-based parent.  Ruth did not return a call for comment.
