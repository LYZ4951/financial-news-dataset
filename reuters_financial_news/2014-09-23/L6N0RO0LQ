DUBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Burgan Bank <BURG.KW> has set final guidance for its benchmark Tier 1 capital-boosting bond in the 7.25 to 7.375 percent range on Tuesday, and is expected to price the deal later in the day, according to lead managers.

The bond was initially marked on Monday in the low/mid seven percent area via HSBC <HSBA.L> as global coordinator and Citi <C.N>, JP Morgan <JPM.N> and National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> as lead managers. The bond has a perpetual tenor, but can be bought back by the lender after the fifth year.
