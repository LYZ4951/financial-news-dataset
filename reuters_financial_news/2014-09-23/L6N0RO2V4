TALLINN, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Euro zone member Estonia's economy will grow faster than previously forecast in 2014 after the statistics office revised its calculation method for economic activity, the central bank said on Tuesday.

The central bank raised its forecast for growth in 2014 to 2.1 percent from the 0.7 percent seen in June [ID:L5N0OS1V8], but lowered its forecast for 2015 to 2.5 percent from a previous estimate of 3.9 percent growth.  It kept its forecast for growth in 2016 at 3.6 percent. In the second quarter, Estonia's economy grew 2.4 percent compared to the same period a year ago, according to revised data from the statistics office.
