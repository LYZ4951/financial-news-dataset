PARIS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - French financial holding company Eurazeo <EURA.PA> said on Tuesday it has around 700 million euros in cash available after its wholly-owned unit Ray Investment sold its remaining 7.13 percent stake in electrical equipment supplier Rexel <RXL.PA>.

The sale of 20.9 million Rexel shares raised around 320 million euros, Eurazeo said in a statement. Eurazeo, which had invested in Rexel in 2012, multiplied its initial investment by nearly 2.3 times during the period, it said.
