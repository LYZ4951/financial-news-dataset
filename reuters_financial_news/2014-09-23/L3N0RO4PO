Sept 23 (Reuters) - Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC [GIC.UL], is in talks to buy the British roadside rescue business RAC Ltd from U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group LP <CG.O> for over 2 billion pounds ($3.28 billion), Sky News reported, citing a person familiar with the talks.

The British broadcaster said the sale to GIC was likely to end an expected share listing of RAC. Sky added that GIC might instead take a large minority stake in RAC before an initial public offering.

[ID:nL3N0ON34A]Sky said, without citing sources, that CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] had also expressed interest in buying RAC. GIC, CVC, RAC and Carlyle were not immediately available for comment.
