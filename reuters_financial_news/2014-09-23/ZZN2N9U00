HONG KONG, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished at their lowest in two months on Tuesday, unimpressed by stronger Chinese mainland markets and weighed down by a few index heavyweights.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> slipped 0.5 percent to 23,837.07 points, the lowest close since July 22. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was off 0.3 percent to its lowest since July 21. Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> slid 1.8 percent to a nearly three-month closing low, hurt by the New York listing of rival Alibaba Group <BABA.N>.  Sands China <1928.HK> dived 3.0 percent and Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> sank 2.5 percent, leading losses among casino operators after a brief rebound last week.
