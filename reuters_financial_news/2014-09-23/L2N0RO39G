Sept 23 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N> has hired investment bank TAP Advisors LLC to plan a sale of its network's assets including its cell towers, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo told Reuters on Sept. 17 that Verizon is open to divesting its network's assets.[ID:nL1N0RI1JC] Verizon was inspired by rival AT&T's <T.N> $4.85 billion sale of some of its towers to tower operator Crown Castle (CCI)[CRCST.UL] last year, Shammo said. A sale or leaseback of the towers similar to AT&T's deal at $500,000 per site could raise $6 billion in liquidity, Macquarie Securities analyst Kevin Smithen wrote in a note.   "We believe there could be multiple bidders for this asset but believe the potential sale of the last sizeable U.S. tower asset could explain why CCI has not announced a capital return strategy to date," Smithen said.
