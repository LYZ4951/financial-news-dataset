NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were modestly lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 on track for its third straight daily decline as investors digested signs of slowing global growth.

The day's losses were slight but broad. All ten primary S&P 500 sectors fell on the day, with consumer staples <.SPLRCS> the weakest on the day, off 0.8 percent. Energy <.SPNY> stocks were the relatively best performers, down less than 0.1 percent as crude oil <CLc1> rose 0.9 percent. Wall Street's losses tracked Europe, which was down after data showed a contraction in French business activity and slower growth in German manufacturing this month. The European data "is a little concerning," said David Lebovitz, global market strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds in New York. "We didn't expect things to improve there forever and always, but we are seeing a bit of a slowdown, which is weighing a bit." The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was falling 80.19 points, or 0.47 percent, to 17,092.49; the S&P 500 <.SPX> was losing 7.69 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,986.6; and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was dropping 11.92 points, or 0.26 percent, to 4,515.77. The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Millennial Media Inc <MM.N>, which was rising 12.99 percent, while the largest percentage decliner was CarMax Inc <KMX.N>, down 10.07 percent. Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, up 0.65 percent to $17.14; U.S. shares of Grupo Aval Acciones Y Valores <AVAL.N>, up 1.11 percent to $13.65 and Rite Aid Corp <RAD.N>, up 3.52 percent to $5.29. On the Nasdaq, Yahoo Inc <YHOO.O> was up 0.4 percent at $38.80, Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, up 1.4 percent at $102.52 and Sirius XM <SIRI.O>, up 0.1 percent at $3.53 were among the most actively traded. Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,039 to 946, for a 2.16-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,742 issues were falling and 880 advancing for a 1.98-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
