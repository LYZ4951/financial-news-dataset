VIENNA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> expects risk costs in Russia to increase in absolute terms next year as the economy struggles, Chief Risk Officer Johann Strobl told reporters on Tuesday.

On other subjects, Chief Executive Karl Sevelda said he had got the message in talks with government officials in Hungary that the worst may be over for banks being forced to compensate customers for what authorities called mispriced loans.
