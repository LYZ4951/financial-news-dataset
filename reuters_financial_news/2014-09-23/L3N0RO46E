Sept 23 (Reuters) - Fitch downgraded its rating on Pennsylvania's general obligation bonds to 'AA-minus' from 'AA', reflecting the U.S. state's inability to address its fiscal challenges.

"The commonwealth's rapid growth in fixed costs, particularly the escalating pension burden, poses a key ongoing challenge," Fitch Ratings said in a statement. Fitch said it expects budgetary planning and management to mitigate the pressures consistent with the 'AA-minus' rating.
