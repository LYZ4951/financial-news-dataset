ISTANBUL, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The head of Air Lease Corp <AL.N> reiterated on Tuesday a warning that aircraft manufacturers may struggle to increase production as fast as they hoped because of strains in the supply chain.

But ALC Chief Executive Steven Udvar-Hazy joined other lessors at a conference on Tuesday in saying that demand for aircraft remained healthy. The head of SMBC Aviation meanwhile said he was interested in expanding the leasing company's portfolio of narrow-body jetliners to include new generation mid-sized wide-body jets.
