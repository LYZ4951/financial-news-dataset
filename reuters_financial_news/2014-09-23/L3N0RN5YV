SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares reversed an early dip to rise 0.3 percent on Tuesday as a better-than-expected manufacturing survey from China showed modest expansion, raising hopes of an economic recovery in Australia's largest export market, though a drop among miners tempered gains.

A preliminary HSBC/Markit Flash China Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 50.5 in September from August's final reading of 50.2. The 50 point level separates growth in activity from contraction.[ID:nS7N0MG03Q] This helped buoy the market, with Australia's largest telecommunications provider Telstra Corporation Ltd <TLS.AX> gaining 1.1 percent, while diversified company Wesfarmers Ltd <WES.AX> added 0.4 percent.  "The PMI data was much stronger than expected, that'll keep the bears (away)- we're seeing a relief rally across most risk assets at the moment," said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst from OptionsXpress.  The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> rose 16.4 points to 5,379.3 by 0204 GMT. The benchmark declined 1.3 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since early August.  Despite the ASX200 losing between 4 percent to 5 percent over the past three weeks, analysts at Morgan Stanley said market fundamentals remain positive with good prospects for a rebound.  The benchmark hit a six-year intraday high of 5,679.5 points on Aug. 21 but has since slumped, erasing most year-to-date gains as investors have exited Australian equities on the back of rising bond yields and a slump in iron ore prices. The benchmark is 0.5 percent for the year.  Chinese steel and iron ore futures slid 4 percent to their lowest on record, plagued by worries about excess supply. Among iron ore miners, top tier stocks BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> lost 0.6 percent and 0.2 percent.  An uptick among stocks with high exposure in the U.S. helped buoy the market as the Australian dollar was trading at $0.8873 <AUD=D4>, hovering near February lows. Pallet maker Brambles Ltd <BXB.AX> jumped 2 percent, while blood products maker CSL Ltd <CSL.AX> gained 0.8 percent.  Companies with large U.S. earnings benefit from a low Aussie when funds are repatriated, boosting bottom lines.  Australia's Nufarm Ltd <NUF.AX> soared 10.7 percent after the company reported a jump of 15 percent in full-year revenue from ordinary activities to A$2.6 billion. [ID:nS9N0QB02G] New Zealand's benchmark NZ50 index <.NZ50> slipped 16.5 points or 0.3 percent to 5,220.88, staying off a record high of 5,264.43 hit earlier in the month. Losses were led by a 3 percent slide in New Zealand Refining <NZR.NZ> to NZ$1.60 ($1.29) after the company said it would have to halt production at the country's only oil refinery next month due to a strike by some staff. [ID:nW9N0PX02K] Kathmandu Ltd <KMD.NZ> stumbled 2.2 percent to NZ$3.08 after the outdoor apparel maker reported a 4.5 percent fall in annual profit due to fluctuating weather and a high exchange rate. [ID:nW9N0PX02I] Power companies also eased as investors booked profits on a relief rally on Monday after a decisive win by country's ruling National party in weekend general elections had removed the prospect of creating a national wholesale electricity buyer proposed by some opposition parties.
