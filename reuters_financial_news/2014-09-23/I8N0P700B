MUMBAI, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Indian shares posted their biggest single-day fall in two-and-a-half months as blue-chips such as ICICI Bank tracked weaker global stocks on disappointment over European manufacturing data and concerns about an unemployment measure in a survey in China.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed down 1.58 percent at 26,775.69 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> also fell 1.58 percent to 8,017.55.
