Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Board of the Central Bank at its meeting today decided to keep interest rates at 4.5% intervention. In this decision, the Board took into account the following considerations:   International oil prices have fallen considerably and are at levels not seen since 2009. This decline reflects increases in supply, lower demand and a stronger dollar. Uncertainty about the future price of this basic commodity is high.   The drop in oil prices and rising international prices of some foods that Colombia imports have generated a deterioration in the country's terms of trade. This negatively affects the growth.  The currencies of several emerging countries continue to depreciate, country risk premiums have gone up and the prices of financial assets have fallen. The exchange rate peso-dollar has risen considerably and showed a strong volatility.   The performance of the world economy remains weak. The U.S. economy continues to recover while the euro area and Japan have low growth. Output growth in key emerging market countries continues to slow or has historically low increases. It is possible that the recovery of our trade partners in 2015 is, on average, weaker than estimated in previous months.   In Colombia, GDP growth in the third quarter of 2014 (4.2%) was lower than expected (4.6%). The results of consumer confidence, retail trade, car sales and consumer credit suggest that domestic demand remains dynamic. Moreover, other indicators on the supply side, such as industry and oil production, are increasing at low annual rates.  Inflation at the end of 2014 will be placed in the upper half of the target range. The deviation from the central point of 3% is temporary and is mainly explained by the correction of transient declines in some past price and temporary increases in others. Core inflation is below 3% and headline inflation is expected to converge at that value.   The depreciation of the peso has in part affected the CPI, excluding food and price-regulated (goods and services). The volatility of the exchange rate and possible corrections could limit level crossing. Additionally, if depreciation moderates, it is to be expected that the transmission continues, but without significant effects on inflation expectations.   In summary, domestic demand continues to show a healthy momentum in the context of near-full utilization of productive capacity. At the same time, inflation and associated expectations are placed slightly above 3%. This occurs in an environment of declining terms of trade, depreciation of the peso and growing uncertainty about recovery in global economic activity and the cost of external financing, factors that may influence future behavior of aggregate demand. After evaluating these risks, the Board considered it appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior and projections of economic activity and inflation in the country, asset markets and the international situation. It reiterates that monetary policy will depend on the information available. Finally, given the levels reached in several indicators of hedging external liquidity as well as recent changes in the exchange market conditions, the Board decided not to continue buying foreign reserves.
