WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Friday said Poland has requested a new two-year flexible credit line, which would replace a $33.8 billion line that expires in January.

The new arrangement, which acts as a credit backstop without strict conditions and targets well-run emerging economies, would be of a smaller amount than the previous line of credit, IMF Deputy Managing Director David Lipton said in a statement.
