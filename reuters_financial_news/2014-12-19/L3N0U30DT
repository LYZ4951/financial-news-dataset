SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 1.8 percent on Friday in a broad-based rally after Wall Street boasted its biggest two-day advance since late 2011 after the Federal Reserve promised patience in the timing of interest rate hikes.

The gains came even as oil stayed under pressure and base metals fell. The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> jumped 92.4 points to 5,303.2 by 0136 GMT, Its biggest single day gain since last December. The benchmark rose 1 percent on Thursday. "There is a general good feeling in the market after the Fed announcement. Probably also coupled with the fact that we are getting into holidays," said Sydney-based Kara Ordway, analyst at City Index. A Reuters poll showed Australia's benchmark share index was set to end 2015 at its highest since May 2008 as risks from weak commodity prices were seen likely to be eclipsed by an improving U.S. economy and hefty inflows from pension funds.
