JAKARTA, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Friday as the U.S. Federal Reserve's pledge to be "patient" about hiking interest rates continued to boost sentiment.

The markets had been highly volatile earlier in the week as plunging oil prices and the Russian rouble caused outflows from the region due to global risk aversion.
