LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Europe's markets regulator suggested that brokers would need to price and supply execution and research services separately in the future.

The recommendation from The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) came as part of its advice to lawmakers drafting the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) regulations.
