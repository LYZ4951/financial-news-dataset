SAO PAULO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - SulAmérica SA <SULA11.SA>, Brazil largest independent insurer, is considering acquisitions in under penetrated sectors for next year as part of a plan to sustain double-digit revenue growth, Chief Executive Officer Gabriel Portella said on Friday.

The São Paulo-based insurer also sees organic growth opportunities in insurance products for small- and mid-sized companies and sales of policy packages for individuals, Portela said in an interview.  With a mix of products linked to household income, such as health and car insurance policies, SulAmérica saw revenue increase by 19 percent in the first nine months. The fastest-growing segments, Portella noted, were retirement and savings-related policies. The plan underscores Portella's effort to cushion SulAmérica from an economy that is in its fourth year of stagnation. Industry-wide revenue is expected to grow 13 percent this year, almost half the 21 percent expansion in 2013, according to estimates by industry group SindSeg. "Our diversification strategy has to do with the fact that we want to weather any potential economic downturn," Portella said.  Acquisitions could help SulAmérica boost revenue, Portella noted, declining to say what sectors the company is eyeing.
