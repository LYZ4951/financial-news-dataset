LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The European markets regulator on Friday proposed tougher rules to deal with payments for third-party investment research.

ESMA said in a statement it wanted the research to be paid for directly by investment firms or from a ring-fenced research account funded by a specific charge to their clients.
