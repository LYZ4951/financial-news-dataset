HANOI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed 1.01 percent lower on Friday in heavy trading as two exchange-traded funds completed their quarterly reviews.

Hanoi-based Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, Vietnam's biggest lender by market value, led the decliners with a 6.91 percent fall, with volumes at a five-year high of 4.9 million shares, Reuters data showed. Top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> dropped 6.97 percent to its lowest close in two years, while food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> fell 1.9 percent to the lowest since February 2011. Market Vectors Vietnam <VNM.P> and db x-trackers FTSE Vietnam <XFVT.DE>, the two major exchange-traded funds (ETF) on the Vietnamese market, had their last review trading sessions on Friday, which analysts said contributed to a 60-percent surge in volume. Both ETFs have Masan and Vietcombank shares in their portfolios, while Market Vectors Vietnam also has Baoviet as of Nov. 30. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT).
