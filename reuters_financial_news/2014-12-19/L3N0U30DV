BANGKOK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Thai Union Frozen Products PCL <TUF.BK>, the world's largest canned tuna producer, said on Friday it has signed an agreement to acquire 100 percent of North American tuna company Bumble Bee Foods for $1.51 billion from a private equity firm.

The deal is part of a plan by Thai Union, the world's largest canned tuna producer, to boost the group's portfolio of seafood products in the United States and Canada, the company said in a statement.  Thai Union said it expected the deal to boost its revenue by about 25 percent and will seek short term loans from domestic financial institutions to finance the acquisition.
