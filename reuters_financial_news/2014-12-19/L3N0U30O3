SHANGHAI, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Anbang Insurance Group Co, the Chinese insurer that has bought New York's famed Waldorf Astoria hotel, has increased its stake in China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd <600016.SS> to become the biggest shareholder of the country's largest private lender.

Anbang has been on a buying spree this year that started with its purchase of the Waldorf in October for $1.95 billion. It now owns about 3.1 billion Minsheng shares, through four different subsidiaries, and controls 10 percent of the bank, Minsheng said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange late Thursday. Anbang held 1.7 billion shares as of November 28, according to an earlier securities filing by Minsheng.
