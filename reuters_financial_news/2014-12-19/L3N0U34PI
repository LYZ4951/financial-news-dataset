Dec 19 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's cut Ukraine's credit rating to "CCC-" with a negative outlook from "CCC", citing concerns over a delay in the release of the next tranche of bailout to the country and over its falling currency reserves.

The International Monetary Fund said it had productive talks with Ukraine officials this week, but the two parties failed to reach an agreement that would pave the way for Kiev to receive its next bailout tranche next month.
