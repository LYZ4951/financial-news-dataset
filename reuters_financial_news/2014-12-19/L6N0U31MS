BELGRADE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank purchased euros on the interbank currency market on Friday to stem the dinar's rally, as the domestic currency rose more than 1 percent in a day, dealers said.

The bank started purchasing euros, the first such move since July 10, as the dinar traded at 121.1, or 1.07 percent stronger than Thursday's close of 122.29 to the euro. The dinar traded at 121.4 at 1025 GMT, according to Reuters data.
