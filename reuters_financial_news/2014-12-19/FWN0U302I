OSLO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Norway's DNB bank <DNB.OL> one of the most exposed lenders to the oil and gas sector, said on Friday that its lending portfolio is healthy and well tested against big oil price movements.

Around 8 percent of the bank's loan book is to the oil and gas sector and the bank said it still expected impairments to stay below normalised levels next year, in line with its previous guidance.
