FRANKFURT, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Banks curbed their repayment of old loans given to them by the European Central Bank on Friday, a week after many took fresh long-term credit at almost zero cost.

The ECB said that seven banks would repay 4.589 billion euros ($5.63 billion) from a first round of emergency loans given at the height of the financial crisis. Ten banks would repay 2.482 billion euros from a second such offer, it said, taking the total repayment to 7.071 billion euros. A Reuters poll had pointed to a total repayment next week of 11.5 billion euros. [ID:nL3N0TZ3J5] The announced repayment total is significantly lower than one week ago when banks repaid almost 40 billion euros. [ID:nL6N0TW1QJ]  The repayment of old loans runs counter to the ECB's efforts to expand its balance sheet by around 1 trillion euros - a target it has set with a view to pumping money into the flagging euro zone economy to foster lending and stimulate activity. Last Thursday, the ECB's second offering of a new round of cheap loans to banks drew only tepid interest, underlining fragile confidence in the euro zone economy and making ECB money-printing to buy sovereign bonds appear all but inevitable.
