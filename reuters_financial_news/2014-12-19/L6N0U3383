LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - London-based hedge fund Old Park Capital's $300 million Maestro Managed Futures Strategy added 0.96 pct in November to take its year to date total to 21.63 percent, a letter to investors seen by Reuters showed.

The strategy makes money by arbitraging differences in price between a number of cash and futures markets created by the extended trading session for futures contracts. "We are now in a sweet spot for Maestro as my view for the coming months is that either the market volatility stabilises at current levels... or it moves at some point to a regime of higher levels," co-founder Bruno Pannetier said in the letter.
