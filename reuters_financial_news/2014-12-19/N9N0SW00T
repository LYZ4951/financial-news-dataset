CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec 19 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will likely raise U.S. interest rates next year, given the strength of the economy, a top Fed official said on Friday.

As long as the Fed remains confident the data is moving toward its 2 percent inflation goals, the Fed needs to set interest rates that reflect a strong U.S. economy, according to Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker. "My belief is that the time will come next year to raise rates," said Lacker, a voting member on the Fed's policy-setting committee next year, speaking at a luncheon panel here.
