HONG KONG, Dec 19 (Reuters) - A former top Hong Kong civil servant was found guilty on Friday of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from the city's largest property developer, Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd <0016.HK>.

Raymond Kwok, co-chairman of the company, was found not guilty of three charges in the graft case.  But his brother and fellow co-chairman, billionaire Thomas Kwok, was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.  The case, involving payments to former chief secretary Rafael Hui, has thrown a spotlight on the cozy relationship between the city's powerful developers and government in the former British colony.
