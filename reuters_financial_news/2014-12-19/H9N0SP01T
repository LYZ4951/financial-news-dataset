HONG KONG, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's de facto central bank said on Friday it had found no evidence of rigging in Hong Kong's foreign exchange benchmark, following an investigation into the trading operations of 10 banks.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it found no evidence of collusion among the banks investigated to fix the Treasury Markets Association FX rates or the FX benchmark fixings of other jurisdictions.
