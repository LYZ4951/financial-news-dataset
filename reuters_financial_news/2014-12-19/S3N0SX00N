STOCKHOLM, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Nordea <NDA.ST>, the Nordic region's biggest bank, said on Friday it is likely to reduce its exposure to Russia over time although its business is strong in the country.

"We have a strong credit quality so our position (in Russia) is very good. However, the Nordic and Baltic countries are our main strategy, so Russia is a bit off," said Rodney Alfven, head of investor relations at Nordea. "It is reasonable to believe that over time we will reduce our exposure to Russia. "
