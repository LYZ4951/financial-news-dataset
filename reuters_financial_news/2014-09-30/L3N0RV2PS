MUMBAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - India's economy is currently positioned to reach central bank's 6 percent inflation target by January 2016, but there is a lot more confidence about reaching a near-term target of 8 percent by January next year, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said after a policy review on Tuesday.

The RBI kept its key policy repo rate <INREPO=ECI> unchanged at 8.0 percent as widely expected, while expressing concerns about risks to its target to bring consumer inflation down to 6 percent by January 2016. [ID:nBAYUKEA34]
