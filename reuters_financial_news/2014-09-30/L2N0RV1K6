NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - British wealth manager St. James's Place has replaced Pimco as the manager of its Multi Asset fund, less than a week after the resignation of Pimco's Chief Investment Officer, Bill Gross, roiled global fixed income markets.

The Multi Asset fund will now be run by three new investment managers, St. James's Place said in a statement on Monday, including teams from Invesco Perpetual, Schroders and U.S.-based Payden & Rygel. Pimco manages a total of £944 million ($1.5 billion) for St. James's Place in a multi asset strategy, split among life, pension, unit trust and international funds. The switch from Pimco will take effect on Nov. 10, according to the statement. A spokeswoman for St. James said the company decided to shift its funds away from Pimco before the resignation of Gross on Friday.  Bill Gross, the bond market's most renowned investor, quit Pimco for distant rival Janus Capital Group Inc<JNS.N>, the day before he was expected to be fired from the huge investment firm he co-founded more than 40 years ago.[ID:nL2N0RR0PM]
