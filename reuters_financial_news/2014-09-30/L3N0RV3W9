BANGKOK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets ended mostly lower on Tuesday amid weaknesses in Asian stocks and political unrest in Hong Kong, but late buying in PTT <PTT.BK> after gas price hikes helped the Thai index recoup early losses.

Thailand's military-backed government said it will raise prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for transportation and natural gas for vehicles (NGV) from Oct. 1, as part of its energy reforms. [ID:nL3N0RV38C] PTT said it expected losses incurred from its NGV business would reduce by 2 billion baht ($61.7 million) per year after the NGV price hike of 1 baht/kg to 11.50 baht, sending its stock 1.98 percent higher, the biggest one-day gain in four weeks. The SET index <.SETI> ended nearly flat, rebounding from an intraday low of 1,581.17. The benchmark rose 6.7 percent in the July-September period, its third straight quarterly gain and was the best performer in Southeast Asia. Asian markets were in a hesitant mood on Tuesday as investors wondered what China's response would be to civil unrest in Hong Kong. [MKTS/GLOB] Investors also looked forward to the European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday to gauge the direction of fund flows to the region, according to brokers. [ID:nL3N0RU3Y0] Most Southeast Asian stocks notched up gains for the three months ended September. The Philippines <.PSI> rose 6.4 percent, Indonesia <.JKSE> put on 5.3 percent, Vietnam <.VNI> 3.6 percent and Singapore <.FTSTI> 0.7 percent. Malaysia <.KLSE> bucked the trend, falling 1.9 percent.
