BUCHAREST, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Romanian restitution fund Fondul Proprietatea <FP.BX> will start a fourth buy-back programme of about 7 percent of its issued shares on Oct. 1, it said on Tuesday.

The 3.4 billion euros ($4.29 billion) fund, created to compensate Romanians whose assets were seized under communism, holds minority stakes in a slew of state-owned companies, some of which are unlisted. It has been buying back its shares in a bid to narrow the discount between its net asset value and its share price, which currently stands at roughly 26 percent. The programme should cost at least 198.2 million lei ($56.76 million).
