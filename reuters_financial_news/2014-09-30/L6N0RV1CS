PARIS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - European stocks inched higher in early trading on Tuesday, halting a recent slide, with shares of Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> rising after the UK lender cut provisions for bad loans.

RBS stock surged 3.9 percent after the group said it would  release 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) from provisions it had set aside to cover losses on bad loans after an improvement in the economy, especially in Ireland. [ID:nL6N0RV0OL] Shares in the auto sector lost ground, with Daimler <DAIGn.DE> down 1.1 percent and Renault <RENA.PA> down 2.4 percent, as traders cited a warning from U.S. carmaker Ford <F.N> about its outlook that sent its shares down 8 percent on Monday. [ID:nL2N0RU2C2] At 0738 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,373.05 points, taking a breather after a 3.4 percent slide in the past seven sessions. "There is still a lot of hesitation. We're getting some bearish signals such as a rise in volatility and a drop in shares of financial institutions. There's just no direction at this point, but I remain cautious," said Jean-Louis Cussac, head of Perceval Finance, in Paris. The Euro STOXX 50 Volatility index <.V2TX> has surged in the past two weeks, signaling a rise in risk aversion. The higher the index - used to measure the cost of protecting stock holdings against market corrections as it usually moves in the opposite direction to cash equities - the lower investor appetite for risky assets such as stocks. Gains in equities on Tuesday were capped as China's final HSBC/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hovered at 50.2 in September, unchanged from the August reading which was a three-month low, but lower than a preliminary reading of 50.5.

[ID:nL3N0RV1I0] On the macro front, investors awaited September inflation data for the euro zone, seeking cues on the prospect for European Central Bank to step up its efforts to stave off deflation risks. Around Europe, UK's FTSE 100 index <.FTSE> was down 0.1 percent, Germany's DAX index <.GDAXI> up 0.05 percent, and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> up 0.5 percent. Next <NXT.L> featured among the top losers, down 3.2 percent after Britain's second biggest clothing retailer said it would  have to lower its full-year profit forecast if the country's unusually warm autumn weather continues.
