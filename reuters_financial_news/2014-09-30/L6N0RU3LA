LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - European investors sharply increased their exposure to stocks in September, betting the region's companies will get a lift from looser monetary policy aimed at reviving economic growth, a Reuters poll showed.

According to a monthly survey of 18 Europe-based asset managers, the average allocation to equities in balanced portfolios was 48.6 percent in September, up nearly three percentage points from 45.7 percent a month earlier. The rise came largely at the expense of bond allocations, which dropped to 35.8 percent from 37.6 percent.  Exposure to property also dropped, to 0.6 percent from 1.7 percent. Cash was unchanged at 7.7 percent. "Equities, particularly outside the United States, are still fairly valued. Second, monetary policy overall continues to be accommodative, in spite of some policy divergence over the coming months and years. Third, the OECD (developed) economies remain in expansion, led by the US," said Boris Willems, a strategist at UBS Global Asset Management. Expectations are rising that the European Central Bank, faced with stubbornly slow economic growth, will start printing money through a programme of government bond purchases, known as quantitative easing (QE). It has already cut interest rates to close to zero. Such stimulus usually increases revenues and profits at companies, which in turn should benefit share prices. Some members of the poll sample highlighted the resolution of issues that had been causing them to hold back on stocks - such as Scotland's voting against separation from Britain on September 18 and the U.S. Federal Reserve's reiterating rates would stay ultra-low for a "considerable time". "We decided early this week to add some more equities as the (Fed) did not bring any real new news and after the Scottish 'No'," said Steven Steyaert, a portfolio specialist at ING Investment Management. Allocations in bond portfolios have moved in different directions. Assumptions are widespread that monetary policy will diverge across the developed world, with Europe poised to start bond purchases after the U.S. ends its own QE. The average allocation to the U.S. and Canada in global bond portfolios dropped in September to 17 percent from 22.3 percent a month earlier. Exposure to the euro zone rose to 60.4 percent from 56.1 percent.
