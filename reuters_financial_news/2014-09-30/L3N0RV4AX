KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Malaysia's AMMB Holdings <AMMB.KL> said it would sell its entire stake in PT AmCapital Indonesia for 83.7 billion rupiah ($6.9 million) to Taiwan-based broker Yuanta Securities <2885.TW>.

AMMB's disposal of the wholly owned unit, which it considers as a non-core asset, is conditional on approval from regulators in Indonesia and Taiwan, the company said in an announcement to the stock exchange on Tuesday.
