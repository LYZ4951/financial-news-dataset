Sept 30 (Reuters) - An affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management <BAMa.TO> <BAM.N> has topped Florida real estate developer Glenn Straub's $90 million bid for the bankrupt Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.

The auction started on Wednesday with Straub's all-cash bid, but was adjourned until Tuesday for the Jewish Rosh Hashanah holiday. [ID:nL2N0RP2PI] Brookfield, which owns the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Las Vegas, could not immediately be reached for comment.  If Straub loses the auction, he will collect a $3 million breakup fee for serving as the lead bidder, the newspaper said. (http://on.wsj.com/1vtHPml) Straub said on Monday that he would challenge the results if he lost the auction because the process lacked transparency. [ID:nL2N0RU2NU] Other bidders could include real estate developer Richard Meruelo, who expressed an interest in buying Revel Casino in a bankruptcy court last week, the WSJ said.
