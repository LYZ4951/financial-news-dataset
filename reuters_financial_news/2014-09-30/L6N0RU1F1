BUCHAREST, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Consolidation in Europe's banking sector is unavoidable and could partly be triggered by the current asset quality review (AQR) of European lenders, Raiffeisen Bank Romania CEO Steven van Groningen told Reuters on Tuesday.

Van Groningen said at the Reuters Eastern Europe Investment Summit that Raiffeisen could look at taking over a smaller local lender if the price was right and it presented good value, but such a decision would ultimately be up to the bank's shareholders.  The European Central Bank is examining whether about 130 of the euro zone's top banks have properly valued their assets and have enough capital to withstand future crises, seeking to banish doubts about their health six years on from the global credit crunch. Results of the exercise will not be finalised until October. "Consolidation is unavoidable anyway in my view," Van Groningen said. "If I simply look at Romania, is kind of difficult to see why would we need 40 banks and ... and with the ambition to be universal banks," he said in the Reuters office in Bucharest. "I don't think that's realistic, that's not cost efficient, especially with the steadily increasing costs in terms of system compliance, capital, etcetera."
