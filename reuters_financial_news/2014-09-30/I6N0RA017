MILAN, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> said on Tuesday it had extended exclusive talks with private U.S. equity fund Apollo Management over the sale of its two insurance units until Oct. 15.

Carige said the extension had been granted at Apollo's request given the "positive" negotiating process. Carige, one of 15 Italian lenders targeted by a sector review across the euro zone this year, is shedding assets and cutting loans in an effort to strengthen its capital base after posting a 1.76 billion euro loss last year in a balance-sheet clean-up.
