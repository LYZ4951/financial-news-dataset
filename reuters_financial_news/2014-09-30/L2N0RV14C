TORONTO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP [ERNY.UL] agreed on Tuesday to an C$8 million ($7.2 million) voluntary payment with Canada's biggest securities regulator over its audits of Sino-Forest Corp [SCLC.UL] and another China-focused company.

Ernst & Young, which has already paid C$119 million to settle the civil lawsuits, did not admit to any wrongdoing in the no-contest settlement. All parties have agreed to the deal, which was approved by the Ontario Securities Commission. Sino-Forest had been listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and at one point was valued at more than C$6 billion ($5.47 billion). But after a short-seller in 2011 alleged the company had exaggerated its assets, its shares tanked and were later delisted.
