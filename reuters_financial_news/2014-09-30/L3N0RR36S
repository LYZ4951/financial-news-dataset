HONG KONG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> led underwriting rankings in Asia Pacific ex-Japan equity capital markets (ECM) in the first nine months of 2014, preliminary data released by Thomson Reuters showed. ECM deal volumes rose 20.4 percent from the same period in 2013 to $146.8 billion, according to the data.

Proceeds from initial public offerings led the ECM expansion, surging 80 percent to $40.2 billion on increased activity in Hong Kong and Australia and as new listings resumed in China after a hiatus of more than one year. Following is a list of the region's top ECM underwriters in the first nine months of the year and the estimated fees earned on deals.
