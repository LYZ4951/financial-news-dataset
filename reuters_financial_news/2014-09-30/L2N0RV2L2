SAO PAULO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Global bond offerings by Brazil's government and companies jumped 49 percent in the first nine months, as the U.S. Federal Reserve's ultra-loose monetary policy was seen staying in place for longer than first thought, a Thomson Reuters dealmaking report showed on Tuesday.

According to the quarterly report, Brazil's federal and sub-national governments and companies sold a total $54.99 billion worth of debt in the year through Sept. 30. About 154 offerings were recorded during the period, up from 78 a year earlier. Local investment banks continued to dominate Brazilian sovereign and corporate debt underwriting, capturing the lion's share of a 29 percent surge in fees, the report showed. The top three underwriters were Brazilian-based banks, while the largest 10 underwriters handled eight in every 10 deals in the period. Banco do Brasil SA <BBAS3.SA>, the state-run lender that is the country's largest bank by assets, led Brazil debt underwriting advisory rankings this year, the report showed. The Brasilia-based lender advised on 29 debt offerings worth $8.33 billion, clinching a 15.2 percent market share, the report showed. "This could be the best year ever for Brazilian global bond deals," Aguinaldo Barbieri, Banco do Brasil's managing director for fixed income, said in an interview. "The delay in the (Fed interest rate) tapering is helping flows, along with rate decisions in Europe and geopolitical tension that also helped bolster demand for Brazil assets." Itaú BBA, the wholesale and investment banking unit of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA>, ranked No. 1 in terms of number of deals after helping underwrite 46 bond offerings worth $5.18 billion in the year through September.  Demand for emerging market debt may start to dissipate as some developed economies raise borrowing costs to fight inflation. With issuers in Brazil being forced to raise yields to lure investors, some economists have warned that higher U.S. rates could hurt growth in the emerging market world.  BRIGHT SPOT Banco Bradesco SA <BBDC4.SA> ranked second in global debt underwriting for Brazilian issuers as measured by value and number of deals. The bank participated in 39 transactions totaling $6.55 billion, the report showed. Debt capital markets activity, known more commonly among bankers as DCM, has become a bright spot in a grim year marked by the slowest activity in Brazilian equity markets since at least 2004 and a decline in the number of announced mergers and acquisitions deals. Brazilian companies, which for years relied on a dynamic local equity market for new cash, are beginning to tap debt markets for purposes other than refinancing debt or funding investment.
