BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China will relax mortgage rules for second-home buyers to shore up its cooling housing market, the central bank and the banking regulator said in a joint statement on Tuesday, taking one of the biggest steps this year to lift slackening economic growth.

With the changes, second-home buyers can now get a 30 percent discount on their mortgage rates, a privilege previously limited only to first-home buyers. Downpayment levels would also be cut to 30 percent from 60 percent to 70 percent.
