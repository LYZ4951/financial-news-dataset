TOKYO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Corp <9984.T> has been in talks to take a minority stake in privately held movie studio Legendary Pictures, entertainment trade publication The Hollywood Reporter reported on Tuesday.

The talks between SoftBank and Burbank, California-based Legendary, home of hits like "Man of Steel" and the 2014 remake of "Godzilla", have been going on for weeks, according to the publication. The talks have been on a separate track from SoftBank's negotiations with DreamWorks Animation<DWA.O>, The Hollywood Reporter said.  The Hollywood Reporter was first to report that SoftBank had been in talks with DreamWorks over a possible acquisition. A SoftBank source and banking sources in Japan subsequently said those talks had cooled even before media reports about them emerged over the weekend. [ID:nL3N0RV1Y4] SoftBank declined to comment.  Legendary was founded in 2000 by chief executive Thomas Tull, who raised funding from private equity investors. A representative of Legendary could not be reached for comment.
