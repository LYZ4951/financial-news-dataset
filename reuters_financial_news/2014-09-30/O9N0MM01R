OSLO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Currency markets should get used to Norges Bank buying Norwegian crowns, the head of the central bank told Reuters, after the bank made its first purchase of Norwegian crowns to cover the government's non-oil budget deficit on Tuesday.

"I hope and believe that they (the markets) will get used to this, they way they got used to the daily purchases of currency (in the past)," Oeystein Olsen said in an interview after delivering a speech.
