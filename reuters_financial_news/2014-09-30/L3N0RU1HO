SINGAPORE/HONG KONG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The value of announced M&A deals involving Asia Pacific companies excluding Japan so far this year rose 53.3 percent year-on-year to $552.6 billion, the strongest period for the region since records began in 1980, preliminary data released by Thomson Reuters showed.

The volume of China's outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A), however, fell for the first time in three years as state-owned firms turned cautious in the wake of a slowing economy and President Xi Jinping's crackdown against corruption.
