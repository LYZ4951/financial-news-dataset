WARSAW, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Poland's biggest bank PKO BP <PKO.WA> could issue eurobonds worth at least 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) next year, it said on Tuesday.

"We're not planning to enter the eurobond market in 2014," it said in a statement. "Potential issues will be possible next year, when we can tap the eurobond market with at least 1 billion euros potentially, assuming that market conditions are favourable and subject to long term liquidity needs." In January, the state-run bank sold 5-year bonds worth 500 million euros with a spread of 115 basis points over mid-swaps.  Under PKO's current euro-denominated bonds programme, it can sell up to 3 billion euros worth of debt, as it aims to diversify sources of financing.
