WARSAW, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Liquidity problems at Bulgaria's Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> are an isolated issue in an otherwise decently capitalised banking system, Standard & Poor's rating analyst Kai Stukenbrock said.

However, Stukenbrock, a senior director at S&P responsible for areas including central and eastern Europe, also said Bulgaria was in need of a new growth model to get richer. It is the European Union's poorest member state.  A run on deposits at Corpbank in June prompted the Bulgarian central bank to seize control of the country's fourth-largest lender and freeze its operations, leaving customers unable to access their accounts. [ID:nR5N0P600B] "We think this is an idiosyncratic problem of that particular bank and of the bank's setup," Stukenbrock told Reuters in comments authorised for release on Tuesday. "We think it is not a systemic issue in the financial system. Capitalisation and prudential ratios in the system remain at decent levels." The bank also failed to make the final payment on a $150 million bond that matured in August, prompting threats of legal action. Corpbank's problems are unlikely to be addressed until a new government can be formed after an Oct. 5 general election. [ID:nL6N0RO1VR] Stukenbrock also said that continued deleveraging in Bulgaria's banking sector was weighing on growth. The problem was also a lack of high-quality demand for loans, the analyst said. "The underlying problem that Bulgaria faces is that it has not found a new growth model," Stukenbrock said. "Before the crisis it was real estate construction that drove the economy. That model collapsed with the crisis. Now there is not really a new idea, model or approach. To some extent this explains the relatively low growth that we have."
