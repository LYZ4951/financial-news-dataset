DUBAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - National Bank of Oman <NBO.OM> has launched a $500 million, five-year bond offer at the tight end of its final guidance, with the deal to complete later on Tuesday, a document from  lead managers showed.

The sultanate's second-largest lender by assets will borrow at 135 basis points over mid-swaps, at the lower end of final guidance of 140 bps plus or minus 5 bps. It had set initial price thoughts in the mid-100s area on Monday. Investor orders top $1.2 billion for the issue.
