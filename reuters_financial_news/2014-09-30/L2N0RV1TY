WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A former Deloitte analyst and a consultant who roomed with a Pershing Square Management research analyst were charged Tuesday with insider trading, after they learned that Pershing's manager Bill Ackman was taking a short position in Herbalife [HERBA.UL], U.S. regulators said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Filip Szymik of New York learned that Ackman planned to bet against Herbalife with a $1 billion short position from his roommate, who worked at Pershing.  He then tipped Jordan Peixoto, of Toronto, who bought Herbalife put options a day before Ackman's announcement and reaped more than $47,000 in profits.
