HONG KONG, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index fell to a three-month low on Tuesday, finishing on its biggest monthly fall since May 2012 as investors dumped shares amid the city's worst civil unrest in decades.

Investor apprehension at how Beijing might respond next has deepened as tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters  blocked streets in Hong Kong's busiest areas, in one of the biggest political challenges to Beijing since the Tiananmen Square crackdown 25 years ago.
