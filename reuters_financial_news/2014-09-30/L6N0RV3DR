Sept 30 (Reuters) - Bank credit growth in Qatar rebounded to 9.0 percent in August from 7.1 percent in the previous month, which was the lowest level since at least 2006, central bank data showed on Tuesday.

Money supply (M2) growth accelerated to a five-month high of 13.5 percent year-on-year at the end of August from 8.8 percent in the previous month.  Non-resident deposits fell 8.2 percent on an annual basis, marking a year of consecutive declines, but rose 5.2 percent month-on-month to 33.7 billion riyals ($9.3 billion).
