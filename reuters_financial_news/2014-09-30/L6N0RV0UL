DUBAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Doha's Ahli Bank <AABQ.QA> has signed a $200 million three-year loan with a group of 11 lenders, Qatar's eighth-largest bank by assets said on Tuesday, with the funds to be used for its general business needs.

The loan, which initially targeted to raise $100 million but was increased in size following interest from participating banks, will pay an interest rate of 120 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), a filing to the Qatar stock exchange said.
