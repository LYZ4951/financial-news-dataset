DETROIT, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The last major objector to Detroit's landmark bankruptcy plan is zeroing in on a settlement, according to reports late on Monday by the city's two local newspapers, which both cited unnamed sources.

Bond insurer Financial Guaranty Insurance Co (FGIC) has been negotiating a settlement that would include a cash payment, control of a parking garage, and city-owned real estate, in a deal that would closely mirror the city's settlement with another creditor and bond insurer, Syncora Guarantee Inc., according to the Detroit News. Since the Syncora deal was announced earlier this month, the city has said FGIC would be eligible to "opt in" for a similar settlement, but has only publicly discussed the financial recovery elements of Syncora's deal. Syncora, which has a $400 million exposure in the case, is set to receive $44.8 million through the issuance of two types of notes, along with a credit of around $6 million toward purchasing property. That has secured Syncora a 13 percent recovery on its claim involving Detroit's $1.4 billion of pension debt, said Gaurav Malhotra, an Ernst & Young consultant who has worked on Detroit's historic bankruptcy, while testifying on the city's plan to restructure debt and obligations on Monday. Malhotra added that $123 million remains in a fund to offer FGIC a similar recovery on its $1.1 billion exposure also from insuring the pension debt. But Syncora's recovery will likely be far richer because of real estate transactions included in the settlement. The insurance company will control a major downtown parking lot and take home its operating profits, receive an extended lease of the Detroit side of a tunnel connecting the city to Canada, and can acquire six empty lots at no cost. It also will receive $5 million in cash. Malhotra said that the real estate part of the deal had not been valued when questioned by Weil, Gotshal & Manges attorney Edward Soto, representing FGIC.  A FGIC spokesman declined to comment on the reports. A spokesman for Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
