LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - ICAP <IAP.L>, the world's largest interdealer broker, said on Tuesday that said first-half revenue was expected to be 10 percent lower than a year earlier as low levels of volatility kept trading volumes suppressed.

The London-based company, which matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and other tradeable instruments, also announced that finance director Iain Torrens is to leave the group for telecommunications firm TalkTalk <TALK.L>. ICAP will report its first-half results in full on Nov. 19.
