DUBAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - National Bank of Oman <NBO.OM> has set final guidance for its  five-year U.S. dollar benchmark bond which is expected to price later on Tuesday, a document from lead managers said.

The sultanate's second-largest lender by assets is earmarked to price its deal at 140 basis points, plus or minus 5 bps, over midswaps. It had set initial price thoughts at the mid-100s over midswaps on Monday. [ID:nL6N0RU0RR] Investor orders top $1.2 billion for the issue, the document showed. Benchmark size is traditionally understood to mean upwards of $500 million.
