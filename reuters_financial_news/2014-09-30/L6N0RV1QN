BUDAPEST, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Hungary's banks are likely to compete strongly to offer forint loans when customers' foreign currency loans are converted next year, which could accelerate mergers and acquisitions in the sector, a senior central banker said.

Central bank Managing Director Marton Nagy told the Reuters Eastern Europe Investment Summit on Tuesday that banks with sufficient capital and liquidity could poach clients from rivals when the toxic loans worth 9 to 10 billion euros are converted. "This will be a watershed moment, and banks will generate intense competition ... because they can acquire portfolios in the process," Nagy said in an interview. He also said more lenders could leave Hungary after BayernLB's sale of its MKB unit, with only 5 large banks remaining. All the major foreign banks operating in Hungary have said they would stay. Parliament passed a law last week that will force banks to compensate their clients for past charges on loans that courts and the government found unfair - many of them mortgages taken out in Swiss francs or euros at a time when exchange rates and interest rates were much more favourable to Hungarian borrowers. Compensation is expected to cost banks about 1 trillion forints ($4 billion), or 700 to 800 billion in net terms after various deductions, Nagy said. As a next step, the remaining stock of foreign currency mortgages and home equity loans will be converted into forints some time in the first quarter or first half of 2015. "Competition is needed to ensure that interest rates on the loans do not rise as a result of the conversion," Nagy said. He said under new legislation being drafted by the government, new forint loans for households could carry a fixed interest rate level for 3 or 5 years, or a fixed spread over the Budapest interbank rate. Nagy said for fixed rate loans to be competitive, banks should issue mortgage notes to secure long-term funding and some lenders may even launch mortgage units as the market expands. "The question is whether it is possible to draw up a system of regulation and incentives for banks to foster growth in the mortgage note market so that banks ... can offer competitive long-term fixed interest rates to clients," he said. He added that a bad bank to be launched next month would buy up non-performing real estate loans from banks below book value, causing further potential losses to the heavily-taxed sector.
