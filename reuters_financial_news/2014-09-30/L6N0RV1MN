LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a new two-year low against the dollar, while European shares and German Bunds rose on Tuesday after data showed euro zone annual inflation at 0.3 percent in September <ECONEZ>.

The euro <EUR=> fell as low as $1.2627 from $1.2661 before the data. This helped drive the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, to a four-year high. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was up 0.4 percent at 1,376.33 points, while Bund futures <FGBLc1> erased their earlier losses and were up 1 tick at 149.53.
