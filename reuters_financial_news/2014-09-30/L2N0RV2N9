SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's upcoming sale of $900 million tax revenue anticipation notes (TRANS) will be placed privately with a syndicate of banks, the chairman of Puerto Rico's Senate Finance Committee Jose Nadal Power said on Tuesday.

"It's a pretty routine transaction. The problem is that we usually pay 1 percent to 2 percent in financing and this time it will cost from 5 percent to 8 percent," Power said.
