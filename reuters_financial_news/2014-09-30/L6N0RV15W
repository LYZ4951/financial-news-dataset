LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> said its performance in the third quarter continued to reflect concern among clients about geopolitical instability, coupled with a traditional summer slowdown.

Tom Naratil, UBS's chief finance officer, declined to give specific guidance on the bank's performance in the third quarter but said it "will reflect the environment indicated in the outlook statement in Q2 results".
