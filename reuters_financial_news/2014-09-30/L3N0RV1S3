MANILA, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Medium-sized Philippine lender Rizal Commercial Banking Corp <RCB.PS> said it decided to defer a 4.5-billion peso ($100.38 million) stock rights offering because of a potential private placement by Taiwan's Cathay Financial Holding Co Ltd <2882.TW>.

"RCBC is in the process of negotiating the transaction documents with Cathay Financial for the proposed transaction," the lender told the local stock exchange, adding that both sides agreed to negotiate until Dec. 31. [ID:nL3N0RV17I]
