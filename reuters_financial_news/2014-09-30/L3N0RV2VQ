MUMBAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - India's central bank kept its key policy repo rate <INREPO=ECI> unchanged at 8.0 percent on Tuesday, as widely expected, while warning of risks to its target to bring consumer inflation down to 6 percent by January 2016.

"This continues to warrant policy preparedness to contain pressures if the risks materialise," the Reserve Bank of India said in a statement following the policy review. "Therefore, the future policy stance will be influenced by the Reserve Bank's projections of inflation relative to the medium term objective (6 percent by January 2016), while being contingent on incoming data."   -- Timeline for repo  [ID:nL3N0RV2VK] -- Timeline for reverse repo  [ID:nL3N0RV2VM]  -- Timeline for CRR   [ID:nL3N0RV2VJ]Here is a timeline on changes in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) since 1949.
