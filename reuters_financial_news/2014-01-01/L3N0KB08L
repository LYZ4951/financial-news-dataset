COLOMBO, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee ended a tad firmer on Wednesday as banks sold dollars expecting at least a 50-basis-points cut in the central bank's key policy rates amid a fall in treasury bill yields, dealers said.

The market expects the central bank to cut its key  policy rates to multi-year lows on Thursday to stimulate economic growth. The spot rupee <LKR=> closed at 130.65/75 per dollar, slightly firmer from Tuesday's close of 130.75/90. "There was forward selling by banks ahead of the rate announcement, expecting at least 50-basis-points cut (in the key policy rates)," a currency dealer said on condition of anonymity. Yields on treasury bills fell to their lowest since Nov. 11, 2011 at a weekly auction on Wednesday and dealers said the reduction also added pressure on the rupee forward premiums.  Dealers said the three-month forward premium fell by 30 cents while six-month and one-year forward premiums dropped by around 50 cents and 20 cents respectively.   Dealers expect the currency to appreciate in the first quarter of 2014 due to a possible dollar bond inflow, before falling due to lower interest rates pressurising the exchange rate amid a pick-up in importer dollar demand.
