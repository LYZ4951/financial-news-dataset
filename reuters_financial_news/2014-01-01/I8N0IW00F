MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India has granted qualified central counterparty status to Clearing Corp of India Ltd (CCIL) on Wednesday which will allow banks to eliminate various counterparty exposure risks.

While the CCIL was already guaranteeing transactions in government securities and collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO), from now on, it will also be able to guarantee the dollar/rupee trades, interest rate derivatives and forward rate agreements.
