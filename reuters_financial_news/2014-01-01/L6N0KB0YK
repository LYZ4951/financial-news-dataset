FRANKFURT, Jan 1 (Reuters) - IKEA Group [IKEA.UL], the world's biggest furniture retailer, expects to nearly double its market share in Germany in the next eight to 10 years thanks to new stores and growing online sales, the head of its German business told a newspaper.

"We have a market share of 13 percent in Germany. Twenty-five percent is realistic," Handelsblatt daily quoted Peter Betzel as saying in an excerpt of an article to be published on Thursday.
