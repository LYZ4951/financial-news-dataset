YANCHENG, March 26 (Reuters) - The governor of China's Sheyang county urged depositors not to panic and said bank deposits were protected after solvency rumours sparked a run on at least two local banks, according to a video posted on the county government's website on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people rushed to withdraw money from branches of two small Chinese banks after rumours spread about solvency at one of them, reflecting growing anxiety among investors as regulators signal greater tolerance for credit defaults.
