HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Group Corp [CITIC.UL] plans to list in Hong Kong through a backdoor deal with its Citic Pacific <0267.HK> unit, IFR reported on Wednesday, citing a source familiar with the plans.

Citic Pacific plans to issue new shares to fund its purchase of around $40 billion of assets from its parent in a reverse merger, said IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.  Shares of Citic Pacific have been suspended since Monday at the request of the company pending an announcement, the company said in a regulatory filing at the time.  Citic Securities International, the group's Hong Kong-based brokerage and investment banking unit <600030.SS>, will act as financial adviser on the deal, IFR said.
