JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Reuters) - South African mass-market lender Capitec Bank Holdings <CPIJ.J> reported a sharp slowdown in full-year profit growth on Wednesday, with earnings rising 16 percent on widening bad-loan costs.

Capitec, which offers high-interest loans to low-income South Africans, has enjoyed years of explosive growth due to ravenous demand for credit in Africa's largest economy. But lacklustre economic growth and high unemployment have hit debt-burdened South Africans hard, hammering some of Capitec's mass-market rivals, including African Bank Investments <ABLJ.J>. "This year has seen deterioration in the quality of our loan book," Capitec said in a statement. Diluted headline earnings totalled 1,740 cents in the year to end-February, from 1,498 cents a year earlier, when Capitec enjoyed 36 percent profit growth. Net interest income - the measure of earnings from lending - increased by about a third, as did bad loan costs.
