March 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says today Chinese homebuilder Sunac's <1918.HK> healthier financial position and more sophisticated product positioning have strengthened its credit profile, as reflected by the company's sound results for 2013. While there is no immediate upward pressure, if Sunac  can proof its resilience in the lower-growth market in 2014, there may be  positive rating momentum. Sunac's leverage is healthier with net debt/net inventory adjusted for  structural subordination at 37% at end 2013, down from 43% a year earlier,  mainly because of its strong growth in sales and more conservative financial  management. The improved leverage, together with the slightly slower growth in  sales target of around 28% in 2014 (compared with 54% actual growth in 2013),  signals that Sunac is transforming from a company pursuing pure growth of  business to one also focusing on quality of management and financial positions.
