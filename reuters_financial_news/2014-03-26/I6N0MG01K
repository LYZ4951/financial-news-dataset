MILAN/LONDON March 26 (Reuters) - Unicredit <CRDI.MI> is set to launch a new hybrid dollar-denominated bond on Thursday, after completing a road show in Asia and Europe, shrugging off concerns about higher volatility amid tensions in Ukraine, sources close to the deal said.

The perpetual Additional Tier 1 bond is likely to yield more than 7 percent, according to the sources. Italy's biggest bank by assets will use the issuance to boost its capital base.
