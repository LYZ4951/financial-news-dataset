SEOUL, March 26 (Reuters) - Seoul shares notched their biggest one-day gain in more than a month on Wednesday as investors were cheered by encouraging U.S. economic data and by hopes China will introduce policies to stem lagging growth in the world's second-biggest economy.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 1.2 percent at 1,964.31 points, marking its biggest daily advance since Feb. 21. Earlier in the session, the index reached its highest intraday level since March 10.
