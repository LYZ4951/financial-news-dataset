SAO PAULO, March 26 (Reuters) - Underwritten premiums at Allianz SE's <ALVG.DE> South America global corporate and specialty reinsurance unit could more than triple to $400 million this year, in a sign Europe's largest insurer is expanding despite intense competition and the slow take-off of large-scale investment projects in some countries, an executive said in an interview.

Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty Re could earn about half of that amount from Brazil, with the remainder from contracts in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina, vice president Guilherme Perondi said late on Tuesday. The unit is close to starting up operations in Chile, he added. Last year, revenue from premiums at the unit was about 254 million reais ($115 million), of which 98 percent stemmed from business deals in Brazil. Growth in the unit's seven business lines - property, liability, engineering, financial lines, special risks, aviation risks and transportation - is likely to come from organic growth, Perondi said. Rapid growth in demand for reinsurance and high-risk corporate insurance coverage in Latin America's largest economy allowed the unit to rank among Brazil's top-five underwriters in the segment. Underwritten premiums rose 36.5 percent to 4.8 billion reais in Brazil last year.  In the rest of South America, demand for reinsurance is growing amid record investment projects in Colombia, he said. Outstanding capital for the unit, at about 145 million reais, will be enough to expand operations in the region for another three years, he noted. According to Perondi, growth for Allianz came even after infrastructure projects from factories and airports to mines and shipbuilding sites in Brazil got off to a late start, and the government auctioned rights to operate roads, railways and ports a year later than expected.  Rates that primary insurers pay reinsurers to help them shoulder risks for clients are too low at the moment, and as claims from catastrophes around the world fell last year, competition is intensifying in Brazil, the executive added.  "Local dynamics are being affected by the external situation," he said. "Competition in Brazil's reinsurance and corporate insurance markets will be intense for years." Despite that, Allianz will count on its expertise and ability to structure difficult reinsurance transactions to win new business, Perondi said, adding that the company's policy to protect profitability prevent executives from lowering policy prices.
