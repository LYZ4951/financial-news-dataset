VIENNA, March 26 (Reuters) - Austrian property group Conwert <CONW.VI> proposed paying a 10 cent per share dividend on 2013 results, half of what it had said last March was likely.

"In light of the group profit a dividend of 0.10 euro per share will be proposed to shareholders at the next ordinary annual general meeting on May 7, 2014. This translates into 8.3 million euros ($11.44 million) based on the current number of shares outstanding," it said in a statement late on Tuesday.
