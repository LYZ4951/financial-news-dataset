ATHENS, March 26 (Reuters) - Piraeus Bank <BOPr.AT>, Greece's second-largest lender by assets, priced its 1.75 billion-euro equity offering at 1.70 euros a share, at a small discount to the share's price on Wednesday, an executive at the bank told Reuters.

Proceeds from the bank's share offering, without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders, will plug a 425 million euro capital shortfall a stress test by the central bank revealed earlier this month and pay back 750 million euros of preferred shares owned by the state.
