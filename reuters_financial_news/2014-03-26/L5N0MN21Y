CAIRO, March 26 (Reuters) - The Egyptian central bank sold $38.3 million to banks at a foreign currency auction on Wednesday, with a cut-off price of 6.9525 pounds to the dollar, weaker than the 6.9501 price at the last auction on Monday. <CBOE>

The pound has been under pressure during three years of political turmoil. Egypt's foreign currency reserves stood at about $17.3 billion pounds in February, down from $36 billion before the uprising that led to President Hosni Mubarak's overthrow in 2011.
