ATHENS, March 26 (Reuters) - Greece's second-biggest refiner Motor Oil <MORr.AT> is likely to report on Wednesday that 2013 profits were almost eradicated by low refining margins, high crude costs in the Mediterranean and a six-week scheduled maintenance shutdown, analysts said.

The company is expected to post a 93-percent drop in profit to 5.2 million euros ($7.2 million), compared with 78.2 million euros in 2012, according to the average estimate of five analysts polled by Reuters. Adjusting for changes in the company's oil inventories, Motor Oil is expected to report operating profit (EBITDA) of 232.9 million euros, 23 percent lower than in the previous year. Motor Oil shares have risen 16 percent since the start of the year, slightly outperforming a 14-percent rise in the Athens bourse's general stock index <.ATG>. The company's share is trading at 9.9 times estimated 2014 earnings, compared with 20.5 at Hellenic Petroleum <HEPr.AT>, according to Thomson Reuters data.
