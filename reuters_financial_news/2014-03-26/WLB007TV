LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog has fined Santander UK <SAN.MC> 12.4 million pounds ($20.5 million) for "serious failings" in the way it offered financial advice two years ago.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday there was a "significant risk" that the British arm of Spanish bank Santander gave unsuitable advice to customers and its approach to investors' risk appetites was inadequate.
