COLOMBO, March 26 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee ended steady on Wednesday despite importer dollar demand as dealers were reluctant to trade above 130.70 levels due to moral suasion by the central bank.

Dealers said banks were asked to keep the currency at the 130.70 per dollar level through moral suasion, a measure used by the central bank to keep the rupee volatility at low. The spot rupee <LKR=> ended flat at 130.70/75 per dollar. "Nobody traded above 130.70, though there was import demand," said a currency dealer. Central Bank officials were not immediately available for comments. Dealers said the forward market was active and the three-day forward, or spot next, ended at 130.78/84 per dollar, weaker than Tuesday's close of 130.72/75. The local currency has been largely on the rise ahead of the traditional new year, contrary to market expectations. The rupee usually falls in March and early April due to higher import demand ahead of the Sinhala-Tamil new year.  Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said last week the rupee would be stable throughout this year due to increasing inflows from exports and remittances into the island nation. [ID:nL3N0MG1HF] Dealers said lack of credit demand for imports will help reduce downward pressure on the rupee. The currency gained 0.25 percent in the 20 sessions through Wednesday, Thomson Reuters data showed. It has fallen 0.08 percent so far this year.
