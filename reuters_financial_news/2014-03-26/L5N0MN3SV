MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's ratings services revised down its outlook on St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya on Wednesday to "negative" from "stable", reflecting that U.S. sanctions imposed on the bank could have a negative effect on its business.

The rating agency said it was also suspending its rating as the sanctions "preclude us from maintaining a rating on the bank".
