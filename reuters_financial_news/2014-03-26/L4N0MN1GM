HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to fall below 6 percent by the end of this year, James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Wednesday.

Bullard, speaking on a panel at the annual Credit Suisse investor conference in Hong Kong, also said the U.S. economy is set for a "pretty good year" despite recent weaker data.
