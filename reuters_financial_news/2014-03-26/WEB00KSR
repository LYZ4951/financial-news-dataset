ZURICH, March 26 (Reuters) - The Swiss government has appointed former UBS <UBSN.VX> banker Mark Branson as head of financial regulator FINMA, the regulator said on Wednesday.

The 45-year-old Briton is the first non-Swiss national to head the Swiss regulator and has raised eyebrows in Bern due to his past at Zurich-based UBS. [ID:nL5N0MM4PB]
