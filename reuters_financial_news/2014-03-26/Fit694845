March 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed China Fishery Group Limited's <CNFG.SI> (China Fishery) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and its senior unsecured rating at 'BB-'. The outlook remains negative. The USD300m senior unsecured notes issued by CFG Investment S.A.C. [CFGPE.UL] and guaranteed by China Fishery have also been affirmed at 'BB-'. The affirmation follows an improvement of China Fishery's business profile after  its acquisition of Copeinca ASA <COPE.OL> (Copeinca, 'B+'/Stable) making it the leading  anchovy fishmeal producer in Peru. Its recovery of the prepayments for the  long-term supply agreement (LSA) in Russia has also addressed the risk of  suffering substantial losses in this investment in the event of negative  regulatory influence on its contract supply business. Risk to its operations remains as the full repayment of the LSA prepayment will  only conclude by April 2016. China Fishery's fleet performance has also been  erratic since it started operating in 2011. Finally, the outlook can be  stabilised only after the company has deleveraged and achieved  an adjusted net  debt/EBITDAR of below 3.0x.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Strengthened Business Profile: Fitch estimated that the Peruvian fishmeal  segment will be contributing close to 80% of China Fishery's EBITDA after the  termination of the LSA. The is because the contract supply business will become  a spot purchase business with very thin trading margins and this segment used to  contribute about 65% of China Fishery's EBITDA. Although the change reduces  China Fishery's earnings diversity, it can lessen the uncertainty posed by  regulatory changes that may result in substantial losses in this operation. The  refocus of China Fishery's operations to Peru is also a positive given the firm  demand for fishmeal, which is a staple needed for aquaculture globally. This is evident in the strong price increases of Peruvian fishmeal and fish oil  as a result of significantly lower total allowable catch (TAC) for Peru  anchovies for the fishing season starting in November 2012. Prices of Peruvian  fishmeal at end-March hit a record USD2,200 per metric ton compared with between  USD1,200 and USD1,600 in 2012. As a result China Fishery's H113 EBITDAR margin  rose to 45% versus 40% for 2012. For the financial year ending 28 September 2013  (FY13), China Fishery's Peruvian fishmeal segment (excluding Copeinca) only saw  a 5% yoy decline in EBITDA versus a 25% drop in revenue. Leverage Remains High: Fitch expects China Fishery's leverage to exceed 3.0x in  FY14 and FY15 following its Copeinca acquisition and the termination of the LSA  prepayments. Pro-forma FY13 leverage including Copeinca full-year contribution  would have been 4.1x. Following the LSA termination, China Fishery's FY14  leverage may be reduced to below 3.5x (net debt offset by the outstanding LSA  repayment) if management persists with deleveraging. China Fishery's ability to  generate positive free cash flow of about USD90m from FY15 can help the company  reduce its leverage to below 3.0x by FY16.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - adjusted net debt/EBITDAR is sustained above 3x even with the full repayment  of the LSA prepayments - the China Fishery fleet operation continues to show volatile performances and  suffer losses - any issues arising to obstruct the full repayment of the LSA prepayments
