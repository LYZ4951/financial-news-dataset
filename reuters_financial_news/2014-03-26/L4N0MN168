HANOI, March 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> dipped 0.31 percent at the break on Wednesday as individual investors sold stocks to reduce margin trading, an analyst said.

Retail investors have borrowed huge funds from brokerage firms for investment in shares, given the index's strong growth in recent months, analysts said. The Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Southeast Asia's best performer in 2013, has risen nearly a fifth since the beginning of this year, Reuters data showed. Securities companies with a registered capital of less than 300 billion dong ($14 million) have now reached a high margin lending ratio, said analyst Nguyen The Minh at Viet Capital Securities. Banking sector led the losses, with Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, Vietnam's largest listed bank, falling 1.58 percent and Sacombank <STB.HM> dropping 2.37 percent.
