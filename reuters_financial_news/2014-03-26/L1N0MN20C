MEXICO CITY, March 26 (Reuters) - Mexico's Senate on Thursday agreed to set up a special commission to investigate Oceanografia, the oil-services company at the center of an alleged fraud that forced Citigroup Inc <C.N> to trim its 2013 profit.

Details about the commission's start date and who may be called for questions have not been confirmed, a senate spokesman said. Citigroup said last month it uncovered $400 million in bogus loans to Oceanografia at its Mexican subsidiary, Banamex.
