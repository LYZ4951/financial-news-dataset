March 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A(idn)' Long-Term National Rating on four Indonesian regional development banks - PT Bank Pembangunan Daerah Riau and Kepri [RIAUK.UL] (Bank Riau Kepri), PT Bank Pembangunan Daerah Lampung (Bank Lampung), PT Bank Pembangunan Daerah Maluku [MALUK.UL] (Bank Maluku) and PT Bank Sulut [BPSUL.UL] (Bank Sulut). The Outlook is Stable. At the same time, Fitch has assigned a National Short-Term Rating of 'F1(idn)' to Bank Riau  Kepri, Bank Lampung and Bank Sulut. A full rating breakdown is provided at the  end of the commentary. 'A' Long-Term National Ratings denote expectations of low default risk relative  to other issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in  circumstances or economic conditions may affect the capacity for timely  repayment to a greater degree than is the case for financial commitments denoted  by a higher rated category.  'F1' Short-Term National Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating. Bank Riau Kepri, Bank Lampung, Bank Maluku and Bank Sulut are majority-owned by  the provincial governments, municipalities and regencies within their provinces.  The affirmation of the National Long-Term Ratings reflects unchanged support  from the regional and central governments. The central government may provide  limited support to these four regional banks, if required, given their important  policy role in supporting the development of their regional economies, and in  spite of their lower systemic risk compared with other large banks in Indonesia.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The National Ratings of Bank Lampung, Bank Maluku and Bank Sulut reflect Fitch's  view that all of those regional governments have a propensity to support the  banks, if needed, given their majority ownership of these banks. This is in  addition to potential, but limited, support from the central government given  the banks' important role in the development of their regions. While Bank Riau  Kepri is a relatively smaller bank (0.5% of system assets), its National Rating  reflects its sizeable low-cost deposit base, satisfactory capital position,  average profitability and modest asset quality.  These regional banks act as treasurers for their respective regional  governments, and are the main lenders to their region's civil governments. The  central government showed its support through capital injections into 12 such  banks, including these four, during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - NATIONAL RATINGS Downward rating pressure may arise from a weakening of the central government's  ability and/or propensity to provide extraordinary financial support to such  regional development banks. However, Fitch believes this to be a remote prospect  in the near to medium term. Deterioration in the banks' standalone financial  profiles is unlikely to impact their National Ratings, given the regional  governments' majority ownership in and potential support to these banks. Upside potential for the banks' National Ratings may arise if they can  successfully close the gap with its larger Indonesian peers in terms of the size  of operations and assets, while maintaining a sound asset quality record, high  core capitalisation and healthy profitability with a predominantly low-cost  funding base. An upgrade of the Indonesian sovereign rating may also potentially  impact the banks' ratings.   RATING SENSITIVITIES- DEBT RATINGS The ratings of the banks' rupiah-denominated senior bonds and medium-term notes  are the same as their National Long-Term Ratings. This is because these debts  constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations of the  concerned entities and rank equally with all their other unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations. Any changes in the National Long-Term Ratings would  also affect these issue ratings.   The list of rating actions follows: Bank Riau Kepri National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A(idn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating assigned at 'F1(idn)' Rupiah Senior Bond 2011 affirmed at 'A(idn)'  Bank Lampung National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A (idn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating assigned at 'F1(idn)' Rupiah Senior Bond 2012 affirmed at 'A(idn)'   Bank Maluku National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A(idn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1(idn)'  Rupiah Senior Bond 2011 affirmed at 'A(idn)'  Bank Sulut National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A(idn)'; Outlook Stable
