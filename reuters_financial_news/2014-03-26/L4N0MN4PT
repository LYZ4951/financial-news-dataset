SYDNEY, March 27 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open lower on Thursday, following losses on Wall Street as investors fretted about tougher sanctions being implemented on Russia, while a dip in copper and gold prices may hurt resource stocks.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> dropped 0.6 percent to 5,337, an 39.8-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close on Wednesday. The benchmark rose 0.8 percent in the last session. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.3 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, led by losses in the technology and materials sectors, as geopolitical concerns rose after the United States and the European Union agreed to work together on tougher sanctions on Russia. * Copper retreated on Wednesday from the two-week high hit in the previous session, but the outlook for metals demand remained supported by prospects that China will stimulate its economy. Gold fell to near $1,300 an ounce.  * Spot iron ore rose more than 1 percent as Chinese buyers, encouraged by firmer steel prices, picked up cargoes and helped the raw material recover further from a sharp fall earlier this month.
