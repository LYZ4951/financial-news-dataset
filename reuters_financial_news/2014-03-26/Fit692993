March 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that it believes that the Nigerian insurance market is ripe for further consolidation as insurers seek to increase scale and investor interest develops.  Fitch expects foreign investors seeking an entry point to the market to continue  to do so through acquisitions of existing insurers, or partnerships with local  banks. Thorough due diligence will remain a challenge to the acquisition of  existing insurers, despite improvements in corporate governance. Fitch believes that consolidation in the industry, combined with technological  improvements in administration and distribution, could lead to a reduction in  operational costs. Insurers that succeed in reducing costs could rapidly gain  market share by passing on most of the benefits to consumers.  The insurance industry is poised to benefit from continued significant economic  growth and favourable demographic factors in Nigeria. Moreover, insurance  coverage is currently low with a weak insurance culture among consumers and  market growth could be stimulated by improved consumer awareness and enforcement  of minimum compulsory insurance cover as required by law.
