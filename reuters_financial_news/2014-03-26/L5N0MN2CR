COPENHAGEN, March 26 (Reuters) - Danish financial services firm Nykredit [FRNYKR.UL] said on Wednesday it would cut 7.5 percent of its workforce as it aims to reduce costs.

"The staff reduction is regrettable but nessessary. We have a goal to reduce our costs by 0.5 billion Danish crowns ($92.3 million) by 2016 and the layoffs are a step towards achieving that goal," the firm said in a statement. Nykredit is the largest mortgage lender in Denmark and one of the largest private bond issuers in Europe. The company announced plans for trimming the organisation in December last year. [ID:nL6N0JO1IB] The workforce will be cut by 300 next week. 220 employees will be fired while 80 unfilled jobs will not be refilled. After the redundancies the group will employ 3,700 people.
