SPRINGFIELD, Ill., March 26 (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Pat Quinn on Wednesday proposed making a temporary income tax rate hike permanent to keep the state budget afloat, while providing a property tax refund to homeowners.

"This comprehensive tax reform plan would maintain current income tax rates, allowing us to balance the budget, properly invest in education, and provide every Illinois homeowner with a guaranteed $500 property tax refund every year," the Democratic governor said in his budget address to the state legislature.
