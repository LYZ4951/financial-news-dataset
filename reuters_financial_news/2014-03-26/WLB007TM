LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Britain sold 4.2 billion pounds ($6.9 billion) of shares in Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> to cut its stake in the country's largest retail bank to 25 percent and put it on course for a complete exit in the next year at a profit.

UK Financial Investments, the body that manages Britain's stakes in Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>, said on Wednesday it sold a 7.8 percent stake in Lloyds, or 5.6 billion shares, at 75.5 pence a share, a 4.6 percent discount to Tuesday's closing price. UKFI announced it was placing the shares after markets closed on Tuesday. [ID:nL5N0MM4BD] Britain began to offload its 39 percent shareholding in Lloyds last September, which was seen as a milestone in the country's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, when taxpayers pumped a combined 66 billion pounds into Lloyds and RBS. Bankers and analysts said UKFI could completely sell its stake in Lloyds before a UK election due in 2015.
