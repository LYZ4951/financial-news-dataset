MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's biggest bank by assets, is expected to post a 13 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings due to higher lending income offsetting increased provisions for loan-losses as Russia's economy deteriorates, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.

State-controlled Sberbank - widely viewed as a proxy for the broader Russian economy - is expected to post a fourth quarter net profit of 96.3 billion roubles ($2.7 billion), the poll showed. Sberbank last August trimmed its estimate for full-year net profit to 370 billion roubles, at the lower end of a previous forecast range of 370-390 billion roubles. Net profit for the first nine months was 268.3 billion roubles. Gazprombank analyst Andrei Klapko forecast that net income for the year should total 360.6 billion roubles, 2.7 percent below the lower end of its forecast range. Sberbank unveiled an ambitious plan in November to double its assets and earnings by 2019 by lending more to consumers at home and developing its network of businesses abroad.
