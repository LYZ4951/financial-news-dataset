KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Reuters) - Maybank Islamic Bhd, the largest sharia bank in Southeast Asia, will set up a 10 billion ringgit ($3.03 billion) subordinated sukuk programme, ratings agency RAM ratings said on Wednesday.

RAM gave an AA1 or 'stable' rating for the program, citing the firm's "strategic importance" as the Islamic banking arm of Maybank <MBBM.KL>.  "Maybank Islamic is highly integrated with Maybank and leverages on its parent's risk-management systems, infrastructure and extensive branch network," said RAM.
