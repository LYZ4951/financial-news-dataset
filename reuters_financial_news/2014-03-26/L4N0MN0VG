KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Reuters) - State-backed mortgage lender Cagamas Bhd [CAGMAS.UL] has issued 500 million ringgit ($151.3 million) worth of three-month Islamic bond, its first sukuk for the year.

The sukuk was oversubscribed by 2.4 times as demand for high-grade papers with short tenures remains strong, Cagamas said in a statement on Tuesday. Investors have also taken a more cautious approach as the U.S. Federal Reserve slows its bond-buying, it added.
