March 26 (Reuters) - Cloud-based payroll processor TriNet Group Inc <TNET.N> said it priced its initial public offering at $16 per share, valuing the company at about $1.09 billion.

Backed by private equity firm General Atlantic LLC, TriNet's expected offering of 15 million shares would raise about $240 million at that price, which is at the mid-point of its planned $15-$17 price range. [ID:nPn1b92ZR]
