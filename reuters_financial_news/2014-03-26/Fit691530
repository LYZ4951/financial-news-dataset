March 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Non-financial corporate bonds now make up a much larger  part of the overall larger universe of outstanding corporate bonds compared with  before the financial crisis in both EMEA and the US, Fitch Ratings says in a new  quarterly report. Total combined corporate bonds outstanding in EMEA and the US have increased by  almost one-third since 2006 to reach USD10.3trn at end-2013. The growth was  driven by non-financial corporate bonds which more than doubled to USD6trn, now  accounting for almost 60% of the universe.  The fastest growing sector was EMEA non-financials, with 2013 issuance at 2.5x  the 2006 level, illustrating the impact of increased disintermediation as  companies switch from loans to bonds. By contrast, the amount of bonds issued by  financial institutions (FI) have shrunk in both the US and EMEA, reflecting  lower funding needs by banks focused on post-crisis deleveraging. If covered  bonds - which are important for EMEA banks - are included, total EMEA FI bonds  outstanding have risen by a modest 14%.  Nevertheless, the sector mix differs by region.  Financial bonds account for  just over half the total in EMEA but less than one-third in the US.  In terms of  relative regional scale, total EMEA bonds outstanding of USD5.6trn outstripped  the US amount by 18% in 2013. This figure would rise to 74% if covered bonds  were included. Covered bonds, which benefit from pools of collateral but also  recourse to the issuing institution, accounted for almost half EMEA financials  bonds outstanding at end-2013.  By contrast, the rating profile of the universes in the two regions is broadly  similar if excluding the large portion of 'AAA' rated EMEA financial bonds  consisting of covered bonds. For non-financials, the more developed high yield  market in the US is evident in the 28% non-investment grade share of bonds  outstanding, with the EMEA equivalent being just 21%.  Rating pressure has been modest in recent quarters, with the par value share of  outstanding bonds downgraded running at low single digits for both the financial  and non-financial sectors in the two regions. However, rating compression as a  result of negative rating activity since the crisis is evident in the rising  share of 'BBB'-rated issuance. Financials bond issuance in this rating category  has risen sharply since 2006 - by four times in the US and by 10 times in EMEA.  Rating downgrades of banks have been most severe in the eurozone.  Negative rating pressure in 2014 will likely focus on European banks, which face  a regulation-induced reduction in state support.  Issuance by this segment will  remain limited due to continued deleveraging and a weak economy. EMEA  non-financial corporates will continue to take advantage of low rates to  pre-finance. US bank issuance should continue to rebound with more robust US  growth.  Refinancing activity is still prominent but closer to exhaustion across  US non-financials. A stronger macro backdrop is a positive catalyst for rating  activity in this segment but likely offset by increased shareholder-oriented  transactions.
