SYDNEY, March 26 (Reuters) - Australian stocks rose 0.9 percent on Wednesday following a rebound on Wall Street, lifted by gains in mining stocks as copper and iron ore prices rose on hopes that China may move to stimulate a slowing economy.

Global miners BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> both climbed 1.9 percent. Fortescue Metals Group <FMG.AX> jumped 3.1 percent. The gains follow a 4 percent on Tuesday in China iron ore futures and rebar rose the most in 1 1/2 years in a rally fuelled by expectations that Beijing will implement measures to re-energise the economy. [ID:nL4N0MM1J6] "There have been concerns over the Chinese economy over the last two or three weeks, but interestingly enough the iron ore price has been slowly creeping up," said Will Cleland, associate director of institutional dealing at PhillipCapital.   "This shows maybe the iron ore price isn't as quite beholden to Chinese data as it was previously, as the U.S economy picks up steam," he said.   Other analysts said the possibility of China implementing stimulus boosted risk appetite in the local market. The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> added 46.3 points to 5,382.9 by 0022 GMT. The benchmark closed 0.2 percent lower at 5,336.6 on Tuesday.

Australia's "Big Four" banks all traded higher, led by a 1.0 percent gain in Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> and a 1.1 percent rise in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX>.  Domestic consumer stocks mostly moved up, with biggest supermarket Woolworths ltd <WOW.AX> rising 1.1 percent.  Department store David Jones jumped 1.0 percent, after local media reported bigger rival Myer Holdings Ltd <MYR.AX> looked set to sweeten an offer. Myer gained 0.9 percent.   Yancoal Australia Ltd <YAL.AX> slumped 5.5 percent after it said it had arranged a $300 million long-term debt facility from its majority owner, China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd, <600188.SS>, to fund working capital and capital expenditure.
