OSLO, March 26 (Reuters) - Norway's Vardia Insurance, which plans to complete an initial public offering on Thursday, expects strong growth in its Scandinavian markets and aims to pay dividends from 2016, Chief Executive Ivar Williksen told Reuters.

To fund its expansion, the company plans to raise 175-225 million crowns ($28.93-$37.20 million) by issuing up to 7.5 million shares at 30-40 crowns per share, with books closing on Thursday. The preliminary date set for listing on the Oslo Bourse is April 8. "The interest (from investors) has certainly been good, as expected," Williksen said in an interview, without revealing details of the demand for shares. Vardia targets the household insurance market in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, as well as smaller businesses, and aims to take an "active part" in consolidation of the Nordic insurance industry. "We will look at similar size businesses or portfolios that suit our structure, but we do not aim to buy big insurance companies," Williksen said. The company is well capitalised to meet future regulatory demands, and will only ask for more money from shareholders in case of acquisitions, he added. In February the company attracted 7,000 new customers and now has more than 100,000 in total. "This is the rate we expect going forward," Williksen said, adding that in the longer run renewals will be more important, with an expected rate of 85 percent. The company's ambition is a turnover of around three billion Norwegian crowns by the end of 2016, 25 percent return on equity and with a combined ratio below 80 percent. In the insurance industry, combined ratio is a key measure of profitability showing how much of insurance premiums is paid out in claims and operating expenses. "Our ambition is clearly to pay dividends from 2016," Williksen said. In 2013 the company had a turnover of 718 million crowns, resulting in a net loss of 50 million crowns, with a combined ratio of 162.7. "With the portfolio maturing, it provides for an improved combined ratio," the CEO said. Vardia was established in 2009, and after expanding the business in Norway and Sweden, it began to sell insurance in Denmark last month. It uses insurance agents and a portfolio of partnerships to attract customers away from the region's big casualty insurers, such as Gjensidige <GJFS.OL>, Tryg <TRYG.CO>, If <SAMAS.HE> and Sparebank 1.
