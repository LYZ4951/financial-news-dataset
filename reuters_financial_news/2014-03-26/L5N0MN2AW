WARSAW, March 26 (Reuters) - Poland may extend its flat interest rate guidance until next year, if nothing extraordinary happens with the economy, central bank Monetary Policy Council member Anna Zielinska-Glebocka was quoted as saying by private news agency ISBnews on Wednesday.

At the beginning of March, Poland's central bank extended its guidance by one quarter, saying interest rates will likely remain at their all-time low of 2.5 percent until at least the end of September 2014. "We've said that we won't do anything with rates until the third quarter and we stick to this for now. As far as I'm concerned, if nothing major happens to the economy we can extend the flat rates period until next year," Zielinska-Glebocka was quoted as saying. As a policymaker, Zielinska-Glebocka is not considered to be strongly tied to particular stance on rates. The central bank has cut borrowing costs by a total of 225 basis points since November 2012 to support sluggish economic growth, something it has been able to do because inflation has stayed low. Poland's growth is accelerating fast though. Finance Minister Mateusz Szczurek said on Wednesday it may exceed 3 percent in 2014, up from 1.6 percent last year.
