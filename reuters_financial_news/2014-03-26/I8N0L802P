MUMBAI, March 26 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose to a record high in early trading on Wednesday as blue chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> extended recent gains bolstered by buying from foreign institutional investors, while strength in other Asian markets also helped.

The NSE index <.NSEI> rose as much as 0.50 percent to an all-time high of 6,622.80 while the benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> ALSO ROSE 0.5 percent to a lifetime high of 22,162.52 to surpass their previous record highs hit just on Tuesday. Overseas investors have helped underpin gains, with net purchases in shares reaching $2.53 billion so far this month, according to regulatory data. Asian shares raced to two-week highs on Wednesday, with investor confidence getting a much needed boost from upbeat U.S. data and lingering hopes China may take steps to stimulate its sagging economy.
