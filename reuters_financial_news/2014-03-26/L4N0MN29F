MUMBAI, March 26 (Reuters) - Indian shares hit record highs for a third straight session on Wednesday as blue chips such as Larsen & Toubro extended recent gains bolstered by buying from foreign investors, on hopes of a recovery in the domestic economy.

Investors say the central bank's policy review on April 1, where it is widely expected to keeps rates unchanged, and general elections due by May would act as the next key catalysts for markets. Overseas investors have helped underpin gains, with net purchases in shares reaching $2.53 billion so far this month, according to regulatory data. Whether Indian equities can sustain the record-setting rally this month is becoming a big source of debate in markets with bull and bears making very persuasive arguments.

"Things are improving, macro economic turnaround is underway, pre-election wave can drive market to even higher levels, but I will watch global markets, U.S. short-term rates from here onwards," said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.
