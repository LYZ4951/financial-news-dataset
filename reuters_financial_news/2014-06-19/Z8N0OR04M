BERNE, June 19 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank is monitoring the impact on Switzerland of the recent interest rate cut in the euro zone closely and is ready to act if necessary, Chairman Thomas Jordan said at the central bank's rate-setting session on Thursday.

"We are closely monitoring the impact of the recent interest rate reductions in the euro area on Switzerland. Should there be a need for action, the SNB will take the necessary measures," Jordan said according to the text of a speech to be given at a news conference in Berne. The Swiss National Bank kept its lid on the Swiss franc at 1.20 per euro on Thursday and maintained rates close to zero. [ID:nZ8N0OR04I]
