MEXICO CITY, June 19 (Reuters) - Mexico's stock exchange will be connected to bourses in Chile, Colombia and Peru by the end of 2014 through the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA), a statement from the exchange said on Thursday.

MILA, whose members' total market capitalization currently stands at around $400 billion, was formed in 2011 to boost market liquidity within the Pacific Alliance trade bloc. The announcement came as a Pacific Alliance summit kicked off in the western Mexican coastal state of Nayarit.
