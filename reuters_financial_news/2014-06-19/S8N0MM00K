MADRID, June 19 (Reuters) - The euro zone's biggest bank Santander <SAN.MC> said on Thursday it had agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in its securities custody business to a holding led by U.S. buyout firm Warburg Pincus.

In a regulatory filing, Santander said it would book a 410-million-euro ($556.45 million) net capital gain on the sale of the business, valued at 975 million euros. It will retain a 50 percent stake. Singapore's Temasek is also part of the group that will become a new partner of Santander in the business.
