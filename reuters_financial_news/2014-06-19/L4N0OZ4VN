June 18 (Reuters) - Popular Inc <BPOP.O>, the parent of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, said it has received regulatory approval to repay $935 million to the U.S. Treasury Department that it received under the bank bailout program.

Popular intends to fund the repayment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds from a combination of internal liquidity and an issuance of approximately $400 million of debt securities, subject to market conditions.  As of May 31, $424.1 billion was  disbursed under TARP. Cumulative collections, together with Treasury's additional proceeds from the sale of non-TARP shares of AIG <AIG.N>, total $438.7 billion, according to a report by U.S. Treasury Department.
