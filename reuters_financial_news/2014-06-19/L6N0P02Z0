LAGOS, June 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria's treasury bill yields fell around 10 basis points across the board at an auction on Wednesday after central bank received subscriptions of almost 2-1/2 times the amount it wanted to sell from pension funds and foreign investors.

The central bank raised 168.28 billion naira ($1.03 bln), issuing treasury bills ranging from 3-months to one-year. Total demand stood at 404.32 billion naira, with the one-year bill attracting 58 percent of subscriptions, it said on Thursday. The bank issued 33.26 billion naira worth of 3-month bills at 9.9 percent, as against 10 percent the same tenor fetched at an earlier auction on June 4.
