June 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says there is no rating impact on Mercurio  Mortgage Finance S.r.l. Series 2012-7 from amendments to the transaction  documents.  The transaction is a prime Italian RMBS backed by residential mortgage loans  granted by the Italian branch of Barclays Bank Plc (Barclays, A/Stable/F1).  The amendments are intended to increase the repayment speed of the notes through  higher prepayments of the underlying mortgage portfolio. In order to achieve  this, the servicer, Barclays, plans to offer a principal discount within a  certain percentage range to selected borrowers who accept to prepay the  outstanding mortgage amount. The servicer will also cover the principal  discount, by paying it to the SPV. Consequently, the SPV will not suffer any  loss. Fitch has assessed the potential credit link between the servicer and the notes  and modeled the potential loss that the transaction would be exposed to in case  of servicer default. The agency found that the available credit enhancement is  sufficient to withstand this stress, thus the rating of the notes is not  constrained by Barclays' rating.   The rating of the notes is as follows: Mercurio Mortgage Finance S.r.l. - Series 2012-7
