WARSAW, June 19 (Reuters) - Poland's main opposition party Law and Justice (PiS) was ahead of the ruling Civic Platform (PO) party in an opinion poll released on Wednesday evening by broadcaster TVN.

According to pollster Millward Brown, which surveyed 1,004 people on June 17, PiS had the support of 32 percent of voters. PO, in power since 2007, had 25 percent support. The poll was conducted after the Wprost magazine has revealed secretly recorded discussion of the central bank governor and interior minister about the removal of another minister and ways to put pressure on a private businessman. On Thursday Poland's President, Bronislaw Komorowski, and Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said an early election was a possibility after security forces raided a Wprost magazine, embarrassing the government and provoking a storm of protest about press freedom. According to Millward Brown, 47 percent of Poles think that Poland should hold early elections, but at the same time 66 percent of potential voters are against the idea of PiS leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, becoming Poland's prime minister.
