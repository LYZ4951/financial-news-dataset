June 19 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc <RBS.L> agreed on Thursday to pay $99.5 million to resolve a U.S. regulator's claims against the bank in litigation contending that Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> bought mortgage-backed securities that later went sour.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency said the accord related to litigation also naming Ally Financial Inc, which previously settled, as a defendant. It is the 15th settlement arising from lawsuits that the FHFA filed in 2011 over mortgage securities losses suffered by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB>, both of which it oversees as conservator.
