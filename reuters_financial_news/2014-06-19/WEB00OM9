PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Siemens <SIEGn.DE> and Japanese partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> have revised their alliance proposal to engineering group Alstom, French trade unions said on Thursday after U.S. rival General Electric <GE.N> revamped its own rival offer.

Bernard Devert, head of the metallurgy arm of CGT trade union, told Reuters that Mitsubishi Heavy was now offering to put a further 800 million euros on the table to take higher stakes in two parts of Alstom's business.
