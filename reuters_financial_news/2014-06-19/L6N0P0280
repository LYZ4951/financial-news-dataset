ZURICH, June 19 (Reuters) - Vontobel Holding <VONN.S> shares rose on Thursday after fund manager Rajiv Jain, who runs one of the world's largest emerging-markets funds, said he was committed to the Swiss bank, rebutting speculation he was about to leave.

Vontobel shares, which had shed more than 8 percent earlier this week due to speculation Jain would depart, were up 3.8 percent at 31.25 Swiss francs by 0904 GMT, outpacing a 0.5 percent rise in the wider European sector <.SX7P>.  "As Mark Twain said, the rumours of my death are greatly exaggerated," 46-year-old Jain told Reuters in a phone interview on Wednesday. "I think there clearly has been a change in Vontobel New York so I think as a logical fallout of that, people always speculate." [ID:nL6N0OZ1WC]
