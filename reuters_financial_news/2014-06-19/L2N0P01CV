June 19 (Reuters) - Omega Advisors' Steven Einhorn said Thursday that the bull market in U.S. equities is not over and predicts the Standard & Poor's 500 Index will rise another 3-5 percent by year-end.

In an interview with Reuters, Einhorn said Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has made clear that the U.S. central bank will keep monetary policy 'easy for an extended period of time' which is supportive of stock prices.
