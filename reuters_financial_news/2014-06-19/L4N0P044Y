June 19 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn said in a letter to Family Dollar Stores Inc <FDO.N> that the company be put up for sale immediately, according to a regulatory filing.

Earlier this month, Family Dollar adopted a poison pill to buy time to consider any possible deal that Icahn could push for after becoming its largest shareholder. [ID:nL4N0OQ3DT] Icahn also said in the filing that three or four of his representatives should be added to the company's board immediately. (http://reut.rs/1kSQ9mt)
