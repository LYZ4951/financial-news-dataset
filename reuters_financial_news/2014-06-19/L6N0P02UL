FRANKFURT, June 19 (Reuters) - German life insurers will shift quickly towards new savings products with fewer guarantees as the sector responds to the challenge of low interest rates and tighter regulation, a top German regulator predicted.

Officials have been urging the country's more than 90 life insurers to broaden their product palette beyond traditional savings products that offer a guaranteed rate of return, said Felix Hufeld, head of insurance supervision at German financial watchdog Bafin.
