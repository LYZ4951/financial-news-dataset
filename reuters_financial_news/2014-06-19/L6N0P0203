BUCHAREST, June 19 (Reuters) - The Hungarian forint <EURHUF=> and Polish zloty <EURPLN=> firmed against the euro on Thursday, after the Federal Reserve repeated it will keep U.S. interest rates low, boosting demand for higher yielding assets.

By 0830 GMT, the zloty and forint were each trading 0.6 percent higher from the previous session. Blue chip stocks in Prague and Budapest were also posting gains. Late on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced a further $10 billion cut in its monthly bond purchases, as expected, and said again that interest rates would remain near zero "for a considerable time" after bond-buying ends. [ID:nW1N0L300P] "The forint has firmed as the dollar has weakened, and the zloty also firmed, as the entire region is stronger after the Fed," said one forex dealer in Budapest.  A lawmaker from Hungary's ruling Fidesz party told Reuters that new measures to help households struggling with expensive foreign currency loans could cost banks 400 billion forints ($1.77 billion).  Gergely Gulyas said banks will also have to foot most of the bill for reducing forex loan repayments and fixing them in forints by the end of this year. He said converting forex loans into forints would make the economy less vulnerable to exchange rate speculation but stressed the government has no target for the currency. [[ID:nL6N0OZ2VS] The Fed's announcement overshadowed market concerns about the potential political fallout in Poland from a recording of central bank Governor Marek Belka insulting colleagues which surfaced earlier this week. [ID:nL5N0OW0Y8] Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday an early parliamentary election was one possible option. President Bronislaw Komorowski also said an election should be called if it proves impossible to resolve the row by normal means. [ID:nL6N0P01A1][ID:nL6N0P01ZS] Weaker than expected data could also pressure the zloty.  "After the weak PPI and IP print yesterday ... rate cut expectations are increasing," SEB said in a research note. "Money markets are also beginning to price in a cut, with the 6x9 FRA and 3M Wibor spread widening from 13 basis points to 30 basis points yesterday."
