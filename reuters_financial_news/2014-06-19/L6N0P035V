JERUSALEM, June 19 (Reuters) - Israeli energy and insurance conglomerate Delek Group <DLEKG.TA> said on Thursday it agreed to sell a 36 percent stake in its U.S. insurance business Republic Group to a group of unnamed investors, less than a previously announced 55 percent.

The deal is worth $80 million, Delek said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and the buyers have a three-year option to purchase an additional 19 percent. The valuation of Dallas-based Republic remained at $220 million, the same as it was when the initial deal had been announced in April.
