BEIJING, June 19 (Reuters) - China's central bank said on Thursday it had designated Bank of China <601988.SS>, the country's main foreign exchange lender, as the yuan clearing service bank in Frankfurt, another step toward expanding the Chinese currency's footprint in the fast-growing offshore RMB market.

The People's Bank of China made the announcement in a statement posted on its website, following the announcement on Wednesday that China Construction Bank <601939.SS> was selected as the first yuan clearing bank in London. Global financial capitals, such as London and Singapore, have been racing to secure a slice of the fast-growing RMB offshore business.
