DUBAI, June 19 (Reuters) - Banque Saudi Fransi <1050.SE>, the kingdom's fourth-largest listed lender, has completed a capital-boosting sukuk issue worth 2 billion riyals ($533 million), it said in a statement on Thursday.

The Islamic bond, which has a ten-year lifespan but with an option for the bank to repay investors after the fifth year, priced at 140 basis points over the three-month Saudi interbank offered rate (Saibor). The transaction, which will boost the bank's Tier 2 - or supplementary - capital, will support Banque Saudi Fransi's capital base and future growth, the statement added.
