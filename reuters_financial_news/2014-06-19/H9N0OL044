HONG KONG, June 19 (Reuters) - China shares had their biggest daily losses in more than seven weeks on Thursday, as the diversion of a sizable amount of capital for initial public offerings continued to weigh on markets.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> slid 1.6 percent at 2,023.73 points, its biggest daily loss since April 28. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 1.5 percent, its worst day since April 21. Both fell for a third day in a row. Five companies from the first batch to pursue listings after a four-month lull are taking subscriptions. Relatively low price-earnings ratios are attracting money from existing stocks. Investors keen on coming IPOs have turned to little-known overnight pledged bond repurchase agreements for funds - driving up the cost of borrowing nearly four-fold.

Sinolink Securities <600109.SS> and Founder Securities <601901.SS> shed 4.4 and 3.3 percent, respectively. Chinese nickel companies were hard hit on Thursday, as prices for the base metal slid 2 percent with stockpile on the London Metal Exchange surging to a high. [ID:nL6N0OZ1K7]
