LUXEMBOURG, June 19 (Reuters) - A revised offer by General Electric <GE.N> for a tie-up with Alstom <ALSO.PA> is a "substantial improvement" on its previous proposal, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Thursday.

"You see, the government was right to intervene," he told reporters on the margins of a meeting of European finance ministers in Luxembourg. GE said earlier its new offer had been agreed with Alstom management and would create an "alliance" with 50:50 joint ventures in grid, nuclear and renewable assets.
