WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - The United States is set to announce new measures against Uganda on Thursday in response to the signing of a law by President Yoweri Museveni in February that imposes harsh penalties for homosexuality, senior administration officials said.

The White House announcement, expected later in the day, will ratchet up punishment on those implementing the law, officials told Reuters.
