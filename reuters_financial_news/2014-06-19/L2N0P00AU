TORONTO, June 19 (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd <BBRY.O> <BB.TO> reported a narrower than expected adjusted loss on Thursday even as revenue fell in the midst of the troubled smartphone maker's turnaround push.

The Waterloo, Ontario-based company reported net income of $23 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a loss of $84 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time non-cash accounting gain and certain restructuring charges, the loss was $60 million, or 11 cents a share.
