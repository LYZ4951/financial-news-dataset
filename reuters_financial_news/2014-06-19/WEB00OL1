PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Alstom <ALSO.PA> CEO Patrick Kron told an investor conference that Germany's Siemens <SIEGn.DE> could "dream" of swapping assets with the French engineering group, Exane BNP Paribas wrote in a note on Thursday.

"They want our gas activities... and we should take their Transport business...well they are allowed to dream. At the end of the day, despite some impressions to the contrary, it will be the shareholders who decide," Kron reportedly told the broker's European Seminar on Wednesday. An Alstom spokeswoman declined to comment. Alstom's board is due to decide by Monday between a 12.4-billion-euro ($16.8 billion) cash offer for its power arm from U.S. group General Electric <GE.N> and a competing proposal from Siemens and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) <7011.T>.
