June 18 (Reuters) - A list of potential bidders for the Bitcoin auction was accidentally leaked by the U.S. Marshals Service on Wednesday, according to the agency.

The Marshals Service confirmed that it accidentally released the names in an email to update interested parties on the auction's guidelines. "The U.S. Marshals Service inadvertently sent an email today revealing the email addresses of people who had submitted questions about the Bitcoin auction to a general USMS mailbox that had been created for the auction," Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals, said in an emailed statement.  "The USMS apologizes for this mistake which was in no way intentional," the statement said.  The news was first reported by the New York Times, citing a report from CoinDesk, an online website devoted to Bitcoin.
