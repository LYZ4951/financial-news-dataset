NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended June 18 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $4 billion to $1.042 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $3.8 billion to $1.096 trillion.
