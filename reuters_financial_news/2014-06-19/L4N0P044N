June 19 (Reuters) - Stifel Financial Corp <SF.N> said its broker-dealer unit, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co Inc, hired three financial advisers from Raymond James <RJF.N> and established a new private client group office in Atlanta.

Richard "Dick" McGalliard, John McHale and Ryan Stewart worked for Morgan Keegan, the Tennessee-based brokerage firm that Raymond James bought in 2012. A Raymond James spokeswoman confirmed the departures. Stifel said Robert Chanin, a 34-year investment industry veteran currently based in Stifel's office in Macon, Georgia, would also join the private client group. Chanin will split his time between Atlanta and Macon.
