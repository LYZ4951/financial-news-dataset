BUDAPEST, June 19 (Reuters) - Hungary plans to eliminate foreign currency mortgages by the end of the year with a comprehensive package for borrowers whose roughly $1.8 billion cost could exceed the hit to banks from a previous relief scheme in 2011.

Following are highlights from an interview with Gergely Gulyas, a top lawmaker in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party, conducted late on Wednesday. For main story, see [ID:nL6N0OZ2VS] For court ruling on FX mortgages, see [ID:nL5N0OX1JT]  SUPREME COURT RULING "On the issue of the exchange rate spread, the ruling of the Supreme Court is entirely clear. This banking practice was unlawful. Therefore, banks have a settlement obligation with clients in this regard. "The issue of unilateral contract modifications, which effectively means interest rate hikes, is almost equally as straightforward. The question here is the same as with the exchange rate spread: how the damage caused by this unlawful practice to borrowers will be compensated. Lawmakers will have to find an appropriate solution to this problem as well. "The same way as borrowers have managed to withstand these unlawful practices applied by the banks, banks will also be able to withstand the rectification of this."  EXCHANGE RATE LOSSES "We have also made it clear that we want to eliminate foreign currency loans from the lending market once and for all, which leads on to the third point, namely the issue of exchange rate losses. "We have already made a number of decisions in this regard, which point in some kind of direction. There is an optional exchange rate cap system, there is an national asset manager ... and there was the final repayment scheme. "The goal now is that this should be a comprehensive solution involving everyone with a (foreign currency) home loan or mortgage. "Given that the goal is to eliminate foreign currency mortgages once and for all, there is no alternative but to see that most of these deals were made in the Swiss franc, and to some extent the euro, and fixing instalments (repayments) is possible only in forints."  FORINT "Another positive impact on the economy is that each economic policy measure can have an impact on the exchange rate. The government has no exchange rate target but such a magnitude of household foreign currency exposure always had to be a consideration in economic policy. This will obviously ease once (these loans) are no longer denominated in foreign currencies." "The government has no exchange rate target, and as such, it does not aim to weaken the forint."  LOWER MONTHLY REPAYMENTS "We hope this will result in a meaningful decline in monthly repayments and even, in the best cases, in outstanding principal, as soon as this year," Gulyas said. "There is no decision on the scale of this reduction.
