COPENHAGEN, June 19 (Reuters) - The Copenhagen stock market said on Thursday it was looking into a number of measures that would aim to encourage more small- and mid-cap companies to go public in Denmark.

Proposals in a report by Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen, some of which would need parliament approval, included simplifying the application process for listing on the bourse. Two companies, beauty product retailer Matas <MATAS.CO> and business services firm ISS <ISS.CO>, have debuted on the Copenhagen bourse to date this year. Neighbouring Sweden, meanwhile, has seen eight companies debut on the Stockholm bourse since November.
