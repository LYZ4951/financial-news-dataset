NEW YORK/LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - Sprint Corp <S.N> has lined up eight banks to finance its proposed acquisition of T-Mobile US Inc <TMUS.N>, edging closer to a deal that would merge the third- and fourth-biggest U.S. mobile operators, according to people familiar with the matter.

The debt package exceeds $40 billion and includes a bridge loan of roughly $20 billion from Japan's Softbank Corp <9984.T> to Sprint, as well as a $20 billion refinancing of T-Mobile's existing debt, the people said this week.  Five global banks - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, Goldman Sachs Group <GS.N>, Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE>, Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> - have agreed to finance Sprint's proposal to acquire the smaller rival, the people said. Sprint, majority-owned by Softbank, has also tapped Japanese banks Mizuho Financial Group Inc <8411.T>, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group <8316.T>, the people added. The companies will seek to finalize details of the financing in the coming month so they could announce a merger around August, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Softbank and T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom AG <DTEGn.DE> have agreed to broad terms of a deal, under which Sprint would pay around $40 per share for T-Mobile, valuing the smaller rival at nearly $32 billion, Reuters and others reported earlier this month. [ID:nL1N0OL2MT] Deutsche Telekom stands to pay a breakup fee of roughly $1 billion if it tries to get out of the deal, while the so-called reverse breakup fee that Softbank would have to pay should regulators block the transaction is about $2 billion, one person said.
