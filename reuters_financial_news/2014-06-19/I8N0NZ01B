MUMBAI, June 19 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a second straight session on Thursday, as oil stocks such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS> slumped on worries that higher gas pricing may be allowed only for incremental output while violence in Iraq continued to weigh.

ONGC provisionally fell 4.8 percent while Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> ended lower 2.5 percent.
