June 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Argentum Capital S.A.'s EUR10m Series 2014-20 secured repackaged notes, due September 2034 (ISIN XS1056161471) a 'BBBsf' rating with Stable Outlook.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating addresses the timely payment of interest on the notes according to  the terms and conditions of the documentation, as well as the repayment of  principal by legal final maturity in August 2034. The rating reflects the credit  quality of two risk-presenting entities, as well as the legal and financial  structure of the issuer. The two risk-presenting entities are Credit Suisse  International [CSFBIL.UL] (A/Stable/F1) and Italy (BBB+/Stable/F2). At closing on 4 May 2014, the proceeds from the note issuance were used to  purchase an Italian government inflation linked bond (ISIN IT0003535157) and to  enter into an asset swap with Credit Suisse International. The swap counterparty  claims will rank senior to noteholders in all circumstances except where Credit  Suisse International (as swap counterparty) is the defaulting party. The asset  swap pays annually a variable rate coupon based on four times the difference  between 10-year EUR-ISDA-EURIBOR and two-year EUR-ISDA-EURIBOR, capped at 8.0%,  and floored at 0.0% in return for the interest receipts on the Italian  government bonds the coupon of which is 5.0% and paid semi-annually. The notes  are secured by the Italian government bonds. The notes are issued by Argentum Capital S.A., a programme arranged by Credit  Suisse International with limited liability and incorporated under Luxembourg  law. Non-petition language included in the master programme agreements warrant  that no party to any series will be able to petition for the winding-up of the  issuer as a consequence of the default of any particular series. In addition,  limited recourse clauses in the programme restrict the noteholder of any other  series to only have recourse to the collateral assigned to this series.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
