PARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - French state bank BPI is ready to take a stake in the future structure of Alstom <ALSO.PA> regardless of whom the engineering group decides to tie its fate to, a source close to the talks said on Thursday.

Alstom's board is due to decide by Monday between a 12.4-billion-euro ($16.8 billion) cash offer for its power arm from U.S. group General Electric <GE.N> and a competing proposal from Siemens <SIEGn.DE> and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) <7011.T>.
