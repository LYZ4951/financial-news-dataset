HONG KONG, June 19 (Reuters) - China shares extended losses by midday on Thursday, as the lock-up of a sizeable amount of capital for initial public offerings continued to weigh on the markets.

Hong Kong shares rose slightly, buoyed by Wall Street's optimism after the U.S. Federal Reserve gave a positive assessment of the economy and committed to retaining accommodative monetary policy. [ID:nW1N0L300P] By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was up 0.3 percent at 23,250.56 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong held a soft tone, off 0.1 percent. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings and the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> each lost 0.5 percent and appeared on track for a third straight daily loss. The Shanghai benchmark stood at 2,045.49 points. In the mainland, the first four Chinese companies pushed ahead with new listings after a four-month lull in IPOs, starting to take subscriptions on Wednesday with the aim of raising a combined 1.7 billion yuan ($273.80 million).  A fifth company - Ellington Electronics Technology - started to take IPO subscriptions on Thursday.  "The companies are selling their new shares at relatively low price-earnings ratios, so some investors are diverting money from existing holdings for the IPOs. We see strong demand in offline subscription," said Zhang Qi, a Shanghai-based analyst with Haitong Securities.  But Zhang added he did not expect a deep correction in the A-share market given the overall stable economy.  On Wednesday, Premier Li Keqiang said during his visit to Britain that China's economy would not suffer a hard landing and would continue to grow at a medium to high pace in the long term without strong stimulus.

[ID:nL6N0OZ1K7] Jilin Ji En Nickel Industry <600432.SS> dived 7.9 percent and Chengdu Huaze Cobalt & Nickel Material <000693.SZ> 6.7 percent. In Hong Kong, CNOOC <0883.HK> gained 1.6 percent to its highest since Jan. 2. The stock rose a more moderate 0.4 percent on Wednesday after it announced a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with BP.
