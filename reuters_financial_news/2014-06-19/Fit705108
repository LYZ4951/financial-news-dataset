June 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Islamic Development Bank's [ISDBA.UL] (IsDB) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook and its Short-term IDR at 'F1+'.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation and Stable Outlook reflect the following key rating factors: IsDB is one of the strongest-capitalised multilateral development banks (MDBs)  rated by Fitch, with an equity-to-assets ratio of 54% and a debt-to-equity ratio  of 79.5% at end-1434H (3 November 2013 in the Gregorian calendar). Although  capitalisation has been steadily declining due to a scale-up in operations since  the global financial crisis, Fitch believes that capital buffers are large  enough to ensure continued strong capitalisation in line with targeted growth of  operations. Credit risk remains moderate but higher than peers, arguing for stronger capital  buffers than peers. The estimated average rating of non-equity operations was  'B+' at end-1434H, at the lower range of peers, but 85.5% of them were extended  to or guaranteed by sovereigns, on which the bank benefits from preferred  creditor status. Private sector operations are higher than in some peers (21.7%  of total operations, including equity stakes), but impairments based on IsDB's  definition have historically remained low, at 1% of non-equity operations at  end-1434H, and are adequately provisioned for. The moderate level of country and  obligor concentration also mitigates credit risk arising from non-equity  operations. IsDB has higher equity participations (accounting for 8.4% of total operations  at end-1434H) than commonly seen among peers, which represents a rating  weakness. However, concentration in this portfolio is moderate and risks are  mitigated by IsDB's long-term outlook on these equity participations and  disposals have usually been made at a profit with favourable timing.  Other risks are manageable. Liquidity is adequate, with treasury assets covering  153.3% of short-term liabilities at end-1434H, in line with peers. Only 24.2% of  treasury assets were invested in instruments (mostly bank deposits) rated 'AA-'  and above at end-1434H, but the risk is mitigated by heavy recourse to  short-term maturities in a diversified range of banks. Interest-rate and  foreign-exchange risks are tightly hedged. Risk management is conservative and the bank consistently abides by its  self-imposed risk management framework. Even though some limits have recently  been relaxed (the leverage limit was raised to 100% from 50%), the risk  framework remains stringent, and IsDB is progressively aligning it (eg, on the  liquidity policy and new capital adequacy framework) with that of other  highly-rated peers. As is typical of most MDBs, IsDB is not profit-oriented and does not distribute  dividends. Profits are moderate compared with commercial banks, but are steady  and in line with peers (with a return on equity of 2.5% in 1434H), ensuring  regular equity strengthening. Shareholder support, a secondary rating driver, remains strong. The credit  quality of member countries is lower than usually observed among peers, with an  estimated average rating of 'BBB-' at end-1434H; however, they have consistently  demonstrated their propensity to support the bank through regular inflows of  fresh capital. The latest general capital increases  will increase callable  capital threefold while adding another 3.6bn Islamic dinars (equivalent to the  SDR) in paid-in capital over 20 years, which will support expected growth in  activity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's assessment that downside risks to the 'AAA'  rating are currently not material. Given that IsDB's ratings are not driven by  support, a moderate weakening in the credit quality of the shareholders would  not jeopardise the ratings. Downward pressure on IsDB's ratings would result from pronounced deterioration  of asset quality or unexpected deterioration in capitalisation and leverage.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS
