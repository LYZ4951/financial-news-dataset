June 19 (Reuters) - The $5.3 trillion-a-day global currency market, the world's biggest and least-regulated financial marketplace, has been rocked by allegations of collusion and price-rigging.

Regulators around the world, including the U.S. Department of Justice and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority have been formally investigating since October last year. Since the allegations first surfaced last year, some 40 traders have been placed on leave, suspended or fired by some of the world's biggest banks. No individual or bank has been accused of wrongdoing and no evidence of wrongdoing has been found. All the banks involved are cooperating with the regulators. Below are some of the main stories tracking the development of the investigation, which is likely to run into next year at least and could end up being bigger than the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal.  > EXCLUSIVE: FX chatrooms show traders shared order, price details - sources [ID:nL5N0OY4GB] > FX dealers in London can trade trillions, without being registered [ID:nL6N0NK2HT] > FX currency probe drives bank demand for Big Brother software [ID:nL6N0N71DE] > Senior central bank officials, forex industry meet to address FX fixing reform [ID:nL6N0N240N] > EXCLUSIVE: Chatroom evidence questions BoE role in FX probe -sources [ID:nL2N0MH0BJ] > Bank of England announces shake-up as it probes FX case [ID:nL6N0M833C] > INSIGHT: Soft touch FX regulation falls under harsh glare [ID:nL3N0M441V] > BoE minutes reveal currency rigging fears first raised in 2006 [ID:nL6N0M23JY] > Bank of England suspends official amid FX probe [ID:nL6N0M222H] > EXCLUSIVE: UBS seeks first-mover immunity in U.S. currency probe [ID:nL5N0L9222] > German watchdog to visit Deutsche in London in FX probe -source [ID:nL5N0KU2OR] > Bank of England discussed currency rate-setting 18 months before probe [ID:nL5N0KQ2RT]
