June 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Turkey's Alternatif Finansal  Kiralama A.S. (Alease) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of 'BBB' and ' BBB+', respectively, Short-term foreign and local  currency IDRs of 'F3' and 'F2', respectively, a National Long-term rating of  'AAA(tur)' and a Support Rating of '2'. The Outlooks on the Long-term ratings  are Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Alease's ratings are equalised with those of its parent Alternatif Bank A.S.  (Abank: BBB/Stable) and reflect the high potential of support from Abank, which  has been the company's 100%-owner since 2013. Nevertheless, Fitch believes that  support, if needed, is likely to be provided by Abank's ultimate parent,  Commercial Bank of Qatar <COMB.QA> (CBQ, A/Stable).  In Fitch's view, Abank is strategically important to CBQ and to date, is CBQ's  largest international acquisition. Alease, which provides finance leasing to  small and medium sized companies (SMEs), complements Abank's product range in  the fairly competitive Turkish banking sector.   The ratings also reflect common branding and high reputational risk for Abank  and high integration. Alease's board of directors now includes Abank's CEO and  CBQ's CEO in addition to three other members from Abank's board of directors  (one of whom was CBQ's CFO until 2013). Alease's activity is also supervised by  Abank through common risk, audit and asset and liabilities management  committees. The bank provides support in terms of product distribution (44% of  Alease's sales were realised by the bank's branch while the referral target for  2014 is 50%), technology and other operational functions.  Regulations in Turkey limit banks' ability to offer leasing services directly,  necessitating the establishment of separate legal entities.  Alease is a mid-sized leasing company, ranking 11th out of 22 leasing companies  by assets at end-2013. Alease was established in 1997 by Abank and was acquired  by Abank's then major shareholder - Anadolu Endustri Holding AS (Anadolu) in  2003. In July 2013, CBQ acquired majority ownership (70%) of Abank (see 'Fitch  Upgrades Alternatifbank on Ownership Change', published on 23 July 2013) and in  November 2013, Abank acquired back ownership of Alease from Anadolu.
