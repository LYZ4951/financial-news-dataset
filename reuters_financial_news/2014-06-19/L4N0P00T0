SEOUL, June 19 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged higher on Thursday on optimism over the U.S. Federal Reserve's commitment to retain an accommodative monetary policy, offsetting worries over Samsung Electronics' April-June earnings outlook.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.1 percent at 1,992.03 points after touching an intraday low of 1,985.89. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>, KOSPI's largest component, fell 2.6 percent on worries about the coming April-June quarter earnings after local brokerages cut their forecast. The won <KRW=> rose against the dollar to snap a five-day losing streak, buoyed by the Fed meeting outcome.
