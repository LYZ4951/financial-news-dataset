NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc <ABBV.N> has recently approached London-listed Shire PLC <SHP.L> about a potential takeover, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the latest attempt by U.S. healthcare companies looking to acquire overseas rivals partly to lower their tax rates.

AbbVie, which makes rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, has a market capitalization of around $86 billion, while Shire has a market capitalization of roughly $38 billion. The companies have held talks in recent weeks following AbbVie's takeover approach, but there is no guarantee the discussions will lead to a transaction, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. It is also possible that other suitors will emerge for Shire, the people added. Representatives for AbbVie and Shire could not be immediately reached for comment.  Founded in 1986 in Britain, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. With its tax base in Ireland, where effective corporate tax rates are among the lowest in the world, Shire, with a mid-sized market value, has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers. Shire is weighing AbbVie's approach against the merits of remaining independent, as its chief executive Fleming Ornskov has only completed his first year on the job and has an alternative strategy of growing through acquisitions, one of the people said. Shire specializes in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which account for around 40 percent of its sales. The firm also sells pricey drugs to treat rare genetic disorders and is building up a portfolio of treatments in ophthalmology and other specialty disease areas. AbbVie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, was founded last year as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories <ABT.N>. The company has been criticized for its overreliance on its top drug, Humira, which comprised over half of its revenue in the most recent quarter.
