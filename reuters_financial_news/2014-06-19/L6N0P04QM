LONDON, June 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's 2017 dollar bond fell sharply on Thursday after an international finance official said Ukraine is holding talks with creditors on restructuring its foreign currency debts.

"The Ukrainian authorities made very clear to us that they would consider this only as a really, truly voluntary operation agreed by the bondholders," Lubomir Mitov, an economist with the Institute of International Finance, told journalists by phone. [ID:nL2N0P00TM] "A voluntary exchange or maturity extension could be one of the sources for financing." The bond dropped 2.5 points from Wednesday's close to 97  <XS0808758196=R>, giving a yield of 10.2 percent, according to Reuters data. "The mention of 'restructuring' is causing people to reduce exposure," said Tim Ash at Standard Bank in a client note.
