MUMBAI, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Shares in India's biggest property developer DLF Ltd <DLF.NS> surged nearly 10 percent on Thursday after starting the session by slumping to a record low as investors were attracted by cheaper valuations following a recent slump.

DLF slumped 28.6 percent on Tuesday after India's securities regulator banned it from the capital markets for three years over violations related to disclosures for its 2007 listing. [ID:nL3N0S93OH]
