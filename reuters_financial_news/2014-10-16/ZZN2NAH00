SHANGHAI, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished lower on Thursday on worries over slowing global growth prompted by a slew of weak U.S. economic data, but losses were limited by a more positive outlook on China.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 1.0 percent at 22,900.94 points, with the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also down 1.0 percent.  Some analysts said better-than-expected money supply and lending data from the mainland as well as the approaching announcement of the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connector launch date dampened the negative impact of weaker overseas markets.
