Oct 16 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc <ABBV.N> recommended stockholders to vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire Plc <SHP.L> in the wake of a U.S. government move to curb "inversion" deals that allow companies to escape high U.S. taxes by reincorporating abroad.

"The agreed upon valuation is no longer supported as a result of the changes to the tax rules and we did not believe it was in the best interests of our stockholders to proceed," AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said in a statement. [ID:nPreBGDxSa]
