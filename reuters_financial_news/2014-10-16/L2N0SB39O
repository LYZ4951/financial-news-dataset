SAO PAULO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Santander SA <SAN.MC> and its Brazilian unit changed on Thursday the ratio at which they plan to swap their stock, part of a $6.5 billion buyout of the latter, amid delays to complete the transaction.

Santander will now give shareholders of Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA> the equivalent of 0.7152 local depositary receipts per unit, up from a prior 0.70-to-1 ratio. Holders of Santander Brasil's common and preferred shares will get 0.3576 of Banco Santander's depositary receipts per each of their holdings.
