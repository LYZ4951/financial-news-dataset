PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The French government said this week it would sell between 8 and 10 billion euros ($10.2-12.8 billion) worth of its holdings in listed companies over the next 18 months, at least doubling the 4 billion euros already on the block under the 2015 budget.

France holds stakes in several companies through a number of holding structures.  Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron was referring to the 76 billion euros worth of stocks held through state holding company Agence Participations de l'Etat (APE), a body created in 2004 with a mandate to invest in strategic companies, stabilise their capital or support them through development or  transformation. Below are the stakes the government may use to meet its target. (Source APE.
