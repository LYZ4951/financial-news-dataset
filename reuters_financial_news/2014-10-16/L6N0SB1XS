LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman and chief executive of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N>, has cut his vehicle's stake in troubled British grocer Tesco <TSCO.L> to below 3 percent, according to a stock market notification.

The filing, published on Thursday, said that on Oct. 13 Berkshire reduced its Tesco holding to "less than 3 percent". Earlier this month Buffett said Berkshire's investment in Tesco was a "huge mistake." Berkshire had a roughly 3.96 percent stake in Tesco's shares, according to an early May regulatory filing.
