TORONTO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said on Thursday his lawyers have seen documents that he said show Allergan's board knowingly misled investors as part of a defensive strategy to stave off prospective buyer Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc <VRX.TO>.

Ackman said he had not yet reviewed the documents himself, and did not give any copies of them to reporters, whom he was speaking to on the sidelines of a conference. Reuters could not independently verify his claim.  Allergan representatives were not immediately available for comment. Ackman told reporters in Toronto: "We believe they put those statements out, that they knew that they were false at the time they made them, and we have found evidence to that effect, that this was a conscious takeover defense strategy to malign Valeant and the company."
