WARSAW, Oct 16 (Reuters) - General Electrics Co <GE.N> is considering selling its majority stake in Polish Bank BPH <BPHP.WA> as part of GE's wider shift away from finance and towards industry, GE Capital said on Thursday.

"It is GE's broader strategy to shift its earnings mix to 75 percent industrial and 25 percent financial, with GE Capital focusing on growing our core, commercial business," a GE Capital's spokeswoman, Katja Antila, said.
