OSLO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The turmoil in financial markets is impacting investors' willingness to participate in initial public offerings, but the door to new listings still remains ajar, the head of Nordic brokerage ABG Sundal Collier <ASC.OL> said on Thursday.

The company's third-quarter revenues and earnings rose from the same period last year, and by 0850 GMT the ABG share traded 2.4 percent higher in Oslo. [ID:nL6N0SB1ER] Chief Executive Officer Knut Brundtland made the following comments:  ON FINANCIAL MARKETS "There was a clear shift in the market late in the third quarter and at the start of the fourth. Fear has crept in during the last few weeks. Will things hold up or are we on our way to a new recession? That's what's been weighing on markets."  ON IPOs "The stress index has risen sharply, to a level that's negative for activity. The market has for a long time been open to merger and acquisition activities (M&A) and initial public offerings (IPO), but that's changed somewhat." "We've just completed the XXL IPO, we're about to complete Entra's IPO, and in addition we've got a significant pipeline of IPOs coming up both in Norway and Sweden. But an IPO isn't complete until it's completed, and much will depend on the market stress index not rising further."  ON M&A TREND
