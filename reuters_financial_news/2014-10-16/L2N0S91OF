MEXICO CITY, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Mexico's bank regulator said on Wednesday it fined Citigroup's <C.N> Mexican unit Banamex nearly 30 million pesos (US$2.2 million) over lapses in oversight of loans to oil services company Oceanografia that cost the lender more than $500 million.

A February investigation showed the bank had failed in its prudential responsibilities and lacked adequate internal controls, Mexico's National Banking and Securities Commission said in a statement. Banamex said in a statement it had paid the fine and would follow recommendations made by regulators. Banamex said its own investigations showed that the fraud was an "exceptional" case. Citigroup <C.N>  said in February it had uncovered at least $400 million in fraudulent loans that Banamex made to Mexican oil services company Oceanografia. That figure has since increased to more than $500 million. The fine, the latest in a string of problems at the bank, comes a day after Citigroup said it had uncovered another $15 million fraud at Banamex related to a private security services company the bank operated. [ID:nL2N0S90UJ] Banamex Chief Executive Javier Arrigunaga resigned this month, to be replaced by Banamex executive Ernesto Torres.
