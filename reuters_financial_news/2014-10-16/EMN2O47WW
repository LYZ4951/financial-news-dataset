NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Oct 15 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $22.6 billion to $1.061 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $10.1 billion to $1.028 trillion.
