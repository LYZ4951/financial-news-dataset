HYDERABAD, India, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said India is seeing a pick-up in economic growth although more could be done to support that on a sustainable basis, while noting inflation was also easing.

"The bottom line is we do seem to be picking up on growth and inflation is easing," he told students at a business school in Hyderabad in southern India.
