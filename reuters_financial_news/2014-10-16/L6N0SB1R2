KIEV, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's mission to Ukraine will determine at the end of October how much additional financial aid Kiev needs, central bank Governor Valeria Gontareva said on Thursday.

"The IMF mission which will arrive in late October will determine the demand in real terms," Gontareva said at a news conference.
