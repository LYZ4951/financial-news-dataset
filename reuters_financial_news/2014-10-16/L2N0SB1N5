TORONTO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management said on Thursday that Canadian Pacific Railway's <CP.TO> chief executive believes some consolidation in the rail industry could improve competition.

Speaking at a Toronto event, William Ackman said it was not his role to confirm or deny rumors that CP, Canada's second-largest rail carrier, had made a move to acquire U.S. rail company CSX Corp <CSX.N>.
