OSLO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Nordic brokerage ABG Sundal Collier's <ASC.OL> 2014 dividend will be at least as high as last year's, Chief Executive Officer Knut Brundtland told a news conference following the release of the company's third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

"We have higher earnings per share in 2014 than we did in 2013, so under no circumstances will we pay less than 0.50 crowns in dividend," Brundtland said. The company's third-quarter revenues and earnings rose from the same period last year, but by 0750 GMT the ABG share traded down 0.4 percent in Oslo. [ID:nFWN0SA04G]
