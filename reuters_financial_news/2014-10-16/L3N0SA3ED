BANGKOK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK>, Thailand's third-largest lender by assets, said on Thursday its third quarter net profit rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier, fuelled chiefly by higher fee income, falling costs and and a lower provision.

The bank posted July-September net profit of 13.25 billion baht ($408 million), slightly lower than the 13.4 billion baht average forecast of nine analysts polled by Reuters. This compared with 12.7 billion baht a year earlier.SCB, which is 23.7 percent owned by the investment arm of the Thai royal family, aimed for loan growth of 5 percent this year and continues to focus on cutting funding costs amid weak lending demand in a slowing economy.
