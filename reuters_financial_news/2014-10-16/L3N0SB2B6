SEOUL, Oct 16 (Reuters) - South Korean shares finished at an 8-month low on Thursday, as soft U.S economic data triggered fresh concerns over global growth although bargain hunting helped to pare losses.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> shed 0.37 percent to close at 1,918.83 points, its lowest since Feb. 6. The index fell as much as 1.1 percent in early trade. The South Korean won <KRW=> edged higher on short-covering as the dollar turned bearish on dashed expectations of an early rate hike by the U.S Federal Reserve.
