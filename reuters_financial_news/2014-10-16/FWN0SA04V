MUNICH, Oct 16 (Reuters) - BayernLB does not expect to face any problems in the upcoming balance sheet health checks led by the European Central Bank, despite an ongoing dispute with Austria over wind-down costs for nationalised Austrian bank Hypo Alpe Adria.

"Stress test, no, no problem," BayernLB Chief Executive Johannes-Joerg Riegler told journalists on Thursday. Turning to possible costs threatened by Hypo Alpe Adria [AAIM.UL], he said, "We're not talking about an existential threat here." BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] on Wednesday said it would file a lawsuit against a law Austria passed this year that forces some creditors to share the costs of winding down Hypo Alpe Adria. [ID:nL6N0SA1IP] It is the first lawsuit against the law, which entered uncharted territory for debt markets by wiping out subordinated debt worth nearly 900 million euros ($1.14 billion) despite guarantees from Hypo's home province of Carinthia.
