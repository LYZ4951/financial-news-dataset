PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European shares reversed an early rebound and dropped again on Thursday morning, resuming their month-long sell-off as worries over the strength of the global economy and fears of deflation in the euro zone kept investors on edge.

At 0750 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.3 percent at 1,248.65 points, following on from a 3.2 percent slump on Wednesday.
