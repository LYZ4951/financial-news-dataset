MOSCOW, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Thursday it would introduce new foreign currency repos at the end of the month in dollars and euros to help banks manage their short-term foreign currency liquidity.

The bank said in a statement: "The aggregate maximum amount of debt on repo transactions in foreign currency is set by the Bank of Russia in the amount equivalent to $50 billion for the period until the end of 2016."
