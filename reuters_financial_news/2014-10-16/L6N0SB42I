CAIRO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday, when the bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar.

The price was unchanged from Wednesday's sale. In the unofficial market, the pound was trading at 7.45 to the dollar, weaker than Wednesday's rate of 7.40 to the dollar, one trader said. The rate for dollar sales has stayed in a tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. The central bank offered $40 million on Thursday.
