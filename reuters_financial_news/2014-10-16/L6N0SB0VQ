AMSTERDAM, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Dutch insurer Aegon <AEGN.AS> announced on Thursday it would sell its Canadian life business to Bermuda-based reinsurer Wilton Re Holdings, saying the decision to leave a market where it was not a leader would improve the company's return on equity.

The company said it would use the C$600 million ($532 million) proceeds of the sale to reduce debt by redeeming a 500 million dollar bond which had been due in December 2015. Aegon said the combination of the sale and the debt reduction would improve Aegon's return on equity by 0.4 percentage points while reducing net underlying earnings by less than 1 percent. The sale price implies a multiple of 23 times net underlying earnings, the company said, with the Canadian business making a net profit of C$26 million in the 12 months to June 2014. "We continually review the performance of our business to ensure that they support our ambition to become a leader in our chosen markets," said Aegon chief executive Alex Wynaendts in a statement. "We have concluded that our Canadian life insurance business does not support that goal."
