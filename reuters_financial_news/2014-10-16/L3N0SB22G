BANGKOK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets mostly fell on Thursday, with Singapore touching the lowest since March and Malaysia at its weakest in more than eight months, amid heightened concerns about global economic growth after weak U.S. data.

Data released on Wednesday showed U.S. retail sales and producer prices both dropped last month, a worrisome economic signal that helped fuel a selloff on Wall Street.
