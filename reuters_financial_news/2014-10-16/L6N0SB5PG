LAGOS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it is investigating last month's price freeze on the shares of top tier lender Access Bank <ACCESS.LG> ahead of its 68 billion naira ($415 mln) rights issue.

The Nigerian Stock Exchange in September suspended the shares for a week after the bank applied to the bourse, arguing that information on its capital raising was not publicly available and that it wanted to avoid speculation in its shares. [ID:nL6N0RQ2GJ]
