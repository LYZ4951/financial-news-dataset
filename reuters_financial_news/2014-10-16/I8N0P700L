MUMBAI, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Thursday as companies seen most exposed to the global economy such as Hindalco Industries <HALC.NS> and Sesa Sterlite <SESA.NS> declined tracking a downturn in global markets.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed lower 1.39 percent at 25,983.05, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 1.47 percent down at 7,748.20.
