MEXICO CITY, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Mexico's banking regulator on Thursday said it was investigating a security services unit at Citigroup's <C.N> troubled Mexican unit Banamex, after the bank revealed a $15 million fraud at the subsidiary earlier this week.

The fraud, revealed by Citigroup on Tuesday, was related to expense claims submitted to the bank by the security unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The unit was originally set up to protect Banamex board members and their families from kidnappers and other attackers. [ID:nL2N0S90UJ] Jaime Gonzalez, President of Mexico's banking regulator, the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, said the agency was investigating the unit for possible administrative violations and had asked for more information from the bank. The Attorney General's office would be responsible for a possible criminal probe, the government said. Javier Laynez, the fiscal prosecutor in the finance ministry, said the bank had on Oct. 2 informed authorities of the possible irregularities, who had passed on the information to the public prosecutor's office on Oct. 6 and 7. Citigroup has said it notified and was cooperating with U.S. and Mexican law enforcement and regulators about the issue.
