WELLINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar briefly slipped to a session low on Friday, but quickly recouped its losses amid market speculation that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had warned against strength in the domestic currency.

The kiwi <NZD=D4> fell roughly half a cent to $0.7878, before recovering to around $0.7930 when market participants acknowledged that an announcement on changes to the RBNZ's currency basket did not contain a statement on currency strength. [ID:nL3N0SB71S]
