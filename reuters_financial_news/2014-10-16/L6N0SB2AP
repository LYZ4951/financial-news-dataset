MADRID, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Spanish builder FCC <FCC.MC> has delayed the approval of a rights issue at a board meeting after its controlling shareholder failed to sign off on a debt restructuring deal, a source with knowledge of the matter said, pushing its shares lower.

The loss-making construction and services company hopes to raise at least 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in a rights issue of new stock to pay off some of the debts amassed during Spain's building boom, on which it is paying punitive interest rates. While the basis of the agreement was reached earlier this week, final details are still being discussed. [ID:nL6N0SA14F] Esther Koplowitz, controlling shareholder and daughter of the founder of the company, must sign off soon on the refinancing if the share issue is to be completed before the end of the year.  Shares in the company fell over 6 percent on Thursday, to 12.93 euros, their lowest level in over a year. "The lack of agreement makes for a worse scenario than the one priced in by the market yesterday, which had assumed the refinancing of the control shareholder was a done deal," said Sabadell bank in a note. Koplowitz is in parallel talks with banks to refinance around 1 billion euros of debt owed by her investment vehicle which holds more than 50 percent of FCC.  She was on the point of signing off on a restructuring deal with creditors Bankia <BKIA.MC> and BBVA <BBVA.MC> on Wednesday, sources with knowledge of the matter said, but has not done so and negotiations with lenders are continuing.  "There are some details that have not been finalised yet, but it's obvious they have to sign off in the next few days in order for the company to be able to continue with its plans," said one source with knowledge of the talks.  FCC declined to comment. The company said late on Wednesday it would call another board meeting to finalise details of the capital hike. Neither Bankia or BBVA would comment on the matter. The rights issue, heavily dilutive for a company with a stock market value of around 1.7 billion euros, will slash Koplowitz's stakeholding in the company she and her sister Alicia inherited from their father. Esther bought out her sister in 1997.
