PRAGUE, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The main index of the Prague stock exchange <.PX> dropped to its lowest level since July 2013 on Thursday, caught in a fall of other European stocks as worries mounted over the strength of the global economy. [ID:nL6N0SB2EB]

At 0957 GMT, the index was down 3.2 percent at 894.33 points, with Erste Group Bank <ERST.PR> <ERST.VI> leading losses with a 5.3 percent fall. Central Europe's largest-listed utility CEZ <CEZP.PR> dropped 3.1 percent to a more than three-month low. A dealer said Prague was harder hit than other central European bourses due to lower liquidity.  "There are geopolitical risks and also concern about a slowdown in the global economy after weak data from the United States yesterday," the dealer said.
