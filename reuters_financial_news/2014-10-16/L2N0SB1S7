SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Canaan Partners has raised a $675 million fund, the firm's tenth, amid an environment where venture funds are raising levels of cash not seen for years.

The Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm plans to stick to its strategy of investing about two-thirds of its assets in information technology and one-third in healthcare, in both cases primarily in the early stages. Current investments include LendingClub and dating-service Zoosk, both considered leading candidates for initial public offerings. It also backed Chimerix, <CMRX.O> the maker of an experimental drug that is being used to treat victims of the Ebola virus. Canaan, founded in 1987, last raised a $600 million fund in late 2011, after a $650 million fund in 2007. Last week, the National Venture Capital Association said U.S. venture firms raised $6.1 billion last quarter, bringing the total venture funding raised this year to levels unseen since before the 2008 recession.
