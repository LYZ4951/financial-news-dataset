PARIS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trading on Thursday, taking a breather following the previous session's steepest sell-off since 2011, helped by a raft of reassuring corporate results.

Shares in Swiss drugmaker Roche <ROG.VX> rose 1.7 percent after it reaffirmed its full-year sales and profit targets as a strong performance by its new breast cancer drugs helped it beat expectations in the third quarter. [ID:nFWN0SA03I] French spirits group Remy Cointreau <RCOP.PA> surged 5 percent after it confirmed its full-year targets for organic growth. [ID:nP6N0O9026] Shire <SHP.L> bucked the trend, down 11.5 percent and plummeting for a second day, after U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc <ABBV.N> recommended that shareholders vote against its $55 billion takeover of Shire in the wake of a U.S. government move to curb deals designed to cut high taxes. Shares in Shire tumbled 23 percent on Wednesday after AbbVie said it was reconsidering its bid. [ID:nL6N0SA0O5]
