HONG KONG, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Scores of Hong Kong police removed barricades early on Friday erected by pro-democracy protesters around the bustling area of Mong Kok, across the harbour from the main demonstration area next to government offices, a Reuters witness said.

The police operation was the latest to dismantle barricades after nearly three weeks of protests that have paralysed parts of the Asian financial hub.
