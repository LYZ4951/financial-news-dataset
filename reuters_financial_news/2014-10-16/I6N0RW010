MILAN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> were suspended from trading early on Thursday and other mid-sized banks were also trading lower, extending losses after a big fall in the previous session.

Monte dei Paschi shares were indicated down 3.4 percent,Carige <CRGI.MI> was down 4.4 percent, Popolare Emilia Romagna <EMII.MI> fell 3.4 percent.  One trader said Monte dei Paschi and other banks which were perceived as having a weaker balance sheet ahead of the outcome of a Europe-wide health check of lenders on Oct. 26 were being hit harder. "There is a general aversion to risk, the banks are being hit across the board but those seen as being more vulnerable ones suffer more," the trader said.
