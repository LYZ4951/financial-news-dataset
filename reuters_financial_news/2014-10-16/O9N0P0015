OSLO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Norway's banks expect somewhat higher household credit demand in the fourth quarter and see unchanged credit demand from non-financial corporations, the central bank said in a quarterly survey on lending.

Banks also expect both corporate and household lending margins to fall in the quarter, though see no change in overall credit standards.
