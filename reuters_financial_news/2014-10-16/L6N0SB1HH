LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The British Bankers' Association (BBA), the lobby group for more than 240 UK and overseas firms, held its annual conference on Thursday, attended by politicians, regulators and bank executives and other staff.

Here are selected comments from the conference:  CATHY JAMIESON, OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY SHADOW FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO TREASURY: "There has been a lot of pressure put on banking by the politicians of all parties, but that is because of the problems that were there and emerged. If there was wrongdoing people have to take the consequences of that. The scale of fines is for the regulators. "Those fines will be avoided in the future by people in banking taking responsibility, changing the culture and doing business differently, and also for us politicians to ensure that there is a tight regulatory structure there."  ANTHONY BROWNE, BBA CHAIRMAN: "We also need to change how bank staff work today - by changing the culture of banking. Because true change can only come from within. This is essential if we are to win back the trust and confidence of our customers. "Much of the action taken since the crisis has been good. But some of it has had unwelcome unintended consequences, such as the fragmentation of the global banking system, the balkanization of capital and liquidity and the differing, sometimes conflicting regulatory regimes across the world."
