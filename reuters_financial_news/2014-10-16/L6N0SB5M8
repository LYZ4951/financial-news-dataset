MADRID, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Spain's High Court on Thursday imposed a 16-million-euro bail to ex-chief executive officer of former savings bank Caja Madrid Miguel Blesa over the alleged use of company credit cards for personal expenses, a spokeswoman for the court said.

Ex-International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato, also involved in the case for his role at the helm of Bankia <BKIA.MC>, was asked to deposit a 3-million-euro bail.
