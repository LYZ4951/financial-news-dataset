MILAN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Italy's market regulator Consob has decided to ban short selling in shares of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> during the Friday session after heavy losses on Thursday breached a 10 percent threshold.

Shares in Italy's third-biggest bank slumped to an all-time low on Thursday as fears it could fail European industry "stress tests" combined with a fraught global economic backdrop to hit the sector.[ID:nL6N0SB24J] "The measure will be in force during tomorrow's trading session on Friday, Oct. 17, until 2400 (2200 GMT)," the regulator said in a statement on its website.
