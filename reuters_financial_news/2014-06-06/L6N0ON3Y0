PARIS, June 6 (Reuters) - Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> denied having any interest in acquiring Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> after a magazine report that France's second-biggest listed bank and Spain's Santander <SAN.MC> were mulling a tie-up with the German bank.    "Societe Generale denies any discussions related to a possible acquisition of Commerzbank," a Societe Generale spokeswoman said in an email on Friday.
