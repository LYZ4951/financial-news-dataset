June 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned China Vanke Co., Ltd's <000002.SZ> (Vanke; BBB+/Stable) USD400m 4.50% senior unsecured notes due in 2019 a final  rating of 'BBB+'. The notes are issued by Bestgain Real Estate Lyra Limited and are jointly and  severally guaranteed by Vanke Real Estate (Hong Kong) Company Ltd (Vanke HK), a  wholly owned subsidiary of Vanke.   The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected  rating assigned on 28 May 2014.  KEY RATINGS DRIVERS Keepwell and Deed of Equity Interest: In place of a guarantee, Vanke has granted  a keepwell deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking to ensure  that the guarantor, Vanke HK, has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its  obligations under the guarantee for the medium-term note programme under which  the US dollar notes are issued. In Fitch's view, the keepwell and undertaking  deeds signal a strong intention from Vanke to honour its proposed debt  obligations. National Coverage and Large Scale: Vanke is the largest homebuilder in China's  residential market by contracted sales. It has about 400 projects for sale in 61  cities, of which over two thirds are Tier 1 and 2 cities. Its land bank of 62.7m  square metres (sqm) in GFA is well diversified and is one of the largest in  China. The large scale provides Vanke with operational and financial  flexibility. It has also moved towards using prefabricated building components  to ensure quality, quick replication, lower cost and standardisation.  Sales Growth to Slow: Vanke's contracted sales have increased strongly, with  three-year CAGR at around 27%-30% since 2007. In 2013, CAGR dropped to 16.5%.  Fitch expects Vanke's growth in contracted sales to slow down due to more  intense competition and a larger base effect. Three-year CAGR for contracted  sales is likely to be around 15%-25% in the short to medium term. Lower Margins and Higher Churn: Vanke's EBITDA margins dropped to 21.9% in 2013  from 26.5% in 2012, in line with narrower margins in the sector. The decline was  due to the sales from over 90% of furbished units (completed homes that had  cabinetry and other fixtures installed) being recognised in 2013, compared with  80% in 2012. In addition, sales from the residential units sold in the market  trough in the second half of 2011 are also starting to be recognised. Vanke  follows a high asset churn strategy. As a result, its contracted sales to total  debt ratio was at 2.1x in 2013 and has been above 1.75x since 2009, making its  ratio one of the highest among peers in the sector. Fitch expects Vanke's EBITDA  margins to remain at 20%-22% in the next two to three years as it continues with  its high churn strategy and because sales are recognised from a higher  proportion of furbished units and from more units sold during the market trough.  Focus on Mass Market: Vanke continued to focus on the mass-market segment in  2013, with units smaller than 144 sqm accounting for around 91.5% of residential  units in 2013. This allowed Vanke to continue to meet demand from China's  urbanisation trend and maintain its large scale and market leadership. By  focusing on the mass-market segment, Vanke achieved CAGR of 28% for contract  sales from 2009 to 2013 despite strict home purchase restrictions imposed in  first-tier and some major second-tier cities in China.  Higher Funding Cost: Vanke's average funding cost in 2013 was around 7%-8%,  higher than the 3%-6% for other Chinese homebuilders rated in the 'BBB' category  (those rated 'BBB-', 'BBB' and 'BBB+'), which are mostly state-owned  enterprises. Vanke is privately owned and does not have that advantage. To  improve its funding cost and capital structure, Vanke issued a 2.625% USD800m  five-year offshore bond and set up a USD2bn multi-currency medium-term note  program in 2013.  Diversification Into Other Markets and Businesses: During 2013, Vanke expanded  into homebuilding overseas, including in Hong Kong, US and Singapore via joint  ventures with well-known local developers. Vanke also invested about USD400m in  Huishang Bank's IPO for a 8% stake. However, these remain insignificant, with  the above investments forming around 1% of Vanke's total assets of CNY479.5bn at  end-2013.  Outlook Stable: Fitch expects that Vanke will maintain its leadership in the  Chinese residential homebuilding market, with a clear focus on first-time  homebuyers and upgraders. Vanke will use its operational and financial  flexibility and continue to grow at a moderate pace in the highly competitive  and cyclical Chinese property market.  RATING SENSITIVITIES:  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Unfavourable changes to China's regulation or economy leading to a decline in  contracted sales; or  - Decline in EBITDA margin to below 20% (2013: 21.9%); or  - Increase in net debt/adjusted inventory to above 30% over a sustained period  (2013: 18.5%) - Contracted sales/total debt remaining below 1.75x over a sustained period  (2013: 2.1x) - Deviation from its current focus on mass-market housing
