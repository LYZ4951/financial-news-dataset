LISBON, June 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank, Banco Espirito Santo (BES)<BES.LS>, rose up to 5 percent on Friday on optimism over the bank's rights issue and new rules by the government on fiscal credits for the sector, traders said.

At 1215 GMT, shares in BES were 4.04 percent higher at 1.108 euros a share, while the rights offer is priced at 0.65 euros. The Lisbon market's main PSI20 index <.PSI20> was up 1.42 percent. "BES continues to recover, with optimism over the capital increase together with the news on the fiscal credits which is helping the banking sector in general," said Jose Novo, a trader at brokers OreyFinancial in Lisbon. Shares in Millennium bcp <BCP.LS>, BES's main competitor, rose 2.11 percent to 0.2034 euros a share. Stock in Portugal's third largest listed bank, Banco BPI <BBPI.LS>, rose 1.26 percent to 1.767 euros a share. The government approved this week a long-awaited reform to turn deferred taxes into fiscal credits, boosting the sector's capital ratios. Traders say demand for BES shares has been solid despite financial irregularities at a holding company of the Espirito Santo banking family, which controls BES. Concerns surrounding the rights issues started when BES warned of "reputational" risks to the bank due to irregularities at one of the holding companies - Espirito Santo International. The worries have focused on the fact that BES sold debt issued by Espirito Santo International through its branch network to retail clients. [ID:nL6N0OF4MY]
