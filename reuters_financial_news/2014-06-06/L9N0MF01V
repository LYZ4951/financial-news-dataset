LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde ruled herself out as a potential candidate for the job of European Commission president, saying she intended to see out her term in charge of the International Monetary Fund.

"I'm not a candidate and the reason I'm not a candidate is that I have a job," Lagarde said in response to a question at a news conference in London.
