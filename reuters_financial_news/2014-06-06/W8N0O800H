WARSAW, June 6 (Reuters) - A stronger zloty poses a bigger risk for Poland than a weaker currency, Polish Deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk was quoted as saying by the state news agency PAP on Friday.

The zloty rose by almost 2 percent against the euro in the last three weeks on expectations the European Central Bank would cut rates and introduce new measures to boost the euro zone economy.
