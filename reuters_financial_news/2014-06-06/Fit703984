June 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed RUEGEN EINS's  EUR713.4m class A secured floating-rate notes (ISIN: DE000A0Z2MT6) due 2039 at  'AAAsf' with a Negative Outlook. The transaction is a cash securitisation of loans to primarily German SMEs  originated and serviced by Commerzbank AG <CBKG.DE> (A+/Negative/F1+).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the available credit protection, which in Fitch's view  is sufficient to provide for expected losses in the 'AAAsf' rating scenario.  Reported defaults have been low - only 0.23% cumulative default rate as a  percentage of initial portfolio balance since closing of the deal in December  2009. This is because the originator has supported the transaction by  repurchasing all defaulted assets. The current pool (30 April 2014 pool cut)  contains no defaulted assets, as they were repurchased by Commerzbank after  having been reported as defaulted. The transaction's revolving period ended in June 2013. The deal began amortising  in September 2013, which has led to an increase in credit enhancement for the  class A notes to currently 35.5% (from 25% at the last review 12 months ago).  However, portfolio concentration in terms of singular obligor groups has  substantially increased. According to the 30 April 2014 pool tape, the share of  obligor groups exceeding 0.50% of the portfolio is 43%, as opposed to 20% at  last review. In Fitch's view, such large obligors add concentration risk to the  portfolio and this is the primary driver of the Negative Outlook. Fitch applied its portfolio credit model to assess the portfolio. The agency  mapped the originator's internal ratings to Fitch's one-year probability of  default by using the originator's internal rating migration tables and balance  sheet distribution. The agency assumed an annual average bank book default rate  of 1.8%. In line with its criteria, the agency applied additional stress to  obligor groups larger than 0.50%. During the revolving period, the originator had the possibility of slicing a  loan in parts and selling a part of the loan to the transaction. In the case of  a partial sale, the parts are amortised pro rata and pari passu.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
