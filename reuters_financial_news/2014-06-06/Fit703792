June 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded India-based  Vedanta Resources Plc's <VED.L> (Vedanta) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB'  from 'BB+'. The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also downgraded Vedanta's  senior unsecured ratings to 'BB-' from 'BB'. A full list of rating actions is at  the end of this commentary. Fitch has subsequently withdrawn the ratings as Vedanta has chosen to stop  participating in the rating process. Therefore, Fitch will no longer have  sufficient information to maintain the ratings. Accordingly, Fitch will no  longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for Vedanta. The downgrade follows a revision in the agency's approach in rating Vedanta and  resolves the Watch Negative that was placed on the rating on 15 May 2014. Fitch  has analysed Vedanta's financial profile based on proportionate debt and EBITDA  to better reflect the fragmented shareholding of Vedanta in its subsidiaries.  The fragmented shareholding restricts the level of Vedanta's access to the large  cash balances and future cash flows from the its key operating subsidiaries -  Cairn India Limited <CAIL.NS> (CIL), Hindustan Zinc Limited <HZNC.NS> (HZL) and Sesa Sterlite  Limited <SESA.NS> (SS).   KEY RATING DRIVERS Weak Proportionate Consolidated Financial Profile: The financial profile of  Vedanta is weak relative to 'BB+' rated peers with proportionate leverage  (proportionate net debt/ proportionate EBITDA) of 5.5x as at end-March 2014.  Vedanta's consolidated net debt/ EBITDA of 1.8x does not capture the leakages of  cash to minority shareholders at its subsidiaries. Most of Vedanta's USD9bn of  cash is at HZL (USD4.3bn) and CIL (USD4bn). With Vedanta's effective holding of  only 37.8% and 34.3% respectively at these entities, the effective cash  available to Vedanta is likely to amount to only about one-third of the total  cash in the group. While the cash available to Vedanta by way of dividends is  limited, it does provide additional short-term liquidity to the group. The IDR  also factors in Vedanta's ability to access cash from SS without any leakages to  the extent of the inter-company loan receivables by Vedanta (amounting to  USD4.3bn as at 31 March 2014). Weak Standalone Interest Cover: Vedanta's standalone interest cover (from  dividend and interest income) is expected to be weak at 0.72x as at end-March  2014.  The interest on the inter-company loan receivables from SS and its  subsidiaries and dividends from SS are not adequate to meet the company's  interest obligations. The company meets its interest obligation from the  inter-company advances repaid by its group companies. This is likely to continue  over the next two financial years. However, this is counterbalanced by Vedanta's  access to unutilised bank lines of USD500m and access to cash by way of  dividends or intercompany loans and/or advances.  Adding to Stakes in Subsidiaries: Vedanta plans to acquire additional shares in  its subsidiaries HZL and BALCO Ltd. This follows the government of India's plan  to sell its shares in these entities through an auction. Acquiring the stakes  will remove the cash leakages from HZL and benefit the company in the long term,  although the increase in net debt by about USD4bn (as approved by the  shareholders) for the acquisition will mitigate any benefits in the near to  medium term. This is reflected in Fitch's expectation of improvement in  Vedanta's proportionate leverage to below 5x only in the financial year ending  March 2016 (FY16).  Regulatory Risks Continue: Vedanta continues to face regulatory challenges  primarily at its operations in India.  Vedanta's copper and iron ore mining  operations improved during FY14 with commencement of its copper smelting  operations and iron ore mining at its Karnataka mines. In addition, the Indian  Supreme Court allowed Vedanta to start mining operations in Goa in April 2014.  However, Fitch expects the process for securing other regulatory approvals  relating to mining in Goa to continue impact the company in the near term. The  company's aluminium business continues to be constrained by the lack of captive  mining and pending approvals for use of the group's power project in Orissa for  its aluminium business.  Low Cost Position in Key Businesses: Vedanta will continue to benefit from its  strong market position, driven by long reserve life and low cost curves in some  of its key businesses. The company ranks in the lowest cost quartile in the  zinc, iron ore and oil businesses while it is in the second quartile of the cost  curve for aluminium.   Senior Unsecured Rating: Fitch has notched down the senior secured rating from  the IDR by one notch. The notching is in view of significant debt at Vedanta and  non-direct recourse to the profits and assets of the producing entities under  SS. Further the existence of significant prior ranking debt at Vedanta's  operational subsidiaries also limits the extent of access to the profits and  assets.
