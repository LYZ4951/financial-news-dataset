MILAN, June 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siene <BMPS.MI> were halted limit down in early trading on Friday after the Tuscan lender priced its upcoming 5-billion euro ($6.81 billion) rights issue at a big discount.

The bank said late on Thursday it would offer new shares in the bank at 1 euro each, or a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical share price accounting for the dilution of the new shares. [nL6N0OM5U2]
