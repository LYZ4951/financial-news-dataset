June 6 (Reuters) - WL Ross Holding Corp, a special purpose acquisition company set up by billionaire Wilbur Ross, raised $435 million in an initial public offering of common units.

The company said its offering of 43.5 million units was priced at $10 per unit. [ID:nPn6VfQDZ] Each unit comprises one share and one warrant to buy half a share.  This is the third IPO this year of a so-called "blank check" company, set up for an eventual merger or other business tie-up. Ross's stake in the company has been diluted to about 20 percent after the offering.  Deutsche Bank Securities and BofA Merrill Lynch were the lead underwriters for the offering.
