June 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Euro-denominated money market funds have already taken  investment and operational measures to prepare for yields declining or even  turning negative, should short-term money market rates shift in that direction  following the European Central Bank's decision to cut the rate on its deposit  facility to minus 10bp, Fitch Ratings says.  Euro constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs adopted structural share class changes  following the cut in the ECB deposit rate to zero in July 2012. The changes  allow them to maintain a stable net asset value per share should a fund suffer a  negative net yield.  Euro MMFs also updated their investment objectives to  introduce the concept of relativity to prevailing money market rates. Yesterday's ECB negative deposit rate move and cut in the main refinancing rate  of 10bp to 0.15%, effective 11 June, is likely to push MMF yields back to near  zero levels. MMF net yields had ticked up to reach 18bp on average at end-May  across euro CNAV MMFs, from a trough in February 2013 at 2bp.  The cut in the ECB's deposit rate will push the Euro overnight index average  (Eonia) lower, but the risk of MMF yields turning negative is lower now than 18  months ago, when the eurozone liquidity was under stress. A flight to quality to  core Europe from the periphery resulted in negative short-term market rates for  highest quality issuers during this period. Current market rate levels means  that most MMFs do not anticipate difficulties placing short-term cash.  MMFs are likely to continue to look for yield-picking investment opportunities  with longer dated assets, taking advantage of the steeper yield curves since  end-2013. Euro MMFs have increased their allocation to assets with maturity of  more than three months, during the first five months of the year. This move was  most pronounced in May as most funds anticipated the ECB rate cut. MMFs'  portfolios average lives extended to 58 days on average at end-May 2014, ten  days longer than at the beginning of the year. Should Euro MMFs post negative yields resulting from short-term market rate  moves, this would not be a negative for MMF ratings by itself, including  'AAAmmf'. MMF yields have to reflect prevailing safety and liquidity costs,  commensurate with alternative high quality short-term instruments. Fitch's MMF  ratings are a ranking of funds on the basis of their liquidity, market and  credit risk profiles. It is unknown how investors will react to the likely decline of MMF yields in  the current less risk-averse market environment. They may elect to switch to  higher yielding products, trading off liquidity, spread sensitivity and credit  quality for higher yields.
