June 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The UK government's plan to introduce collective pension  funds is likely to be modestly negative for the insurance sector, Fitch Ratings  says. But the scale of the impact will depend on how the plans are implemented  and the level of demand. Collective pension funds pool the assets of many thousands of employees to cut  costs and spread risk. They pay pensioners directly from fund assets, rather  than providing retirees with their own pension pot that they can use to buy an  annuity or invest elsewhere. The funds are common in the Netherlands and  Denmark, but the UK government has not revealed whether it plans to copy these  existing models or what role insurance companies will be able to play. Even if insurers are able to enter the collective pension funds market, they are  likely to be in competition with other asset managers for the new business.  Combined with the potential for some existing pension assets to be switched to  the new scheme, this will probably weigh on assets under management in the  insurance sector. This fall in assets under management among insurers could be partially offset if  the creation of a new option for pension investment attracts new money, pushing  up assets across the pension sector as a whole. But any impact is likely to be  small compared with the requirement to auto-enrol employees into a pension  scheme, which the government is already rolling out.
