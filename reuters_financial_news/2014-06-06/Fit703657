June 6 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Delamare Master Issuer plc's  series 2014-1 notes, backed by UK credit card receivables originated by Tesco  Personal Finance plc [TSCOE.UL] (TPF), final ratings as follows: GBP150m Series 2014-1 A1: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP350m Series 2014-1 A2: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable  Fitch has also affirmed the four outstanding Fitch-rated tranches of the  Delamare master trust programme, as follows:  GBP400m Series 2013-1 A1: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP300m Series 2013-1 A2: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP300m Series 2013-1 A3: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable GBP300m Series 2013-1 A4: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS Sound Asset Performance The charge-off and payment rate performance of the Delamare pool has  historically been better than Fitch's base case assumptions of 5% and 40%,  respectively. Fitch has maintained the charge-off base case at 5% but revised  the payment rate base case downward to 35% from 40% to account for recent  declines and expected further deterioration in payment rates following additions  to the receivables pool.Shift in Portfolio Composition New accounts originated since 2013 were added to the trust in March 2014 and  more were designated at closing of the 2014-1 series. These accounts have a  relatively higher outstanding balance per account and include balance transfers.  They therefore slightly increase the trust's risk profile. Fitch does not  consider the change material enough to warrant an adjustment to the charge-off  base case and has maintained it at 5.0%.  Interchange Cap Impact Fitch expects regulatory pressure on interchange fees and therefore has not  given full credit to interchange revenue when setting its base case yield  assumption (as per its Global Credit Card ABS Rating Criteria). Further EU  regulation is expected to reduce the cap on interchange fees to 0.3% (the  current UK level is 0.9%) of the transacted amount and this is expected to come  into force within the next two years in the UK. Delamare's high payment rate and  low charge-off rates make the portfolio more dependent on interchange fees than  its competitors. Fitch factored this in when setting the steady state portfolio  yield.  Class D Variable Funding Note The series 2013-1 D note, which was retained by the seller, has been replaced by  the series 2014-1 D note, issued as a variable funding note (VFN). This provides  subordination to all senior classes of notes. The class D principal amount may  vary after closing, subject to satisfaction of issuance and repayment tests,  which include required subordination and minimum seller share conditions.  Replacing the fixed amount series 2013-1 D with the VFN will provide operational  flexibility to the programme when a senior class is issued or redeemed.  Importance of Reward Scheme  The strong payment and purchase rates of the Delamare trust are driven by Tesco  Clubcard points-based loyalty scheme. This makes the performance of the  portfolio dependent on the continuity and attractiveness of the rewarding  mechanism.  Steady Asset Outlook The performance of credit card trusts continued to improve throughout 1Q14, with  delinquency and payment rates improving, while charge-off and yield rates were  stable over the same period.  Fitch believes UK credit card performance will remain fairly stable, with only  limited rises in delinquencies and charge-offs towards 2015. Fitch forecasts  annual UK unemployment rates for 2014 and 2015 to decline slightly to 6.9% and  6.5%, respectively. Unemployment is the key factor that determines consumers'  ability to meet payments on their credit agreements. Fitch therefore maintains  its stable outlook for the sector.
