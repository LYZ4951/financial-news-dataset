COPENHAGEN, June 6 (Reuters) - The Danish central bank said on Friday it kept interest rates unchanged, a day after the European Central Bank cut rates.

Denmark held rates due sales of foreign currency in the market since the beginning of April, and developments in market interest rates and the Danish crown exchange rate, the central bank said in a statement.
