HONG KONG, June 6 (Reuters) - Shares of Prada SpA <1913.HK> were set to fall 2.4 percent on Friday after the Italian luxury group signalled a possible cut in its full-year guidance after first-quarter sales dropped in its main European and Asian markets.

The shares were set to open at HK$56, the lowest open since March 25. That was compared to a 0.5 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index <.HSI>.
