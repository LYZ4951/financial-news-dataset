MILAN, June 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena fell more than 1 percent in early trade on Friday after the Tuscan lender priced its upcoming 5-billion euro ($6.81 billion) rights issue at a big discount.

The bank said late on Thursday it would offer new shares in the bank at 1 euro each, or a 35.5 percent discount to the theoretical share price accounting for the dilution of the new shares.[nL6N0OM5U2]
