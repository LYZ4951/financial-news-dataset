SHANGHAI, June 6 (Reuters) - China's main money market rate fell again this week as the central bank signalled it will inject more liquidity into the banking system in response to government calls to reduce the price of money to support the slowing economy, traders said.

The government also said last week that it would lower the reserve requirement for more banks to free up additional cash for loans. [ID:nL3N0OG2WC] The weighted average of the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.16 percent at midday on Friday, down 8 basis points from last week's close. Rates of other tenors edged higher as steep falls over the past several weeks capped a further downtrend, traders said. The 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS> added 7 basis points to 3.44 percent. Before the week, the seven-day repo rate plunged 83 basis points last month while the 14-day rate tumbled 86 basis points. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected a net 73 billion yuan ($12 billion) this week through its open market operations, up from a net 20 billion yuan injection last week. It has pumped a combined net 257 billion yuan into the money markets over the past four weeks. [CN/MMT] Traders widely expect the PBOC will further inject money into the markets by resuming reverse repos in open market operations, supplemented by other similar tools such as re-lending, re-discount and short-term lending facilities (SLFs).  STRONGER EASING UNLIKELY  Money market conditions have remained much looser this year compared with the second part of last year, as the PBOC has increasingly eased its grip on liquidity given prolonged softness in China's economy, traders said. Annual economic growth slowed to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter, raising the risk that the government could miss its growth target - set at 7.5 percent in 2014 - for the first time in 15 years. "With the central bank having not yet exhausted its milder tools, it is unlikely to use stronger easing measures such as cuts in all banks' reserve requirement or interest rates for now," said a dealer at a major state-owned bank in Shanghai. Traders see money market rates remaining largely stable at the current relatively low levels in coming weeks. China's fixed-income markets have also seen a steep downtrend this year, with the benchmark five-year interest rate swap <CNYQB7R5Y=> at 3.88 percent by midday on Friday, compared with the recent peak of 5.3 percent hit on Jan. 6. The one-year IRS <CNYQB7R1Y=>, which is typically more sensitive to short-term liquidity conditions, dropped to 3.45 percent, from 5.24 percent touched on Jan. 2.
