LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Daily currency trading volumes inched up to $73.5 billion on the EBS platform <IAP.L> in May, recovering some ground after a year which has seen business cut almost in half on one of the main venues for the global market.

Volumes on the platform were still down 42 percent compared to a year earlier but were 7 percent higher than those in April, data published by EBS-owner ICAP showed.  A combination of ultra-low interest rates across the developed world and an uncertain regulatory environment have hammered volumes of trade in the spot foreign exchange market over the past year.
