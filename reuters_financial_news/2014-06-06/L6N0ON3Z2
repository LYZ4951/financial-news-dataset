LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - The acquisition of Germany-based packaging group Mauser by private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) will be backed with $1.6 billion-equivalent of leveraged loans, banking sources said on Friday.

CD&R agreed to buy Mauser last month from Dubai International Capital (DIC) for 1.2 billion euros ($1.63 billion), in what was one of the largest asset disposals by the emirate since its debt crisis in 2009.  The deal will be financed with covenant-lite senior and junior loans denominated in euros and dollars with Credit Suisse, Barclays, BNP Paribas, ING, Natixis and Nomura leading the deal. [ID: nRLP48783a] The financing will now be syndicated to other lenders and will be showcased at a bank meeting in London on June 12. Commitments are due by June 25, the banking sources said.  The financing includes $465 million and 340 million euros of seven-year, first lien loans and $405 million of eight-year, second lien loans. There is also a 150 million euro revolver and a 50 million euro capital expenditure facility, the banking sources said. CD&R beat rival bids from a number of other parties as part of an auction process, including a joint bid from buyout firm Ardian in combination with industry rival Technoplast and one from Pamplona.
