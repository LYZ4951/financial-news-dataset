MUMBAI, June 6 (Reuters) - India's main two indexes surged 1.5 percent each to mark record highs as blue-chips including oil and gas companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp rose on continued optimism about policy reforms by the new Narendra Modi government.

The NSE index <.NSEI> rose as much as 1.53 percent to mark an all-time high of 7,588.25, while the BSE index <.BSESN> touched a life high of 25,416.86. Both indexes surpassed their previous records hit on May 16, the day that Modi won overwhelmingly in the country's elections.
