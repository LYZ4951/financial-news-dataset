FRANKFURT, June 6 (Reuters) - Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> said on Friday it had considered taking a stake in German soccer club Borussia Dortmund <BVB.DE> but decided against it.

"The executive board of Deutsche Bank has decided unanimously today not to take a stake in Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund at the moment, following an appraisal process over a longer period of time," a spokesman said in a written statement. He declined to comment further. Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Friday that Deutsche was considering taking a stake or entering a marketing alliance with the soccer club.
