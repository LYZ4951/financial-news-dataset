ROME, June 6 (Reuters) - Alitalia's creditor banks have not yet concluded their discussions of the turnaround plan presented by Abu Dhabi's Etihad, a member of the board of statutory auditors said on Friday.

"The negotiations with the banks are still going on," Tommaso Di Tanno told reporters outside a board meeting of the loss-making Italian carrier.
