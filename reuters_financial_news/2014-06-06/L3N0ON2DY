June 6 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1000 GMT on Friday:

** Sprint Corp <S.N> and T-Mobile US Inc <TMUS.N> might have some fresh arguments to allay regulator skepticism about a merger, but the government may still be reluctant to approve shrinking the U.S. wireless market from four main players to three. Sprint, purchased by Japan's Softbank Corp <9984.T> in 2013, has agreed to pay about $40 per share, or over $32 billion, for T-Mobile US, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, bringing to a head a long-discussed and controversial deal to reshape the U.S. cellphone market. [ID:nL1N0OM1R4]  ** Mexican real estate investment trust (REIT) Fibra Shop Portafolios <FSHOP13.MX> said its shareholders had approved the purchase of three shopping centers in the country worth around 1.5 billion pesos ($116 million). The shopping centers belonged to U.S. REIT Kimco Realty Corp <KIM.N> and were in the states of Morelos next to Mexico City, Chiapas in the south and Sonora in the northwest, Fibra Shop said in a statement on Thursday. [ID:nL1N0ON07L]  ** The New South Wales state government has set a deadline of late July for first-round bids for two power stations ahead of a sale worth about A$1 billion ($931 million), two sources working on the deal told Reuters on Friday. Australian federal and state governments have identified some A$100 billion of state-owned assets for potential sale as they seek new ways to pay down debt and fund upgrades to critical infrastructure like roads. [ID:nL3N0ON1SH]  ** A private equity consortium led by KKR & Co LP <KKR.N> has agreed to pay about $270 million for up to 70 percent of China's COFCO Meat, a source said, targeting consumers willing to pay a premium for high quality, safe pork products. The deal underscores the trend towards food safety in China, and follows Shuanghui International's <000895.SZ> acquisition last year of U.S. firm Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] , the world's largest pork processor, to secure a supply of high quality meat. The firms announced the deal on Friday without giving financial details. [ID:nL3N0ON0EF]  ** Finnish media group Sanoma Oyj <SAA1V.HE> said on Friday that it had reached a deal to sell 19 magazine titles in the Netherlands to a local company New Skool Media. Loss-making Sanoma did not disclose the deal's value, but said annual sales of the titles totaled 38 million euros ($52 million). Sanoma said seven more titles were under review in the country. [ID:nWEB00O4D]  ** Texas's largest power provider, the bankrupt Energy Future Holdings Co [EFHC.UL], was cleared to get final approval on Thursday for about $4.5 billion in financing deals that it has said were important to maintaining its business. Judge Christopher Sontchi of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, said he would dismiss objections that the financing was overly favorable to senior creditors who would end up owning the company's generating and retail utility unit. [ID:nL1N0OM28N]  ** Independent refiner Phillips 66 <PSX.N> is buying a 7.1 million-barrel storage terminal near Beaumont, Texas, as part of the company's plan to beef up logistics and transportation assets. The terminal, now owned by Chevron Corp <CVX.N>, is nearly 60 miles from Phillips' nearest refinery, its 239,400- barrel-per-day plant in Westlake, Louisiana. [ID:nL1N0OM2PC]
