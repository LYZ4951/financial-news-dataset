BERLIN, June 6 (Reuters) - The German government has no current plans to sell its stake in Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, a spokeswoman for the finance ministry said on Friday.

The spokeswoman was asked about its plans for the stake following a report in German magazine Bilanz that said France's Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> and Spain's Banco Santander <SAN.MC> were each mulling a tie-up with Germany's second largest lender.
