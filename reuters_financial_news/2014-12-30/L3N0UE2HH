HONG KONG, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Analysts have downgraded their recommendations for Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings <1638.HK> after the latest round of staff departures and its silence on a sales block in Shenzhen plunged the company into uncertainty.

Nomura cut its stock price target to HK$1.23 from HK$4.15, while Moody's downgraded its credit rating to B3 from B1, warning of further cuts, and Standard & Poor's said its sales and operations could be "significantly affected" over the next year. [ID:nMDY8R7zYZ] The company's troubles began earlier this month when it said  authorities in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen had blocked the sale of unsold units in some of its property projects, which would have an adverse impact on its cash flow. http://bit.ly/1JFRtce A series of staff departures which sapped market confidence in the company also hurt its stock and bond prices. [ID:nL3N0UD1F9] Its shares have lost half their value to HK$1.59 before a trading was halted on Monday and its bond yields have more than trebled.  The yield on its bonds due 2018 <US48300TAB8=TE> has risen to more than 29 percent from around 9 percent at the start of the month. Moody's analyst Franco Leung said the departure of two senior executives, the chairman's resignation and the sanctions on sales imposed by Shenzhen authorities would hurt the company. He said it "will disrupt the company's operations, restrain Kaisa's ability to execute its sales plans for projects outside Shenzhen and add uncertainty over Kaisa's future corporate strategy." The agency could further cut its rating below B3 if the restrictions it faces in Shenzhen are not removed, or if the two senior positions are not filled in the next few weeks. Debt analysts have questioned the company's fund raising ability since the two executives, Vice Chairman Tam Lai Ling and Chief Financial Officer Cheung Hung Kwong, were instrumental in arranging Kaisa's offshore debt issues.
