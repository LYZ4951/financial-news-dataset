NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Puerto Rico's Doral Financial Corp <DRL.N> on Tuesday fell in mid-morning trading after news late Monday that the U.S. commonwealth will file an appeal this week in its $229 million tax dispute with the lender.

Doral's shares fell 4.8 percent to $4.35 by mid-morning. Tuesday's move followed a jump of 27 percent in the previous session on volume more than 3 times the 25-day average.
