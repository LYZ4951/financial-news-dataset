LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - British annual house price growth eased for a fourth consecutive month in December as the rate of increase cooled across 12 out of 13 British regions, a survey from mortgage lender Nationwide showed on Tuesday.

House prices rose 7.2 percent in December compared with a year earlier, following a rise of 8.5 percent in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast growth of 7.5 percent on the year.
