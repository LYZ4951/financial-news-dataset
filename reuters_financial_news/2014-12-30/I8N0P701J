MUMBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended flat on Tuesday as weaker regional shares offset optimism over additional reforms a day after the government passed an executive order to ease land-acquisition rules.

Monday's announcement could kick-start hundreds of billions of dollars worth of stalled projects, and comes after separate orders were passed to implement coal and insurance reforms. [ID:nL3N0UD2SM] However, weak sentiment across the region on a sharp selloff in commodities overnight and political uncertainty in Greece left investors hesitant to take big bets. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> gained 0.03 percent at 27,403.54 points, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 0.02 higher percent at 8,248.25 points. Infrastructure stocks gained with Larsen and Toubro <LART.NS> adding 0.5 percent while Lanco Infratech <LAIN.NS> rose 4.3 percent.
