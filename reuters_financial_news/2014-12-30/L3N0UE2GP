BANGKOK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Indonesia's main index hit a more than three-month high on Tuesday after late buying in large-caps, posting its best yearly gain since 2010, while the Thai benchmark edged lower due to losses in energy shares, though it ended the year with strong gains.

Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> rose 0.9 percent to 5,226.95, its highest close since Sept. 19. The climb was led by Astra International <ASII.JK>, Indonesia's second-biggest firm by market value, and dividend-yielding stocks such as Telekomunikasi Indonesia <TLKM.JK>. The index rose 22.3 percent in 2014 after a modest fall of 1 percent in 2013.  The rupiah's weakness <IDR=ID> due to weak economic data dented market sentiment this year, but lower oil prices are expected to help lower the current account deficit next year, a positive for the stock market, brokers said. Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> inched down 0.04 percent on the final trading day of the year. It finished 2014 with a gain of 15.3 percent, compared with a 6.7 percent loss in 2013.  PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK> fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday as Brent crude fell to a 5-1/2-year low below $57 a barrel. Analysts have downgraded the SET index target for next year due to concerns about the impact of weak oil prices on earnings of energy firms. Shares in Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> were little changed amid public holidays in the region, while Vietnam <.VNI> climbed 0.92 percent to close near its one-week high as funds boosted share prices ahead of their year-end reports.
