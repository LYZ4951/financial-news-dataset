The Hang Seng index <.HSI> fell 1.1 percent, to 23,501.10 points, posting its biggest single-day loss in two weeks. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> lost 1.5 percent, to 11,844.10 points.Among the most actively traded stocks on Hong Kong's main board were South East Group Ltd <0726.HK>, down 2.4 percent at HK$0.25, China Construction Bank <0939.HK>, down 1.4 percent at HK$6.28 and ICBC <1398.HK>, down 1.2 percent at HK$5.56.
