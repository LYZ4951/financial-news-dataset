LONDON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday, led by energy companies as Brent oil fell to a fresh 5-1/2-year low on persistent worries about a global supply glut.

Oil explorer Seadrill <SDRL.OL> was among the top fallers in the sector after saying it had exercised an option to buy drillship West Polaris from Ship Finance International Limited. [ID:nASN00060V] The STOXX Europe 600 oil & gas index <.SXEP> fell 1.4 percent at 0812 GMT, the worst performing sector index in Europe. Risk appetite was also hit by concerns about Greece, which is heading to a January general election that radical leftist Syriza party is tipped to win after parliament failed to elect a President on Monday.
