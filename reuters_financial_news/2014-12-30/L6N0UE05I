DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Selling pressure may persist in Gulf stock markets on Tuesday after oil prices dropped back to five-year lows and political uncertainty in Greece weakened global equities.

Brent oil <LCOc1> has extended its losses into a fourth session on Tuesday, with prices hovering around $57.50 per barrel, as persistent worries about a global supply glut offset concerns about output disruptions in Libya. [O/R] Although oil's fresh weakness is unlikely to trigger another panic sell-off of stocks in the Gulf - Saudi Arabia's 2015 budget, announced last week, showed government spending in the region will stay high regardless - it may affect stocks such as petrochemicals and oilfield service firms. On Monday, crude traded higher while Gulf stock markets were open, helping stocks such as Qatar's Gulf International Services <GISS.QA> and Saudi Arabia's PetroRabigh <2380.SE> outperform. They could come under pressure on Tuesday. Domestic news flow in the Gulf remains thin, giving markets no fresh catalysts for a rally. Saudi International Petrochemical Co <2310.SE> (Sipchem) may attract some investors after it said on Monday that it would start production at a new polybutylene terephthalate plant in the first quarter of 2015. However, oil price concerns may dampen interest. [ID:nL6N0UD1L6]
