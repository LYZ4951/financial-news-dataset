MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he broke his house arrest on Tuesday to join an opposition rally in Moscow, hours after a Russian court sentenced him for embezzlement.

"Yes, there is this house arrest. But today I want to be with you. So I'm coming," said Navalny said on his Twitter feed, posting a picture of himself in the Moscow metro. A Russian court gave Navalny a suspended sentence on Tuesday for embezzling money but jailed his brother for three and a half years in a case seen as part of a campaign to stifle dissent.
