MILAN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank had a 2.13 percent stake in Italian co-operative bank Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> as of Dec. 19, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.

Italian market regulator Consob said earlier this month Norges Bank had cut its stake in Banco Popolare just below 2 percent as of Dec. 11.
