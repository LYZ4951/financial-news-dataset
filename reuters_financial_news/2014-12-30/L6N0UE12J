DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Commercial Bank of Kuwait (CBK) <CBKK.KW> has cut its stake in Boubyan Bank <BOUK.KW> to 17.7 percent from the 19.9 percent which it held at its last filing in September, Kuwait Stock Exchange data showed on Tuesday.

The stake dropped to 17.7 percent on Monday, the data showed.  Trade in Boubyan shares was extremely heavy on Tuesday, with more than 94 million shares, or 4.8 percent of the bank's outstanding shares, changing hands by early afternoon. The stock price was up 1.25 percent at 0.405 dinar. National Bank of Kuwait <NBKK.KW>, the country's biggest bank, owns 58 percent of Boubyan, according to Thomson Reuters data. The identity of the buyer of CBK's holding in Boubyan was not immediately clear; spokesmen at both CBK and Boubyan could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. A Kuwaiti newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, reported earlier this month that CBK was selling some of it stake in Boubyan - bonus shares it had received in past years - through the market. It said CBK did not plan to divest all of its stake. Islamic investment firm Investment Dar [INVDA.U] has been embroiled in litigation over a stake in Boubyan which it sold to CBK in 2008, with the right to buy it back.
