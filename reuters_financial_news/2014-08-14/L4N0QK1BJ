(http://on.wsj.com/1sVF4XP)  * A large California pension manager is using complex derivatives to supercharge its bets as it looks to cover a funding shortfall and diversify its holdings. The new strategy employed by the San Diego County Employees Retirement Association is complicated and potentially risky, but officials close to the system say it is designed to balance out the fund's holdings and protect it against big losses in the event of a stock-market meltdown. (http://on.wsj.com/1q9h7t3)  * Senior Federal Reserve officials said the "repo" markets that play a fundamental role in moving money around the financial system remain unstable, raising the specter of further limits on big banks' role in the markets.

(http://on.wsj.com/VlmFZj)  * Coal imports to the United States are rising sharply even as coal mines close throughout Central Appalachia. A big reason: price. It costs $26 a ton to ship coal from Central Appalachia to power plants in Florida compared with $15 a ton to get coal from a mine in Colombia, according to research firm HIS Energy.(http://on.wsj.com/XiKvql)  * Government bond yields in the United States, Germany and the U.K. closed at their lowest levels of the year on Wednesday as bond investors are convinced major central banks will keep interest rates lower for longer to support economic growth.(http://on.wsj.com/1uuAHa3)  * Mexico on Wednesday set aside the bulk of its currently active oil fields for Petróleos Mexicanos but said private companies will be allowed to bid on four-fifths of prospective resources as the government ends the national oil firm's seven-decade monopoly.

The index reshuffling prompted investors to redirect billions of dollars to the country's local-currency-denominated debt, causing the value of Colombia's peso to surge against the dollar and this has affected exports.(http://on.wsj.com/1p8ijjK)  * Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> on Wednesday began offering a mobile-payment service and smartphone-compatible credit-card reader aimed principally at food trucks and mom-and-pop shops. The service, dubbed Local Register, enters a crowded arena, competing against similar offerings from eBay Inc's <EBAY.O>  PayPal, Square Inc and Intuit Inc <INTU.O> as well as more traditional payment systems.(http://on.wsj.com/1t0XvLM)  * T-Mobile US Inc's <TMUS.N> chief financial officer called a $15 billion takeover proposal from French wireless company Iliad SA <ILD.PA> "inadequate" on Wednesday, but hinted that his company may be open to a higher offer. (http://on.wsj.com/1nR2xVO)  * German auto-parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG's attempt to buy U.S. rival TRW Automotive Holdings Corp <TRW.N> for more than $10 billion would be the biggest deal to hit the automotive supply chain in years, but it isn't alone: auto supplier merger and acquisition has sizzled in 2014 and industry executives are hunting for more deals.

They have sent Brent crude, the benchmark for world oil prices, tumbling this week.(http://on.wsj.com/1AfiGwR)* A standstill in the nation's retail sector in July showed the U.S. economy struggling to lift off as improvement in the labor market fails to deliver stronger wage and spending growth. Retail sales last month were essentially unchanged from June after adjusting for seasonal differences, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. (http://on.wsj.com/1kCHF9L)
