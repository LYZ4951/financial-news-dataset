DUBAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Bahrain's Arab Banking Corp <ABCB.BH> (ABC) on Thursday signed to obtain a $750 million, three-year loan facility from a group of banks, expanding the facility from an originally planned $500 million.

The facility, to be arranged by HSBC <HSBA.L>, National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, Natixis <CNAT.PA> and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp <8316.T>, will pay an interest rate of 120 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor), the lender said at a signing ceremony in Dubai. The syndication was launched in an initial amount of $500 million but ultimately attracted offers of $800 million from 17 regional and international banks, ABC said in a statement. Funds from the loan will be used for general corporate lending purposes, it said.
