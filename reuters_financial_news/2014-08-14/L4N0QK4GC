HANOI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets were a mixed bag on Thursday, with the Philippines <.PSI> closing at its highest in nearly 15 months on strong buying in top telecoms firm Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co <TEL.PS>.

Philippine shares rose 1.07 percent to close at 7,061 points, a level not seen since May 29 last year, on solid volumes, Reuters data showed. PLDT, the biggest firm on the index by market value, surged 4.03 percent to 3,250 pesos ($74.5), its highest close since May 2013. The stock's weighting will be increased in the coming rebalancing of the MSCI International Philippines Price Return Index <.MIPH00000PUS>, traders said. Philippine industrial conglomerate Ayala Corp <AC.PS> also hit its record high close after reporting a 34 percent jump in net profit during January-June of 2014. [ID:nP9N0NT021] Indonesia <.JKSE> retreated 0.25 percent, having climbed to a more than one-year closing high in the previous session following its central bank's announcement of a larger-than-expected current account deficit in the second quarter. Indonesia posted a surplus in the previous three months. [ID:nL4N0QK42L] Jakarta shares are still Southeast Asia's most profitable this year, according to Reuters data. Other markets moved range-bound, with Thailand's SET Index <.SETI> dipping 0.17 percent and Singapore <.FTSTI> down 0.2 percent. Malaysia <.KLSE> and Vietnam <.VNI> finished in positive territory, closing up 0.19 percent and 0.41 percent respectively.
