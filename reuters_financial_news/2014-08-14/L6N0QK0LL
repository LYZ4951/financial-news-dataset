DUBAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Dubai's Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> said on Thursday it had not yet taken a decision on the timing of an initial public offering of its malls business, which was expected later this year.

In a statement released on the Dubai stock exchange, the firm said details of the proposed listing would be announced in "due course". The Emaar Malls Group listing is expected to raise 8 to 9 billion dirhams ($2.18-$2.45 billion), making it one of the region's largest equity offers since 2008.
