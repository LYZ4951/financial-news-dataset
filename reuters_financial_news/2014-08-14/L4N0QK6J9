Aug 14 (Reuters) - Chiquita Brands International Inc <CQB.N> rejected a takeover offer from juice maker Cutrale and investment firm and Safra Group and said it would go ahead with a deal with Irish tropical fruit company Fyffes Plc <FFY.I>.

Chiquita's shares fell 1.2 percent in after-market trading on Thursday. Cutrale and Safra offered to acquire the banana producer in a $610.5 million cash deal on Monday, two months after Fyffes struck an all-stock deal worth $526 million to acquire Chiquita. [ID:nL2N0QH0LN]
