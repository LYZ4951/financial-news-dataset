FRANKFURT, Aug 14 (Reuters) - German insurer Talanx's <TLXGn.DE> net profit fell by more than expected in the second quarter, hit by a drop in income earned from investments, while gross premiums rose slightly.

Quarterly net profit fell 19 percent to 165 million euros ($220 million), compared with a 174 million euro average of forecasts in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages. [ID:nL6N0QH3FM] Net profit was 204 million euros in the same quarter last year, helped by investment income gains from the sale of shares in insurer Swiss Life <SLHN.VX>.
