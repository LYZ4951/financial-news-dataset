NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended Aug 13 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $1.7 billion to $1.037 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $9.1 billion to $1.039 trillion.
