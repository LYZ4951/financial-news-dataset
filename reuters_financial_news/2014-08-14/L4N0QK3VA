SHANGHAI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - China's capital of Beijing will issue a total of 10.5 billion yuan ($1.71 billion) of five-, seven- and 10-year municipal bonds on Aug. 21, a website for major Chinese bond issues showed. (www.chinabond.com.cn)

Beijing city is the eighth local government to issue municipal bonds. Late in May, the Ministry of Finance said 10 local governments had been given quotas to issue a combined 109.2 billion yuan of municipal bonds this year. [ID:nB9N0NA02D] The ministry has also allowed selected local governments to directly issue and redeem their own bonds to help tackle a$3-trillion public debt problem, launching China's first-ever municipal bond market. Governments in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, Qingdao, Ningxia and Jiangxi are included in the pilot scheme.
