FRANKFURT, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank sees "heightened" geopolitical risks to the euro zone's outlook for growth, it reiterated in its monthly bulletin on Thursday, stressing that it stands ready to do more if necessary.

As usual, the editorial of the bank's bulletin was virtually identical to its main policy statement, read out by ECB President Mario Draghi last Thursday when the ECB decided to keep interest rates unchanged at record low levels. "Heightened geopolitical risks, as well as developments in emerging market economies and global financial markets, may have the potential to affect economic conditions negatively, including through effects on energy prices and global demand for euro area products," the ECB said in its monthly report. The ECB said interest rates would remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation, but it would step in should it become necessary. "The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation," the bulletin said.  Below is a list of articles and special sections the bulletin contains. The articles can often shed light on the ECB's thinking about key issues and give an insight into the type of analysis the bank uses to support its policy decisions.  * Experience with foreign currency liquidity-providing   central bank swaps  * New international standards in statistics - enhancements   to methodology and data availability * The introduction of the euro in Lithuania on 1 January 2015 * The results of the euro area bank lending survey for the   second quarter of 2014  * Integrated euro area accounts for the first quarter of   2014  * House prices and the rent component of the HICP in the   euro area * Results of the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters forthe third quarter of 2014 * A new indicator on euro area capacity utilisation inservices
