ATHENS, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Piraeus Bank <BOPr.AT>, Greece's second-largest lender by assets, agreed to sell its ATE Insurance business to Ergo Insurance Group, a subsidiary of German reinsurer Munich Re <MUVGN.DE>, for 90.1 million euros ($120 million) in cash.

The sale is part of Piraeus Bank's restructuring plan, which aims at divesting non-core assets to bolster the lender's capital position. Piraeus Bank is majority owned by Greece's bank bailout fund HFSF.  "Piraeus Bank has made a significant step forward in executing its strategy to gradually exit non-banking activities," the bank's deputy CEO Anthimos Thomopoulos said in a statement on Thursday.
