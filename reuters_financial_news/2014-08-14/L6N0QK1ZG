LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Private equity firm AAC Capital UK is looking to sell kettle safety firm Strix in a deal that could value the company at $500 million and draw interest from private equity and Chinese buyers, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

AAC, the former UK private equity arm of ABN Amro, has hired Lazard to sell Strix Investments Ltd, which is headquartered in the Isle of Man but has offices in Belgium, Russia, China and Hong Kong.  Lazard is expected to kick off the auction at the end of the month, said two of the sources on Thursday, who could not be named as they were not authorized to talk to media.
