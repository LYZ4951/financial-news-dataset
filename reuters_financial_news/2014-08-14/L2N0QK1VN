NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve bought $7.870 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities in the week from Aug. 7 to Aug. 13, more than the $7.648 billion purchased the previous week, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said on Thursday.

In a program that began in October 2011 to help the housing market recover, the U.S. central bank has been using funds from principal payments on the agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, it holds to reinvest in agency MBS. The New York Fed said on its website the Fed sold $200 million in mortgage securities guaranteed by mortgage finance sources Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB>, Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> or the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, in the latest week. It sold none the prior week.
