BUDAPEST, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Hungary's OTP Bank on Friday posted a second-quarter net loss of 153.15 billion forints ($655.47 million), its deepest quarterly loss on record, as provisioning for losses at home and in Ukraine caused the bank to sink deep into the red.

OTP, which turned a 109 billion forint operating profit in the quarter, in line with recent quarters, set aside 176.1 billion forints from its bottom line as it prepared for a Hungarian government measure that forces banks to refund loan clients, the bank said in a statement posted on the Budapest Stock Exchange website. The bank also wrote down its entire goodwill in Ukraine and raised its non-performing loan coverage to 90 percent in Crimea, which hit its bottom line by a combined 20 billion forints.
