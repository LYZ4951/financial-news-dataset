BHUBANESWAR, India, Aug 14 (Reuters) - India's central bank is in talks with market participants to simplify the process of investing into the country's debt market, deputy governor H.R. Khan said on Thursday, responding to questions about international settlement of securities through Euroclear.

On Wednesday, Reuters reported India was considering joining Euroclear, the world's largest securities settlement system, with the condition that only long-term foreign investors trade Indian government debt for now. [ID:nL4N0QJ489]
