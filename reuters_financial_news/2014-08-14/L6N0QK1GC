LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - European stocks opened lower on Thursday as disappointing economic output data from the euro zone's two largest economies cast shadows on market bets on an economic recovery in the currency bloc.

At 0703 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was down 0.3 percent at 1,322.16 points, with Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and France's CAC <FCHI> down 0.4 percent each. The German economy suffered a surprise contraction, its first in more than a year, in the three months to June and France slashed its growth forecasts for this year and the next after its economy failed to grow in the second quarter.
