Aug 14 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's electric power authority PREPA on Thursday received an extension of vital lines of credit which it uses to buy oil and agreed with bondholders to develop a restructuring plan to revive the debt-stricken utility.

PREPA, with around $9 billion of debt, is widely viewed to be in the weakest condition of Puerto Rico's highway, water and electricity agencies. A restructuring of its debt, moving to cheaper fuel and cutting jobs are seen as vital to its longer-term health. Under the terms of Thursday's deal, PREPA must deliver a full debt restructuring plan by March 2, it said in a statement.
