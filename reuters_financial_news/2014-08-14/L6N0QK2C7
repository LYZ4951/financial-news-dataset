VIENNA, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The Austrian government has hired PwC Transaction Services to advise it on the sale of nationalised lender Kommunalkredit [KAFINK.UL].

It said in an official notice on Thursday that PwC [PWC.UL] would act as exclusive financial adviser for the deal. Austria is attempting to sell a scaled-down version of Kommunalkredit after failing last year to reprivatise the public-sector finance specialist which it nationalised in 2008. [ID:nL6N0QH3JI]
