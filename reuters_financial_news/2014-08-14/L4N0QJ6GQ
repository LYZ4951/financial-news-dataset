SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Aug 14(Reuters) - Australian shares added 0.6 percent on Thursday, underpinned by a firmer finish on Wall Street, better-than-expected earnings for Australia's largest telecommunications provider Telstra, and a return to profit for media group Fairfax.

Telstra Corporation Ltd <TLS.AX> climbed 1.9 percent to A$5.54, its highest since March 2002, after its full-year earnings came in above forecasts, with the company saying it would buy back A$1 billion in shares while also hiking its dividend.

The Australian benchmark hit a six-year high of 5,644.2 points on July 31 but fell to a trough of 5,425.2 on August 8 on geopolitical concerns in Ukraine and Gaza, though some better-than-expected  earnings have helped the market recover from those levels.  "We had a positive offshore lead, and then we've had some pretty solid results from Telstra, Fairfax and Crown, all of them have produced earnings ahead of expectations," said Matthew Sherwood, head of investments at Perpetual in Sydney.  Australian media group Fairfax Media Ltd <FXJ.AX> reported a return to profit on Thursday, posting annual net earnings of A$224.4 million after slashing costs, but warned of difficult trading conditions.

The resins and coatings manufacturer jumped 5.5 percent to hit a one-month high of NZ$3.10 (2.62 US dollars) after its full-year profits came in slightly stronger than analyst forecasts. [ID:nW9N0OK02B] Further NZX gains were tempered by an 8.4 percent slide in Guinness Peat Group <GPG.NZ> to a seven-month low of NZ$0.060.
