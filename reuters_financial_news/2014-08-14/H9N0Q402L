HONG KONG, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished lower on Thursday, with investors taking profits on Chinese energy firms and companies that posted strong earnings.

A decline in mainland China indexes also weighed on the market. The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended down 0.4 percent at 24,801.36 points, after hitting its highest intraday level since November 2010. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong, which closed at an 8-month high on Wednesday, sank 1.1 percent. Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> was the biggest index drag, shedding 2.3 percent. The largest-listed Chinese tech firm on Wednesday posted a profit gain of more than 50 percent in the second quarter as smartphone gaming revenue grew at a breakneck pace. [ID:nL4N0QJ3CE] Shares of Lenovo Group <0992.HK> were also pulled down from their more than 14-year high with a drop of 1.4 percent, after reporting results that beat estimates. [ID:nL4N0QK05B]
