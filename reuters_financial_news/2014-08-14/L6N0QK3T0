CAIRO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound was unchanged at a central bank dollar sale on Thursday from the rate in a sale a day earlier, and it was also stable on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $39.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds per dollar. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed in a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.40 pounds, one trader said, the same rate as Wednesday.
