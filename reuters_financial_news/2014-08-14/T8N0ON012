TAIPEI, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Nomura Bank International said on Thursday it has issued $325 million in 30-year zero coupon bonds in Taiwan - the first bond issue here by a Japanese insitution in years.

The bonds were issued at par and bear an internal rate of return of 4.95 percent a year, Nomura said in a statement, adding the securities have been offered to institutional investors in Taiwan and listed on the GreTai Securities Market. "This bond issuance is a first not just for Nomura, but also for a Japanese financial institution issuing an onshore bond in Taiwan in recent years," said Amy Tsao, president of Nomura in Taiwan.
