STOCKHOLM, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The growth rate for Swedish home prices reached double digits on an annual basis for the first time in more than four years in July, the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) showed on Thursday.

Home prices were up 10.5 percent from a year earlier and rose 0.5 percent in July from June. The last time prices rose more than 10 percent on an annual basis was in February 2010. The price for apartments rose 3.5 percent compared to the previous month and was up 14.1 percent compared to the same month last year. Single-family house prices fell by 1.1 percent on the month, but were up 8.5 percent on the year. The HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends. A boom in Swedish home prices since the late 1990s has driven up household debt to some of the highest levels in Europe, raising concerns among policy makers. The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) has introduced tougher rules for lenders and borrowers, but the government and the central bank has said more measures are needed to cool the housing market. On Monday, Finance Minister Anders Borg said amortisation requirements should be rolled out gradually. [ID:nS3N0LB00J]
