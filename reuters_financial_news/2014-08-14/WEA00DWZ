PARIS, Aug 14 (Reuters) - French private equity firm Ardian and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International <0656.HK> said on Thursday they would withdraw their offer for resort operator Club Mediterranee <CMIP.PA> after the French regulator gave the go-ahead for a rival bid.

Gaillon Invest, the investment vehicle of the Ardian-Fosun alliance, said in a statement it would ask the AMF stock market regulator to withdraw the offer.
