ISTANBUL, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Shares in Turkish Islamic lender Bank Asya <ASYAB.IS> will remain suspended until uncertainty regarding its ownership is resolved, the Istanbul stock exchange said on Thursday.

Last week, top government officials appeared to be at odds over a possible state purchase of the bank as Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said state-run Ziraat Bank, which is looking to launch its own Islamic banking unit, could buy Bank Asya, but an advisor to Erdogan subsequently denied such a plan.  The bank has seen its profits and capital base collapse since December when it found itself at the centre of a power struggle between Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and his political foe Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric whose sympathisers founded the bank.
