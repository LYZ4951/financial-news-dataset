June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has affirmed  Thailand-based SCB Asset Management Co., Ltd's (SCBAM) National Asset Manager  Rating at 'Highest Standards (tha)'. The Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of SCBAM's rating is driven by the company's established history  of fund management, its strong domestic market position and support from its  sole shareholder - Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited <SCB.BK> (SCB;  AA(tha)/Stable/F1+(tha)). SCBAM also benefits from its parent's distribution  capacity and extensive resources in risk management, compliance and IT.   The rating also takes into account SCBAM's experienced senior management and  investment staff, with staff turnover in equity investment management improving  in 2013. The rating is further supported by a solid control framework,  formalised investment process, and increased automation in front-office  functions after IT upgrades were completed in December 2013. Middle and back  office functions have also been upgraded in prior years. The main challenges facing SCBAM are expanding its market share and assets under  management (AUM) amid intensifying competition. There is also scope for  improving the performance of its equity funds, and for ensuring integration  across systems following recent front-office upgrades.   SCBAM's 'Highest Standards (tha)' rating is based on the following category  scores: Company: High Controls: Highest Investments: High Operations: Highest Technology: Highest  Asset manager operations in the 'Highest Standards' National Scale category  demonstrate an operational framework that Fitch considers superior relative to  domestic institutional standards.   Company SCBAM benefits from stable ownership by its sole shareholder, SCB, which has  expressed full commitment to the asset management business and demonstrated  operational and financial support for SCBAM. Although its products are  predominantly fixed-income and money-market funds, SCBAM has diversified to  local equity funds, mixed funds investing domestically and globally, multi-asset  class investment including global funds, as well as risk target funds. SCBAM has  also become more customer-centric in its products for institutional provident  and private fund clients.   Controls SCBAM's risk management and control framework is strong and governed by SCB,  using the latter's extensive staff, tools and expertise. Operational and  investment risks are managed through close coordination between SCBAM's risk  management committee and SCB's risk management division. Risk monitoring is  further bolstered by SCBAM's pre- and post-trade compliance. Its pre-trade  checks have improved following recent upgrades in its front-office system.  Investments SCBAM's investment process is formalised, marked by in-depth research,  disciplined buy-and-sell process, formal portfolio reviews and documentation of  investment decisions. Investment decisions are derived from its fundamental  analysis as well as quantitative approaches. Fixed income investment remains its  key strength, outperforming benchmarks in 2013. However, the credit analyst  workload appears heavy. The equity investment process has been impacted by the  departure of senior-level staff in prior years. Equity performance in 2013 has  been relatively weak amid efforts to refine its equity investment approach.   Operations SCBAM's reporting services to investors are in compliance with regulation and in  line with local practice. It has improved communication with provident fund  clients, including on-line accessibility. In 2014, SCBAM will be a registrar for  provident funds under its management, whereby information on subscription and  redemption will automatically be reflected in the company's portfolios, helping  to reduce the scope for input error. SCBAM has conducted detailed fund analysis  (including performance attribution and key risk indicators), but, to date, it  has been mainly for internal use.   Technology SCBAM benefits from SCB's extensive IT resources and a system upgrade of front,  middle, and back-office operations. This has allowed SCBAM to handle more  complex assets. For 2014, SCBAM is considering further improvements for its  risk-management tools, pending selection of key vendors.   Company Profile Incorporated in March 1992, SCBAM is the asset management arm of SCB. With AUM  of THB963bn (USD29.7bn) at end-May 2014, the company is the second-largest asset  management company in Thailand. SCBAM invests mainly in the Thai market and  covers all asset classes with approximately 80% of AUM in fixed income and money  market products.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
