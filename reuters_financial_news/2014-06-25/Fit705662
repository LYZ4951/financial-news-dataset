June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed SWIP Sterling Investment Cash Fund's Fund Credit and Volatility Ratings at 'AAA'/'V1'. The fund is a sub-fund of Ireland-domiciled SWIP Investment Cash OEIC plc managed by Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The main drivers for the fund's credit rating affirmation are: -- The high average credit quality of the fund's portfolio of assets -- The distribution of asset ratings and investment guidelines limiting the  minimum rating of assets and counterparties to 'A-'/'F1' (or equivalent) -- Portfolio diversification  The main drivers for the fund's volatility rating affirmation are: -- The fund's low exposure to interest rates with duration maintained below one  year -- Contained spread duration exposure   ASSET CREDIT QUALITY The credit quality of assets, combined with the high issuer diversification  within the portfolio, is consistent with Fitch's criteria for a 'AAA' Fund  Credit Rating. The fund invests in a diversified portfolio of assets, typically  comprising certificates of deposit, commercial papers, time deposits, fixed- and  floating-rate government and corporate bonds, including covered bonds, and  asset-backed securities (ABS). Underlying counterparties and securities must  carry a minimum rating of 'A-'/'F1' (or equivalent) at time of purchase. At end-May 2014, the fund was invested in 58 issuers, of which 42% were rated  'AAA' and the minimum credit quality of assets was 'A'. ABS investments are in  prime European - typically UK - RMBS and credit card ABS, which carry a minimum  rating of 'AAA'. The top five issuer exposures comprised 20% of the portfolio as of end-May 2014.  Under the fund's investment guidelines, concentration per issuer or counterparty  is limited to no more than 5% of the fund's net assets, unless the exposure is  to government debt or overnight deposits, which may account for up to 10%.  PORTFOLIO SENSITIVITY TO MARKET RISKS The fund's weighted-average maturity to reset (WAM) is maintained well below one  year. Maturity of investments is limited to three and five years for fixed-rate  and floating-rate instruments, respectively. At end-May, the fund had a WAM of  144 days and weighted average life (WAL) of 420 days with 52% of total assets  maturing within one year. The fund has no foreign exchange exposure. Liquidity and spread risk that may stem from ABS exposure is limited as the  fund's allocation to such assets may not account for more than 15% of the  portfolio's total assets (9.5% at end-May 2014).  THE ADVISOR SWIP, the fund's investment manager, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aberdeen  Asset Management Ltd (Aberdeen, A/Stable/F1) since 1 April 2014, when the Lloyds  Banking group <LLOY.L> sold its participation. SWIP operates as a subsidiary of Aberdeen  with its own governance until the integration of the SWIP and Aberdeen  businesses is defined and completed. Monitoring and control of sensitive  activities have adequately been strengthened since January 2013. At end-March  2014, the combined SWIP and Aberdeen group was managing GBP324.5bn of assets  globally, including 30% in money market and fixed-income assets.   FUND PROFILE SWIP Sterling Investment Cash Fund is a sub-fund of Ireland-domiciled SWIP  Investment Cash OEIC plc, an umbrella-type open-ended investment company  pursuant to the UCITS regulation. As of end-May 2014, the fund's total assets  stood at GBP3.3bn.  RATING SENSITIVITY  The ratings may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or market  risk profiles of the fund. A material adverse deviation from Fitch's guidelines  for any key rating driver could cause the ratings to be downgraded.
