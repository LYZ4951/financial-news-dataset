OSLO, June 25 (Reuters) - The sale of new homes picked up in key regions of Norway during the last two months but still trails last year's levels, think tank Samfunnsoekonomisk Analyse (SA) said on Wednesday.

House prices have rebounded this year after a sharp drop in late 2013 that hit the demand for new dwellings particularly hard. In the populous south-east region, including Oslo, new home sales rose by 53 percent from mid-April to mid-June compared to the previous two-month period, but were still down 10 percent compared to the year-ago period. "The increase is bigger than normal for this time of the year," SA said in a statement. Nationwide, some 2,155 new homes were sold over the two month period, 520 more than in the previous two months. Year-on-year numbers were unavailable. "It is positive to see a rebound in the new homes market and it indicates that the fall will not be as deep as feared. There will still be a great demand for houses going forward, and with less houses beeing built, prices will rise," Chief Economist Roger Bjoernstad said.
