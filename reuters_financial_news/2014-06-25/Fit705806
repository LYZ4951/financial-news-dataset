June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published the latest edition of the  'Russian Banks Datawatch', a monthly publication of spreadsheets with key data  from Russian banks' statutory accounts. The latest issue includes balance sheet  figures as of 1 June 2014, as well as changes in May 2014. In addition, charts  indicate changes in the last month for Russia's main state-related,  privately-owned, foreign-owned and retail banks.   Fitch notes the following key developments in May 2014:  - Corporate lending growth moderated to 0.4% after a strong 1.8% average for  4M14. Of the bigger banks Credit Bank of Moscow, Raiffeisen and Unicredit grew  stronger by over 2.5%, while some of the bigger contractions were reported by  MDM (-5.5%) and Rosbank (-3.3%)   - Retail lending growth was 1.2% in May (5.9% in 5M14), although still  significantly below the 3% monthly average for last year. Of the May growth some  86% was accounted for by state banks. Among specialised retail banks Tinkoff and  OTP grew in line with market, while Rencredit, Home Credit and Russian Standard  were roughly flat. Sovcombank's rapid 38% growth was mainly due to the transfer  of retail loans from the recently purchased GE Money Bank - Overdue loans increased by RUB119bn for the sector, of which VTB contributed  RUB60bn (an amount equal to 10% of regulatory capital), related to  RUB-denominated exposures to non-residents - Customer funding (excluding funds of state-related entities, which we consider  as part of government funding) increased by RUB107bn in May, which was a  combination of a RUB195bn inflow of corporate accounts and a RUB88bn outflow of  retail deposits. Most inflows of corporate funding were in private banks  (Alfa-Bank - an increase of RUB33bn or 7%; Rosbank - RUB21bn, 10%; UniCredit -  RUB25bn, 7%, Promsvyaz - RUB28bn, 8%). Of state-related banks Gazprombank  increased corporate accounts by RUB46bn or 2%, while others jointly reported a  RUB75bn outflow.  Retail deposits leaked across the whole sector with the  biggest outflows reported by Sberbank (RUB69bn of outflows), in part reflecting  its market share - The net increase of customer funding was  sufficient to fund only 40% of May's  moderate RUB279bn lending growth, with the remainder being covered by funds  attracted from state authorities, namely from MinFin (up RUB125bn at RUB643bn)  and regional and federal budgets (up RUB76bn at RUB640bn), while Central Bank of  Russia (CBR) funding was almost unchanged at RUB5trn. As a result, total  government funding reached RUB6.5trn or 12.7% of total system liabilities at  end-5M14. The CBR expects its funding of the sector to grow to RUB7trn by  end-2014, although this could partly be used to refinance some seasonal outflows  of MinFin deposits  - Banks earned net income of RUB93bn in May (17% annualised ROAE), although  profits were mainly concentrated in Sberbank (RUB26bn), VTB Group (RUB20bn, of  which RUB11bn earned by Bank of Moscow could relate to some one-off recoveries),  Gazprombank <GZPRI.RTS> (RUB8bn) and Alfa (RUB7bn), while 20 banks from the sample reported  losses. Most specialised retail banks demonstrated poor performance and were  loss-making or just moderately profitable. Home Credit's RUB1.3bn net income in  May was solely due to deferred tax recognition, without which it would have been  slightly below breakeven - Capitalisaiton remains moderate. As of 1 June, 14 banks from the sample had a  total capital ratio (N1, 10% minimum) below 11%, including five below 10.5%.  These were Promsvyaz (10.4%, moderately improved from 10.1% last month),  Rencredit (10.2%, dropped again due to losses), Probusinessbank (10.4%, stable),  Tatfondbank (10.3%) and Moscow Industrial Bank (10.3%) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Russian Banks Datawatch 5M14 - Excel file
