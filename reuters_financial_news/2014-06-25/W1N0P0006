WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday criticized congressional Republicans for considering a lawsuit against President Barack Obama for his use of executive actions this year to move his agenda forward.

U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said he planned to file a lawsuit alleging that Obama has abused his executive authority by implementing policies without congressional approval.
