TIRANA, June 25 (Reuters) - Albania's central bank held its benchmark rate at a record low of 2.5 percent on Wednesday, saying that level would help inflation return to its 3 percent target.

"The Board thinks the gradual transmission of the previous cuts of the basic interest rate in the financial markets will create the suitable monetary conditions to secure a return of inflation to its target in the medium-term," the bank said.
