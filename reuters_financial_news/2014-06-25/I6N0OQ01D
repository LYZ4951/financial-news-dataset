MILAN, June 25 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> opened more than 20 percent lower on Wednesday as the Italian lender is nearing the end of its 5 billion euro ($6.8 billion) rights issue.

A market source said from Wednesday it was possible to arbitrage between the shares and the rights without having to borrow the shares. Shareholders who have exercised their rights can now subscribe to the new shares at 1 euro each and sell a corresponding number of shares on the market.   By 0802 GMT, Monte Paschi shares were trading at 1.485 euros, down 20.5 percent, having initially failed to open.
