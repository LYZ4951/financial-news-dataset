June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd.'s <0688.HK> (COLI; BBB+/Stable)  USD250m retap of its 4.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019, USD250m retap of its 5.95% senior unsecured notes due 2024 and issuance of USD500m 6.45% senior unsecured notes due 2034 final ratings of 'BBB+'. The notes, which are issued by China Overseas Finance (Cayman) VI  Limited, are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by COLI. The notes are rated at the same level as COLI's senior unsecured debt rating as  they represent direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations  of the company. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected  rating assigned on 3 June 2014.  KEY RATINGS DRIVERS Leading Homebuilder: COLI has been one of the top homebuilders in China since it  started operations in 1984. It has consistently generated high profit margins -  EBITDA margin of 30% in 2013 - that reflect its premium prices and effective  cost management. Its strong brand is supported by its nationwide presence and  focus on first-time homebuyers and "upgraders" who seek better homes than their  existing residences. COLI ranked among the top three largest home sellers in 10  major cities in 2013.  Slower Contracted Sales Growth: COLI expects contracted sales in 2014 of  HKD140bn, unchanged from 2013, when its contracted sales rose 66%. This is due  to the strong growth in the whole property market in 2013, resulting in a higher  base of comparison. COLI's background as a construction company gives it  valuable insight into construction costs, leading to higher-quality products and  stronger pricing power. COLI will continue to use its brand reputation, and  focus on first-time homebuyers and upgraders who demand better quality at  affordable prices. We expect this strategy to help COLI to meet its 20% net  profit growth target in 2014. Well-Established Track Record: COLI has established itself as a nationwide  homebuilder with operations around the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta,  Bohai Rim, and the northern and western regions. It has displayed resilience  through several industry downturns during its 29-year operating history, with  high profitability relative to its peers and broad funding diversity.  Diversified Funding Enhances Liquidity: COLI also has one of the lowest  borrowing costs among homebuilders. Its weighted average borrowing cost was at  3.7% in 2013. Its low funding costs are the result of access to the offshore  bond and loan markets, and its state-owned enterprise (SOE) status, which aids  access to domestic funding. COLI continues to maintain a strong liquidity  position and had HKD9.6bn in undrawn committed bank facilities and cash balance  of HKD25.3bn at end-March 2013.  Outlook Stable: Fitch expects that COLI will maintain its leadership position in  the Chinese residential homebuilding market, with a clear focus on first-time  homebuyers and upgraders; leverage its operational and financial flexibility;  and continue to grow at a moderate pace in the highly competitive and cyclical  Chinese property market.  RATING SENSITIVITIES: Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Unfavourable changes to China's regulation or economy leading to a decline in  contracted sales; or  - Decline in EBITDA margin to below 25%; or  -Deterioration in net debt/adjusted inventory to above 30% over a sustained  period (2013: 23%); or - Significant change from its current focus on first-time homebuyers and  upgraders.
