SAO PAULO, June 25 (Reuters) - Brazil's Monetary Policy Council, the nation's main economic policymaking body, decided on Wednesday to set the mid-point target for annual consumer price increases at 4.5 percent for 2016, with a leeway of plus or minus two percentage points.

The body, known in Brazil as CMN, is formed by the finance minister, the planning and budget minister and the president of the central bank. The inflation targets for 2014 and 2015 remained at 4.5 percent with a similar leeway.
