FRANKFURT, June 25 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> on Wednesday said it had successfully completed an 8.5 billion euro ($11.6 billion) capital increase aimed at fortifying its regulatory ratios and paying for a restructuring.

"We have taken decisive steps to protect Deutsche Bank against known capital challenges, sharpen our competitive edge, and accelerate investments in growth in all our business divisions," Deutsche Bank Co-Chief Executives Juergen Fitschen and Anshu Jain said in a statement. The lion's share of the capital increase came from a public offering with subscription rights at 22.50 per share, of which 99.1 percent were exercised, Deutsche Bank said.
