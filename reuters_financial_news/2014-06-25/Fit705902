June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Coventry Building Society's <CVB_p.L> (A/Stable/F1/a) GBP400m resetting perpetual contingent convertible additional Tier 1 capital securities a 'BB+' final rating. The rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 17 June 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments with fully discretionary  interest payments and are subject to conversion into core capital deferred  shares (CCDS) on breach of a 7% CRD IV common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio.  Although Coventry does not yet have any CCDS in issuance, it has received  members' approval to issue these at any time.  The securities are notched five levels below Coventry's 'a' Viability Rating  (VR), in accordance with Fitch's criteria for "Assessing and Rating Bank  Subordinated and Hybrid Securities". The notes are notched twice for loss  severity to reflect the conversion into CCDS on breach of the trigger, and three  times for non-performance risk. The notching for non-performance risk reflects the instruments' fully  discretionary interest payment, which Fitch considers the most easily activated  form of loss absorption. The issuer will not make an interest payment if it has  insufficient distributable items or if it is insolvent. The issuer will also be  subject to restrictions on interest payments if it fails to meet the combined  buffer capital requirements that will be gradually phased in from 2016. Fitch has assigned 100% equity credit to the securities. This reflects their  full coupon flexibility, the ability to be converted into CCDS before the  society becomes non-viable, their permanent nature and their subordination to  all senior creditors.
