June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Banks and other market participants are increasingly looking to securitise residential mortgage and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loan portfolios materially exposed to refinanced or restructured assets in Europe, Fitch Ratings says. The variety of loan  restructurings means that if we were to rate such securitisation transactions  our credit analysis of these assets would have to be supported by detailed data  on their causes, terms, and outcome. We would also assess the servicer's  expertise in managing restructured assets.  The enquiries we have received on potential deals mainly concern collateral in  countries which have experienced sharp economic and/or housing market  corrections since the credit crisis.  Restructured or refinanced loan portfolios  in Spain, for example, are estimated at EUR211.3bn at end-2013, equivalent to  15.3% of total lending to the private sector, of which around two-thirds are to  SME or corporate borrowers and a third to individuals, mostly via residential  mortgages.  We think the number of debt restructuring agreements in such countries will rise  over the coming months, reflecting deleveraging by the banking sector and recent  legislative initiatives. Spain's insolvency law has been modified, making  pre-insolvency debt restructuring agreements easier. Legal and regulatory  changes in Ireland have created incentives for mortgage lenders and borrowers to  agree long-term alternative repayment arrangements.  We are closely monitoring market developments on restructured or refinanced  loans that could be subject to a securitisation transaction or added to mortgage  cover pools.  We expect lenders to use a wider range of restructuring techniques  in future, reflecting economic stabilisation and legal changes. These may  include maturity extensions, principal balance forgiveness, payment in kind, and  debt-to-equity transactions.  Seventy per cent of the restructured or refinanced exposure in Spain is  classified as either substandard or doubtful by lenders. This supports our view  that these assets are typically linked to weaker borrowers with potentially  adverse credit history. Nevertheless, restructured loans are expected to have  established a track record of payment under the restructured obligations. This  is because any lender who has formalised a restructuring plan to a troubled  borrower should have concluded that the changes would restore its financial or  business viability.  The credit analysis of any of these portfolios within the context of a  securitisation transaction would therefore have to be supported with a detailed,  loan-by-loan dataset that describes the nature of restructuring terms, borrower  circumstances before and after each restructuring, and the payment track record  since origination date. We would also take into account redefault rates  experienced by the lender following similar restructurings.
