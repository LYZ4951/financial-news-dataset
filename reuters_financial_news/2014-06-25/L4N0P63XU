June 25 (Reuters) - Penn Virginia Corp's <PVA.N> biggest shareholder George Soros reiterated that the oil and gas producer should sell itself and said he would take action if the company failed to do so.

Soros, who took a 9.18 percent stake in the company in March, had said the company should explore strategic options and that he would continue to have talks with the board, shareholders and potential suitors.
