WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday said lawmakers need to examine the U.S. Export-Import Bank amid accusations of kickbacks and improper gifts as the agency comes up for reauthorization.

Boehner declined to say whether he supports reauthorizing the bank and said his job is to facilitate debate among  Republicans on the issue.
