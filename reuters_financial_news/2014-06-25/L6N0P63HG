ABU DHABI, June 25 (Reuters) - Dubai's flagship airline Emirates [EMIRA.UL] has suspended flights to and from Peshawar effective from Wednesday because of the security situation in the Pakistani city, the carrier said.

Flights are suspended until further notice and passengers will be rebooked on alternative Emirates flights, it said.
