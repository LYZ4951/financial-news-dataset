UNITED NATIONS, June 25 (Reuters) - Argentina's economy minister Axel Kicillof said on Wednesday he did not and would not meet with holdout creditors seeking payment on bonds Argentina defaulted on in 2001-2002 during his current trip to New York.

"I held a meeting with our lawyers," Kicillof said during a press conference that followed a presentation to members of the Group of 77 plus China meeting at the U.N. in New York. [ID:nL2N0P60MH] "We have not met with representatives of the (U.S.) court or with those that filed this claim," he said, referring to the holdouts.
