HALLE, Germany, June 25 (Reuters) - The president of Germany's Bundesbank has voiced scepticism about the European Central Bank supporting the market for securitisation, and played down the threat of falling prices in the euro zone, saying it posed only a slight risk.

"The revival of the securitisation market is not a primary task of monetary policy," European Central Bank policymaker Jens Weidmann told an audience in Halle in eastern Germany. "The euro system must not become the bad bank of Europe by taking risks off banks and passing them onto the taxpayer." The ECB is preparing for possible future purchases of asset-backed securities to support small business.
