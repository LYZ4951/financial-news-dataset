June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Malaysia-based MNRB Retakaful Berhad's (MRT) Insurer Financial Strength rating at 'BBB+' with Stable Outlook.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating takes into consideration the operational support given by the MNRB  Group, given MRT's importance to the group's strategy of developing its  retakaful business in the region. The rating also incorporates MRT's sound  capital level commensurate with its business profile, gradual turnaround in its  financial performance and its conservative investment mix.  On the other hand, MRT has the challenging task of establishing a stronger  foothold and market presence in the Malaysian market, amid a competitive and  evolving takaful operating environment. The company also faces the challenge of  controlling its expenses effectively as it builds up its business portfolio. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that potential execution risks  associated with MRT's business plan are mitigated by MNRB Group's commitment to  support its operations.  Based on the unaudited information for the financial year ended 31 March 2014  (FY14), about 55% of MRT's business portfolio is made up of general retakaful  business and 45% family retakaful business, sourced largely within Malaysia. To  maximise operational efficiency, the company adopts the same branding as the  group and draws on shared resources within the group to support its non-core  functions, including information technology, finance, human resources and  administration.   On a standalone basis, MRT registered a smaller net loss of MYR0.8m compared  with -MYR12.9m in FY13. The improvement was mainly due to the adoption of more  prudent underwriting practice during the year. The combined ratio for the  general retakaful fund was estimated to improve to below 100% from about 120%  for FY13.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers for an upgrade of MRT's rating include an increase in its  strategic importance to MNRB Group. Any upgrade based on its standalone credit  profile is unlikely in the near to medium term, although it is possible in the  longer term if there is sustained significant improvement in its standalone  fundamentals. The latter are assessed in terms of market franchise, business  growth, capital levels relative to its business profile and sound operating  performance with sustained profitability and an overall combined ratio falling  below 110% for a prolonged period.  Key rating triggers for a downgrade include weakening in its strategic  importance to MNRB Group, or deterioration in MRT's standalone credit profile,  such as poor operating performance with net losses in the takaful funds for an  extended period, and weaker-than-expected business growth/franchise performance.
