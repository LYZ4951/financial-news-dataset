LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - British finance minister George Osborne said he hoped the country's launch of its first sovereign Islamic bond, known as a sukuk, would spur greater corporate issuance of the debt.

Britain sold 200 million pounds ($339.43 million) of the sukuk, which matures in 2019, and attracted orders totalling 2.3 billion pounds, the finance ministry said. "We have seen very strong demand for the Sukuk, resulting in a price that delivers good value for money for the taxpayer. I hope that the success of this government issuance will encourage further private sector issuances of Sukuk in the UK," Osborne said.
