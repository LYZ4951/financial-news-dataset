June 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Sberbank of Russia's EUR1bn Eurobond issue a 'BBB' Long-term rating. The notes were issued by Luxembourg-based SPV SB Capital S.A. [SBCAP.UL] under Sberbank's USD30bn loan participation notes programme, which Fitch rates at Long-term 'BBB' and Short-term 'F3'. The notes are due in November 2019 and have a fixed 3.3524% coupon paid  annually. Sberbank's obligations under the notes will rank equally with the  claims of other senior unsecured creditors, except the claims of retail  depositors. Under Russian law, the claims of retail depositors rank above those  of other senior unsecured creditors. At end-5M14, retail deposits accounted for  51.1% of Sberbank's total liabilities, according to the bank's unconsolidated  financial statements under local accounting standards.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The issue's rating corresponds to Sberbank's Long-term foreign currency Issuer  Default Rating (IDR, 'BBB'/Negative). Sberbank's IDRs are underpinned by Fitch's  view of a very high probability of support from the Russian authorities, in case  of need and by the bank's standalone strength, reflected in its 'bbb' Viability  Rating (VR). The Negative Outlook on Sberbank's ratings is driven by the  Negative Outlook on Russia's sovereign IDRs (see ' Fitch Revises Russia's  Outlook to Negative; Affirms at 'BBB' ', dated 21 March 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com).
