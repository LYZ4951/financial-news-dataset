MUMBAI, June 25 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Wednesday for a fifth session in six with blue-chips such as Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> taking a hit as caution ahead of expiry of June derivatives on Thursday and fears of more violence in Iraq prompted investors to pare positions.

Reliance Industries provisionally fell 1.1 percent, while HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> ended lower 0.5 percent.
