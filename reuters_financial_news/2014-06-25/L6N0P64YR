ISTANBUL, June 25 (Reuters) - Turkey's lira and stocks reversed its losses on Wednesday after a big downward revision to U.S. economic data raised analysts' expectations of continued loose monetary policy and cash inflows into emerging markets.

U.S. gross domestic product fell at a 2.9 percent annual rate, instead of the 1.0 percent reported last month, showing that the U.S. economy had contracted at a much steeper pace than previously estimated. The Turkish lira <TRYTOM=D3> was at 2.1327 by 1523 GMT versus 2.1401 earlier on Wednesday. The main Istanbul share index <.XU100> reversed its earlier losses to close flat at 78,997.88 points. The U.S. data revision could prompt the Federal Reserve to postpone its expected interest rate hikes, which would be a positive for emerging markets like Turkey, Serdar Pazi from Finansinvest said. "We have seen a rise in emerging markets following the revision," Pazi said.
