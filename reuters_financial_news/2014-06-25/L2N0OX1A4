June 25 (Reuters) - Argentina's Economy Minister Axel Kicillof is due to address the United Nations on Wednesday about the country's standoff with holdout bond investors, but it remains to be seen whether he will actually open negotiations while the clock ticks down toward a debt default.

Argentine President Cristina Fernandez said last week her government would negotiate with all the country's creditors in a bid to avoid default, comments that sparked a market rally on hopes that the country's long debt-related court battles may soon end.The following are key recent stories on the situation:LATEST NEWS > Argentina's Kicillof to address UN, unclear if to meet holdouts[ID:nL2N0P60MH] > UNCTAD: Ruling on Argentina debt doesn't comply with U.S. law  [ID:nL6N0P64UU] > Argentina debt holdouts: Would discuss extension in good faith [ID:nL2N0P51WC] > Argentina courts Europeans over debt saga with newspaper ads   [ID:nL6N0P51XV] > Argentina seeks U.S. court stay to avoid new debt crisis   [ID:L2N0P40KE] > Argentina's Fernandez willing to talk with all creditors   [ID:nL2N0P11AM] > Argentina: no preparations for "possible" trip to U.S. [ID:nL2N0P00CW] > S&P lowers Argentina's rating to CCC-  [ID:nL4N0OY3WA] > Argentina says next bond payment 'impossible,' default looms   [ID:nL2N0OZ0NE] > Argentina flirts with debt swap as fear of default rises   [ID:nL2N0OY1ZM] > Argentina vows to service debt despite new legal blow  [ID:nL2N0OX221] > U.S. high court rejects Argentina appeal   [ID:nL2N0OX0KJ] > Argentina gets wink, nudge from U.S. Supreme Court [ID:nL2N0OX0NX] > INSTANT VIEW-Argentina eyes new debt swap  [ID:nL2N0OY22F]COLUMNS/BREAKINGVIEWS > Target for fixing Argentine bond mess looks small  [ID:nL2N0P414I] > Now Argentina wants to negotiate.
