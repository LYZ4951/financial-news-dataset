MUMBAI, June 25 (Reuters) - Shares in Astrazeneca Pharma India Ltd <ASTR.NS> fell 3 percent after India's market regulator on Tuesday said stock exchanges will closely monitor the company's delisting process and promptly report any aberrations.

"The promoters of M/s Astrazeneca Pharma India Ltd. shall finally purchase shares from public shareholders in the delisting offer only after seeking approval of the Bombay Stock Exchange Limited and National Stock Exchange Limited," added the Securities and Exchange Board of India in an order. The regulator also said it came across certain reports that the offer for sale (OFS) of the shares of Astrazeneca Pharma India Ltd carried out by its promoter AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals AB Sweden on May 26, 2013 was a deliberate attempt to subsequently get the shares of the Indian unit delisted at ease.
