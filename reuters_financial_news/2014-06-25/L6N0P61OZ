LISBON, June 25 (Reuters) - Shares in Millennium bcp, Portugal's second largest listed bank, reversed course in volatile trade on Wednesday and surged mores than 9 percent after announcing a capital hike.

Shares in the bank opened sharply lower but then reversed and rose as much as 9.6 percent. At 0840 they traded 5.36 percent higher at 0.1670 euros a share. Traders said the gains in the shares came on the view that the capital hike was set at an atractive price and that the shares had fallen a lot in anticipation of the announcement.  "I think there was a very exageratted correction of BCP shares on the expectation of this capital hike and now that it has been confirmed investors think the conditions of the operation are atractive and it will succeed," said Jose Novo, a trader at brokerage Orey iTrade. Investors also liked that the bank will use the capital increase to pay back expensive state loans, traders said.
