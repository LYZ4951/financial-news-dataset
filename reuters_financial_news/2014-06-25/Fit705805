RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating  action include: - An upgrade of Tesco's rating. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:  - A downgrade of Tesco's rating.
