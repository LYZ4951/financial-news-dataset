JERUSALEM, June 25 (Reuters) - The Israeli shekel eased on Wednesday after the finance ministry said it was hedging against currency fluctuations, spurring market speculation the central bank could intervene to curb the shekel.

Israel's currency <ILS=> was trading at 3.442 per dollar by early afternoon, compared with a fixing of 3.433 on Tuesday, which was its strongest level since Aug. 1, 2011. "If the Bank of Israel doesn't intervene it (dollar-shekel) could reach 3.40," said Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading at Bank Leumi. "The Bank of Israel hasn't intervened but people are worried they might."   The shekel has gained 10 percent against the dollar since early 2013, hurting Israel's exports. The central bank's decision on Monday to leave interest rates on hold, rather than cut them as a few in the market expected, has further supported the shekel. After the currency appreciated by 0.6 percent on Tuesday, the Finance Ministry said it had made two dollar-hedging transactions on its foreign debt worth $150 million to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. "Market conditions, including the dollar-shekel exchange rate, support hedging transactions," the ministry said in a statement released on Wednesday. The Finance Ministry has made a number of similar hedging deals in recent months. Finance Minister Yair Lapid has said he wants to see a weaker shekel. Dealers said the ministry's actions triggered some dollar buying by importers, who believe the Bank of Israel could intervene as well. The central bank is independent from government. Exporters have called for action to stem the shekel's strength, including setting a floor of 3.80 shekels to the dollar. The Bank of Israel has so far rebuffed the calls for a floor, believing the exchange rate is stable after a steep appreciation in the first half of 2013.  Over the first five months of this year, it bought nearly $4 billion of foreign currency, although $1.5 billion of that was part of a programme intended to offset the effects of natural gas production that started in 2013 on the exchange rate.
