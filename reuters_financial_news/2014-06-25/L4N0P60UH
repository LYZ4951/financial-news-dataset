SEOUL, June 25 (Reuters) - South Korean shares slipped on Wednesday as a deepening crisis in Iraq prompted some investors to book profits, while the won <KRW=> eased on stock outflows and importers' demand for dollars.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.6 percent at 1,981.77 points, giving up more than half of Tuesday's 1 percent rise. Offshore investors positioned as net sellers by offloading 35 billion won ($34.39 million) worth of KOSPI shares, dragging Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> 1.9 percent lower.
