SOFIA, June 25 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's stock exchange on Wednesday said it would extend a freeze on share trading in Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, until the central bank relinquishes control of the country's fourth-largest lender.

A run on Corpbank last week prompted the central bank to take control of the lender for a period of three months, stop its operations and block depositors from withdrawing money.  The bourse had suspended trading in Corpbank on Friday and then extended that ban until Wednesday.
