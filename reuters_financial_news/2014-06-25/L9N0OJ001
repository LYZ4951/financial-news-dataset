LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - The UK Debt Management Office said it sold Britain's first Islamic bond on Wednesday at a profit rate of 2.036 percent, the same as the yield on the benchmark conventional five-year gilt <GB5YT=RR>.

The price of the 200 million pounds ($339.43 million) of five-year Islamic debt issued, known as a sukuk, was set at 100.00 pounds.
