SYDNEY, April 10 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose to a near six-year high on Thursday as a rally on Wall Street and an upbeat local jobs report buoyed investor optimism.

Australian employment rose by a solid 18,100 in March to handily beat expectations for a second month, while the jobless rate took a surprise dive to 5.8 percent. [ID:nL3N0N10IW] The Big Four banks underpinned the market for a second session.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> were up 0.4 percent or 22.2 points to 5,486.0 at 0206 GMT after touching an intraday high of 5,500.0, its highest point since June 2008. The benchmark jumped 1 percent on Wednesday, having recovered from a low of 5,288.5 touched on March 20, as China took modest steps to stimulate its economy and investors piled into cheaper stocks. "Comments within the Fed minutes on easing interest rate concerns has increased investor confidence and allowed yesterday's growth in the market to continue," Chay Flack, equities dealer at CMC Markets Stockbroking, said in a note to clients. U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting suggested that officials were not as eager to tighten policy as some investors believed.

Electronics and entertainment retailer JB Hi-Fi Ltd <JBH.AX> jumped 2 percent.

[ID:nL3N0N14WU] Transurban Group <TCL.AX> gained 1.3 percent to A$7.37, its highest point since 2007, after reporting its toll revenue had  increased by 12.9 percent to A$221.7 million for the March quarter.
