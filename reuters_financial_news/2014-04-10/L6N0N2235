ATHENS, April 10 (Reuters) - The French competition authority rather than the European Union's watchdog will examine French cable company Numericable's <NUME.PA> proposed acquisition of Vivendi's <VIV.PA> telecoms arm SFR, the EU antitrust chief said on Thursday.

Numericable, backed by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, won the battle for SFR last week in a deal that could create the second-biggest player in a reshaped French telecoms market. [ID:nL5N0MX0DL] The French government had backed rival bidder Bouygues <BOUY.PA>, France's No. 3 mobile operator. Numericable is 40 percent owned by Drahi's Luxembourg-based holding company Altice.  Observers have said the European Commission, which is examining Telefonica's <TEF.MC> E-Plus deal in Germany and Hutchison Whampoa's <0013.HK> 02 Ireland takeover bid in Ireland, may seek to take on the French case as well to establish a coordinated approach towards telecoms mergers. But European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the French agency would handle the Numericable deal.
