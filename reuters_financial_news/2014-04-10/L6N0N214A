COPENHAGEN, April 10 (Reuters) - Tryg <TRYG.CO>, the Nordic region's second-biggest general insurer, reported first-quarter pretax profit below expectations on Thursday, but maintained its financial targets.

First-quarter pretax profit fell to 602 million crowns ($111.47 million) from 759 million crowns in the same period a year earlier, below forecasts for 665 million in a Reuters poll of analysts.[ID:nL5N0MW38L].  The following are analyst comments:  JACOB PEDERSEN, SYDBANK  "The report is weaker than I had expected, and they still have a lot of work to do improving their top line." "Tryg has performed well the last quarters, but this is below expectations which could indicate the shares will be under pressure today."
