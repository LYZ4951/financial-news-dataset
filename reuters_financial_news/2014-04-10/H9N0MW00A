SHANGHAI, April 10 (Reuters) - China shares hit their highest level in nearly two months after Beijing's securities regulator said it would allow cross-border stock investment between Hong Kong and Shanghai.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 1.4 percent at 2,134.3 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 1.6 percent. Both indexes closed at their highest since Feb. 20. Shares in securities firms surged on the announcement, with the CSI300 financial sub-index <.CSI300FS> climbing to heights not seen since late last year. Ping An Insurance Group of China <601318.SS> jumped 7.1 percent, while CITIC Securities Co Ltd <600030.SS> increased 9.7 percent, their biggest one-day percentage gains since Nov. 18, with CITIC shares their most traded since Oct. 2010. Sinolink Securities Co Ltd <600109.SS> gained 5.2 percent.  But property shares fell as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a report that property debt may cause systemic financial risks, sparking worries over the funding situation in China's real estate market.
