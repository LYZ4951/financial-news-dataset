VIENNA, April 10 (Reuters) - Vienna Insurance Group's <VIGR.VI> embedded value rose 11 percent after taxes to 6.2 billion euros ($8.57 billion) at the end of 2013, it said on Thursday while releasing final 2013 results in line with its preliminary figures.

Emerging Europe's biggest insurer had said in January its 2013 pretax profit dropped 40 percent to about 350 million euros due to one-off effects in Italy and Romania. [ID:nL5N0L24FI]
