April 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says further weakening in loan documentation at the start of 2014 highlights the attempt by loan market investors to lure more leveraged loan issuance by European borrowers. Despite continued recovery in CLO 2.0 new issue and bank investor appetite, individual  loan new issuance trends are below 2013 levels.  Weaker documentation in Europe lags that of US, as Fitch has recorded only 15  transactions with covenant-lite (one maintenance covenant, typically on net  leverage) structures and 11 with covenant-loose (two sets of maintenance  covenants, typically net leverage and interest coverage) since 2011.  Nonetheless, recent new issuance such as the European "cov-lite" for France's  Ceva Sante highlights how lighter covenants have accompanied rising leverage  towards pre-crisis medians.  Competition from IPO markets and strategic corporates has limited large  leveraged buyouts as financial sponsors see valuation constraints. Consequently,  the agency is observing smaller deal size in comparison to pre-crisis averages.   The presence of covenants in pre-crisis structures did not necessarily signal  default nor improve recoveries among defaulted credits in the Fitch credit  opinion portfolio. Specifically, on defaults observed since 2007, considerable  covenant headroom on pre-crisis transactions meant 43% were linked to  unsustainable capital structures rather than covenant triggers. In addition,  senior leverage multiples at the time of default influenced recoveries more than  the presence of covenants.  Nonetheless, the agency notes the role covenants can play in the influence  senior lenders may exercise over an LBO, especially over re-pricing and amend  and extend negotiations, which rebuild par for CLOs and support stronger  recoveries over time. As covenants become looser and deal sizes decline, lenders  may have less ability to manage recovery, relying instead on secondary market  exits, which may prove difficult for the recent the smaller transactions (less  than EUR500m). The proportion of dividend recapitalisations has declined so far in 2014  compared with 2013. Sponsors are exiting via strategic sales or IPOs instead of  pursuing returns via dividend recaps. The resurgence of the IPO market also  reduces the amount of PIK toggle note issuance as these are instruments often  used in the context of recapitalisation. Strong equity and M&A markets translate  into increasing median enterprise value (EV) multiples, up to 10.4x for the  eight new transactions as of year-to-date March 2014 compared to 8.9x observed  through 2013. Credit quality within Fitch's European portfolio of credit opinions remained  broadly stable over the quarter ending February 2014, with a slight increase in  'B-*' issuers as some legacy issuers re-lever. The stability in the quality of  the portfolio is down to improvement in credit profiles through debt repayments,  IPOs and exits as well as organic deleveraging. Legacy 2005 to 2007 transactions  represented only 22% of Fitch's portfolio as of February. However, there is  continued distress in sectors such as continental retail and building materials,  notably in France where subordinated debt has finally forced debtors to seek  restructurings. Subordinated debt is present in 68% of 2005 to 2007 remaining  deals. For these issuers, prospects are either to restructure or seek a take-out  via sale, an equity event or high yield. Fitch's quarterly European leveraged loan chart book includes new data on loan  performance as well as recent trends in issuance, maturities and default rates.  The data and analysis is based on Fitch's portfolio of private credit opinions,  private rating and public ratings on about 375 European leveraged credits, (as  of February 2014) primarily LBOs, representing EUR284bn of senior and junior  loan debt.
