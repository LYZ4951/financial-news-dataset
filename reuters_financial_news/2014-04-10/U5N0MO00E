Jan 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street bond dealers last month began expecting an earlier first rate hike from the Federal Reserve, according to the results of a poll by the New York Fed released on Thursday, despite the Fed's  attempts to reassure markets it intended no change in policy.

Several dealers also thought rate hikes, once they started, would be slightly more aggressive, according to the poll, which asked dealers about their rate hike expectations both before and after the Fed's March 18-19 meeting.  Dealers who changed their expectations said they did so because of fresh forecasts from Fed officials showing a slightly steeper path of rate hikes, and "several pointed to comments made by (Fed) Chair (Janet Yellen) during her press conference."
