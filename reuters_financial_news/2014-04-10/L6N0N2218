STOCKHOLM, April 10 (Reuters) - The Swedish financial watchdog has grown less nervous about banks calculations of households ability to repay their mortgages, an FSA analyst said on Thursday.

The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) as well as the central bank have previously criticised the banks and how they assess household living costs. "We have gotten reasonable explanations for some of the deviations we saw last year, so in that sense we are somewhat more positive this year than we were last year," FSA analyst Hanna Karlsson told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference to present a new annual mortgage survey. There are still reasons to look at some of the banks' calculations however, Karlsson said.  "We do see differences, and we want to follow that up with the banks," she added.
