SEOUL, April 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea held interest rates steady at 2.50 percent on Thursday for the 11th consecutive meeting, in line with all analysts forecasts, as new Governor Lee Ju-yeol headed his first policy committee meeting.

******************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Full story [ID:nS6N0LH002] - All 31 analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast the central bank would keep the rate unchanged. Eighteen out of the 24 analysts who gave views on the future policy change predicted the Bank of Korea would raise rates late this year. [ID:nL4N0MW1HH]  COMMENTARY: RONALD MAN, ECONOMIST, HSBC HONG KONG "Recent economic data suggest that trade has started to pick up and, in turn, Korea remains on track for an export-led recovery. But the momentum is low: export growth slowed in 1Q." "A severe deterioration in export growth may trigger a rate cut. So far, Korea's trade has held its own despite the weaker yen. But if Japanese exporters take more advantage of the weaker yen and become price competitive, then pressure on Korean exporters may raise." "We believe Governor Lee will strike a delicate balance between inflation and growth data. However, when price pressures show signs of building up again in the economy, Governor Lee may prefer to hike pre-emptively to avoid inflation from exceeding the central bank's target." MOON HONG-CHEOL, FIXED-INCOME ANALYST, DONGBU SECURITIES  "As of now, indicators point to a prolonged period of base rate being held. But with small improvements (in the economy), it will be supportive of a rate hike." "For the BOK to cut rates, there needs to be a strong downside risk like a faltering Chinese economy." "Given Lee's BOK background, he will probably put more focus on inflation data compared to Kim."  MARKET REACTION:
