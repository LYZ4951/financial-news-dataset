MILAN, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. investment fund BlackRock <BLK.N> has a 6.85 percent stake in the EI Towers <EIT.MI> unit of Italian broadcaster Mediaset <MS.MI>, according to filings of market regulator Consob released on Thursday.

The stake was bought by the U.S. group on April 4, Consob said. Last week Mediaset raised 284 million euros ($393 million) from the sale of a 25 percent stake in its broadcasting towers unit EI Towers.
