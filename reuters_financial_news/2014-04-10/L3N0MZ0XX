HONG KONG, April 11 (Reuters) - AIA Group Ltd <1299.HK> reported a 22 percent rise in value of new business in the first quarter of 2014, higher than expected as China, Hong Kong and Singapore delivered strong growth.

The company's value of new business, which measures the expected profits from new premiums, rose to $354 million in the first quarter, above the average 18 percent growth expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The new business margin rose to 43.8 percent, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Friday.
