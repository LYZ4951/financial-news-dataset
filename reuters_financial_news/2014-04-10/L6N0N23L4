MOSCOW, April 10 (Reuters) - Russia's finance ministry said on Thursday that it would resume purchases of foreign currency for its reserve fund from April 14, with the volume equivalent to 3.5 billion roubles ($98 million) daily.

The ministry said that the volume of forex purchases would be halved to 1.75 billion roubles if the rouble weakens against a dollar-euro basket into the range bordering the edge of the corridor where the central bank increases its interventions.
