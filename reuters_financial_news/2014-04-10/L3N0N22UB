MUMBAI, April 10 (Reuters) - Indian shares retreated from record highs hit earlier in the session to end flat as profit-taking hit blue chips such as Infosys Ltd <INFY.NS> on caution ahead of the release of quarterly earnings and inflation data next week.

Next week marks the start of quarterly earnings reports, while India will also release consumer price inflation data, in the midst of a five-week elections.
