April 10 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL * A major cybersecurity flaw called "Heartbleed" that exposes encrypted information to hackers has forced the Canada Revenue Agency to shut down its filing system and push back the deadline for online returns. The flaw has got major websites around the world to release software updates to patch a hole that leaves users' personal information vulnerable.

Embassy officials are also looking at compensation for workers whose stays in China stand to permanently damage their health.

Chen, who took over the struggling company in November, said BlackBerry was also looking to invest in regulated industries such as healthcare, and financial and legal services, all of which require highly secure communications.

The secrecy surrounding the act, the failure to consult in advance of its drafting, the curtailment of debate after, the supreme indifference to legitimate criticism - all under the chilling oversight of the Minister for Democratic Reform, Pierre Poilievre, would be enough to make anyone nervous.

The bug leaves behind no trace when it is exploited and it may take years before the extent of this security breach is fully known. (http://r.reuters.com/kuk48v)
