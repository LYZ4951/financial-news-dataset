HELSINKI, April 10 (Reuters) - Finnish conglomerate Aspo <ASU1V.HE> on Thursday reported better than expected first-quarter results, soothing worst fears of the impact from Ukraine crisis to the Russian-exposed company and sending its shares higher

Aspo, which makes about 30 percent of its sales in Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries, said its first-quarter operating profit rose to 3.8 million euros ($5.3 million) from 0.9 million a year earlier, surpassing analysts' average expectation of 2.9 million euros, as compiled by Valuatum. Aspo shares were up 9.6 percent to 5.71 euros by 1220 GMT. The company, reporting non-audited information, said the decline of Russian rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia cut its euro-denominated sales but did not substantially hurt the profit.
