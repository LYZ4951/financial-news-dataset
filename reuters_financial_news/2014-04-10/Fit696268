April 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Delinquency rates on recently issued U.S. RMBS remain  near zero nearly four years after the first post-crisis transaction was  completed, according to Fitch Ratings in its new U.S. prime jumbo RMBS monthly  trends report. Of the roughly 20,000 loans securitized since the start of 2010, only two loans  are currently over 60 days delinquent. When loans that are only one payment  behind are included, the total delinquency as a percentage of the remaining  loans is only 18 basis points.  'The exceptionally strong credit performance for post-crisis RMBS reflects the  unusually high credit quality and tight loan underwriting of the mortgage  pools,' said Grant Bailey, Managing Director at Fitch. Volatile prepayment behavior has also been a distinguishing characteristic of  the recent transactions.  After spiking to annualized prepayment rates above 60%  in 2012, most transactions are currently prepaying at rates below 10%. Fitch's new report will be published monthly and highlights collateral and  performance trends in new issue RMBS. It is available at www.fitchratings.com or  by clicking on the below link.
