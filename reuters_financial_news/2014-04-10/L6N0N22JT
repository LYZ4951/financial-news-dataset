DUESSELDORF, April 10 (Reuters) - Erste Abwicklungsanstalt (EAA), the bad bank tasked with winding down assets of failed German state-backed bank WestLB [WDLG.UL], is planning to sell property lender Westimmo [WDLGW.UL] by the end of the year.

"The market for bank assets it picking up, that's why we will shortly launch the privatisation of Westimmo," EAA Chief Executive Matthias Wargers said on Thursday. Investors will be approached no later than the end of June over the sale of the lender, which has 10 billion euros ($13.8 billion) in assets, he added.  The renewed attempt to sell Westimmo comes more than two years after exclusive talks with private equity investor Apollo <APO.N> failed in late 2011.
