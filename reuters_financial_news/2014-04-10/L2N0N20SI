RIO DE JANEIRO, April 10 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Thursday said it expects Brazil's next government to support its credit rating by making policy adjustments that improve its fiscal performance and boost investor confidence.

In a conference call with investors, Fitch analyst Shelly Shetty said low growth rates and a deterioration in fiscal accounts are the firm's main concern about Brazil.
