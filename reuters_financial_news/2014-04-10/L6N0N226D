LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - European shares turned negative in choppy trade on Thursday, with traders citing a big sale of Euro STOXX 50 futures while disappointing industrial output figures from Italy and France dented sentiment. [ID:nR1N0HJ02B] [ID:nP6N0KN024]

The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.5 percent at 1,330.85 points by 0943 GMT, retreating from an intra-session high of 1,345.34. Trading volume on the cash index was thin, at just over a third of its 90-day daily average. Charts, however, showed a spike in volume on the Euro STOXX 50 June future <STXEc1> from 0830 GMT as the contract swung into negative territory. Traders said this fall fuelled selling pressure on other indexes.
