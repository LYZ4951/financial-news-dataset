MADRID, April 10 (Reuters) - Share trading in Spain's Iberdrola <IBE.MC> has been suspended due to circumstances that could affect the normal trading of the shares, the stock market regulator said on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Spanish nationalised lender Bankia <BKIA.MC> said it was placing a 4.94 percent stake in Iberdrola in an accelerated bookbuild at a price range of 4.85 euros to 5.002 euros each, valuing the stake at about 1.6 billion euros ($2.2 billion).
