WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER JASON FURMANON PROSPECT OF G7 PUSHING FOR MORE FINANCIAL AID FOR UKRAINE"I don't want to characterize that discussion but you certainly know where we are coming from on the broader issue involving the Ukraine. It's something that we approach very much from the perspective of national security, but we also understand what the economic implications are for the global economy and that's something we take seriously as well." IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRISTINE LAGARDEON LOW INFLATION:"We are concerned about this potential risk of advanced economies in general, in the euro area in particular, that prolonged low inflation will hurt both growth and jobs. In this context, it is encouraging that the ECB reiterated its commitment to use unconventional measures as needed."  ON CHINA FX "I took the recent increase of the band of the renminbi as the move in the direction of internationalization. I won't characterize it as an intended depreciation of the currency. Certainly we welcome the internationalization of the renminbi." "In terms of China's contribution to international growth, clearly China is playing a clear role with 7.5 pct growth. It is clearly contributing significantly."  RUSSIA/ UKRAINE "The Ukrainian program ... has been negotiated on the ground, it has been discussed formally with the board and there has been encouraging, very broad-based support from all corners of the board of the IMF."  JAPAN/ABENOMICS "It's fair to say the first arrow delivered has begun to work ... We were very pleased to see the (commitment to raise the) sales tax to 8 percent was delivered upon. "Medium-term fiscal plan needs to be articulated ... and we hope to see them. In the third arrow, there are many reforms, many changes of structural nature that has been touched on but not completely articulated.... I will certainly discuss what the time table is." EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK BOARD MEMBER PETER PRAETON EURO AREA GROWTH:"The latest data confirm that the euro area on aggregate is proceeding slowly along the path of economic recovery." "Yet ... some euro area countries are experiencing steady growth, while in others growth remains anemic."  INDIA CENTRAL BANK CHIEF RAGHURAM RAJAN ON FED MONETARY POLICY GUIDANCE: "We have no doubt there is a need for exit... some language on contingency related to what happens to the rest of the world would also be useful."  ON COMPETITION BETWEEN CENTRAL BANKS:   "The current non-system in international monetary policy is, in my view, a source of substantial risk, both to sustainable growth as well as to the financial sector. It is not an industrial economy problem, nor an emerging market problem, it is a problem of collective action. We are being pushed towards competitive monetary easing."  ON EMERGING MARKET ADJUSTMENT TO RICH NATIONS' EASY MONEY POLICY: "We all have our constraints. It's not that emerging markets have infinite ability to adjust and so we should keep that in mind going forward."  ON DIFFERENCES WITH NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT:   "I haven't had any discussion with the new government. I think this is all press-invented differences and I think it should be seen as such. It's speculation rather than any actual differences."  ECB VICE PRESIDENT VITOR CONSTANCIO ON POSSIBILITY OF QE IN EURO ZONE: "Our experts have been looking into it, and building scenarios, but no decisions have been taken." "Several members of the Governing Council have made public statements that indicate that private assets will be included in any decision that may be taken. We are looking into what assets would be easier to operate, if indeed we would take such a decision."  ON EURO ZONE INFLATION/MONETARY EASING: "This is an important consideration in terms of data because there are base effects and to have a better view of where inflation is right now we have to take the average of the two months not just the figure for March." "The April number will be important to have a view if indeed we have reached on a more permanent basis low inflation levels or the March figure was just a blip, so that's absolutely important."  ON CALL FOR GLOBAL 'SAFETY NET' "We have to design a better multilateral liquidity safety net so that countries do not feel they are on their own in managing market turmoil, and so that they do not build enormous stockpiles of reserves." "Multilateral arrangements are tried and tested, and are available more widely, and without some of the possible political pressures that could arise from bilateral and regional arrangements." "Swap arrangements can be channeled through multilateral institutions like the IMF instead of being conducted on a bilateral basis." MEXICAN CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AGUSTIN CARSTENS ON IMPACT OF FED TAPERING ON EMERGING MARKETS: "What happened last year was an important wake-up call." "It's important for emerging markets to keep strong fundamentals, to keep a very strong position." "If you manage to really separate yourself with these strong policies, I think you  might be able to do well. What emerging markets should be looking into is to establish the expectation that you have the policies in place. That in time will compress the country risk and that should, in a way, give ground for the country to absorb higher ... interest rates."  ON WHEN HE SEES U.S. INTEREST RATES RISING: "I shared Raghuram Rajan's view, which was that he expected it to happen in the second half of next year." "I think what really makes sense is to see if the Fed is providing enough guidance and information for markets to adjust in a smooth and proper way. I think more than fixating on when or in what particular moment it will be, I think what I'm more interested in is how the process of conducting monetary policy in the U.S. is evolving." "So far I think they (the Fed) have done things quite well."
