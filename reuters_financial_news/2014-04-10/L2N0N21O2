April 10 (Reuters) - It is possible that the recent weakness in the broader U.S. stock market won't last, given expectations for improved economic growth and still-low interest rates. But the high-flyers, whose soaring fortunes fed risk appetite through 2013, are likely to keep struggling.

A primary reason is supply. Most investors who bought the likes of Netflix or Twitter in 2014 are sitting on losses, and as long as sentiment in these names is sour, investors are likely to use any jump in those stocks as an opportunity to cut losses. Thursday was a case in point. After two days of recovery in momentum stocks, the high-flyers turned south, with the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC.> falling 3.1 percent, its worst day since November 2011. "I would imagine any bounce from these levels is probably going to be met with supply because the market is on very tenuous legs right now," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.  Investors who bought into a group of 24 notable high-growth stocks this year are in most cases under water. This can be calculated by looking at the volume-weighted average price on the shares for the year; what it shows is ugly.  "They bought at the wrong time based upon where the shares are now," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. "This means there is a high likelihood there will be overhead supply when the shares rally as investors seek to unwind the losing trades."  Netflix is a good example. Headed into Thursday, the stock's volume-weighted average share price for 2014 was $385.91. But on Thursday the stock closed at $353.03, or 8.5 percent below the average price investors have paid for the shares this year.  Some of what's happened is a rotation into the likes of value stocks, even technology names that are considered more staid in this market, like Microsoft <MSFT.O> or Intel <INTC.O>. The average price paid for Microsoft this year is just $37.85.  The stock closed at $39.36 on Thursday, so the average investor in the software giant is up on the year.  What follows is a list of 24 high-growth stocks as identified by Credit Suisse. Many of them were strong in 2013, only to falter this year. The chart shows that most of these names are currently trading at prices lower than the average investor purchase price for 2014.COMPANY   Avg YTDClosing PricePercentagePrice  4/10/14  Difference  Twitter <TWTR.N>  $56.81 $42.49   -25.2  3D Systems$71.90 $54.68   -23.9  <DDD.N> Solarcity $71.17 $57.51   -19.2  <SCTY.O>Pharmacyclics $125.90$103.15  -18.1  <PCYC.O>Splunk <SPLK.O>   $78.09 $65.04   -16.7  Theravance$35.15 $29.62   -15.7  <THRX.O>Medivation$73.50 $62.50   -15.0  <MDVN.O>Netsuite <N.N>$102.30$87.33   -14.6  Incyte <INCY.O>   $60.80 $52.01   -14.5  Concur <CNQR.O>   $111.44$95.37   -14.4  Homeaway  $41.34 $35.68   -13.7  <AWAY.O>Tableau Software  $83.73 $72.87   -13.0  <DATA.N>Workday <WDAY.N>  $94.28 $83.02   -11.9  Pandora Media $33.44 $29.77   -11.0  <P.N>   Seattle Genetics  $47.43 $42.27   -10.9  <SGEN.O>Stratasys $117.16$104.37  -10.9  <SSYS.O>Servicenow$61.15 $54.88   -10.3  <NOW.N> Vertex Pharma $77.97 $69.95   -10.3  <VRTX.O>Biomarin Pharma   $73.21 $65.80   -10.1  <BMRN.O>Netflix <NFLX.O>  $385.91$353.03  -8.5  Illumina  $150.18$145.84  -2.9  <ILMN.O>Alexion Pharma$159.02$155.86  -2.0  <ALXN.O>Wynn Resorts  $217.21$220.30  +1.4  <WYNN.O>Tesla Motors  $206.41$216.93  +5.1  <TSLA.O>Source: Datastream
