FRANKFURT, April 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank reiterated in its monthly bulletin on Thursday its determination to intervene should inflation remain low for too long.

As usual, the editorial of the bank's bulletin was virtually identical to its main policy statement, read out by ECB President Mario Draghi last Thursday, when the bank kept its main interest rate on hold at 0.25 percent. "We are resolute in our determination to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation and to act swiftly if required," the ECB said.  "It (the Governing Council) is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation," the ECB said. Below is a list of articles and special sections the bulletin contains. The articles can often shed light on the ECB's thinking about key issues and give an insight into the type of analysis the bank uses to support its policy decisions. * Is the unemployment rate a sound gauge of labour market developments in the United States? * Recent developments in debt securities issued by non-financial corporations in the euro area * Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework for monetary policy operations * Potential measurement issues in consumer price indices * Slack in the euro area economy   "...slack in the euro area economy, as measured by different types of indicator, is still considerable and is likely to dampen upward pressure on inflation." "A common feature of all forecasts (from international institutions) is that the gap is expected to close only gradually and to remain negative over the period 2014-16." * Factors behind the fall and recovery in business investment * Euro area sectoral value added growth and the Purchasing Managers' IndexARTICLES * The ECB's forward guidance  * Fiscal multipliers and the timing of consolidation
