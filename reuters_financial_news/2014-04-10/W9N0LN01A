WELLINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices rose for a second consecutive month in March, while the number of houses sold also increased, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Friday.

The REINZ said demand in the two main cities of Auckland and Christchurch was outstripping supply and driving prices to record highs, while the rest of the country was looking easier in part because of limits on lending. Limits on how much retail banks can lend on low deposit home loans have been in place since last October by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to slow the rise in house prices. The central bank started raising interest rates last month and has signaled a steady tightening programme over the next two years. It has said the state of the housing market will be a key factor in the timing and extent of rises. [NZ/POLL] Earlier this week, a report from government valuation agency QV showed house price growth eased for a fourth consecutive month.
