MILAN, April 10 (Reuters) - A Milan prosecutor on Thursday recommended that former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi should serve his one-year sentence for tax fraud doing community service, as requested by Berlusconi's lawyers, a judicial source said.

Lawyers for the media tycoon earlier asked for their client to serve his sentence helping out in a home for the disabled.
