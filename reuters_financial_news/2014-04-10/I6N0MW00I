MILAN, April 10 (Reuters) - Italy's Anima Holding is set to price its initial public offering at 4.20-4.25 euros per share, the top of a revised range, valuing the asset manager at 1.26 billion euros ($1.75 billion), three market sources said on Thursday.

"It should be priced at the top of the range," one of the sources told Reuters. Anima, which narrowed the IPO price range to 4-4.25 euros from 3.5-4.5 euros on Wednesday, declined to comment. A price of 4.25 euros would allow existing shareholders Clessidra, Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI>, Popolare di Milano <PMII.MI> and Prima Holding, which are selling down part of their stakes in the IPO, to raise around 700 million euros.
