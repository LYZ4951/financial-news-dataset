MOSCOW, April 10 (Reuters) - Russia's second largest bank VTB <VTBR.MM> <VTBRq.L> said on Thursday it aimed to grow profits by nearly 80 percent in 2016 but that profits this year may be harder to achieve due to provisions related to Ukraine risks.

VTB said in a presentation of its next three-year strategy that it aimed to grow profits to 160-180 billion roubles ($4.5 - $5 billion) in 2016, from 101 billion last year.
