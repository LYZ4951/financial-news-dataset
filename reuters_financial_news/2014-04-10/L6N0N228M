COPENHAGEN, April 10 (Reuters) - Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO> will on Friday repay the loan of 24 billion Danish crowns ($4.44 billion) raised from the Danish state in 2009 in a move that is seen slashing its funding costs by as much as 1 billion crowns per year.

Investor confidence in the bank hit a nadir in early 2009 with its market capitalisation falling to 23 billion crowns or some 23 percent of the book value. Access to funding markets was more or less closed but the state loan helped boost confidence. Denmark's biggest bank tried to pay back the money in 2011 but failed to reach an agreement with the government about the terms for the repayment. April 11 this year is the first day the bank according to the original agreement can repay the loan, which came with an interest rate of about 9.6 percent. "The repayment is of high value for the pride internally at the bank," analyst Christian Hede from Nordea Equity Research said. But the repayment will also lower the bank's funding cost since it is able to raise funding in the market at a lower price than the state loan. "It marks the end of a difficult period, and it means we will have net savings of up to 1 billion crowns per year in funding costs," Danske Board Chairman Ole Andersen told shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting last month. He told shareholders it had been an expensive but necessary loan.  Danske Bank declined to comment on Thursday on the planned repayment.
