LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - Emerging market-focused fund manager Ashmore Group plc <ASHM.L> said assets under management slid further in the March quarter when $6.2 billion was pulled from its funds.

The bulk of the outflows, $4 billion, were from funds used to provide currency hedging for investment portfolios. Smaller net outflows were seen in its local currency, blended debt and multi-strategy funds. The outflows were offset partially by a positive investment performance of $1 billion, it added in a statement. Ashmore's assets under management closed the quarter at $70.1 billion.  Investment themes that performed well in the quarter included external debt and blended debt, local currency and corporate debt. The other investment themes were broadly flat.
