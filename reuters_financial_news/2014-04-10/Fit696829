April 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded DSI Holdings  Limited's (DSIHL) National Long-Term Rating to 'BBB(lka)' from 'BBB+(lka)'. The  Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. The downgrade reflects Fitch's view that the footwear company's net leverage -  measured as consolidated lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBTIDAR - is  likely to remain at over 4.25x in the medium term. DSIHL's leverage has been  driven higher due to weaker cash flow following the imposition of 12% retail VAT  in Sri Lanka effective January 2013.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Negative Impact from VAT: DSIHL is the market leader in a fragmented retail  industry targeting a relative price-sensitive segment, and the imposition of the  retail VAT has hurt the group's competitive position. The VAT applies to  retailers with quarterly revenue exceeding LKR250m, which leaves the larger  industry players shouldering a bigger cost burden. Faced with increased price  competition and weaker consumer purchasing power, DSIHL's sales volume fell  markedly when it tried to raise prices gradually to recover the additional VAT  burden.  Market Leader in Footwear: DSIHL's rating continues to reflect its market  leadership in domestic footwear, supported by its well-known in-house brands,  diverse product range and its extensive distribution network of over 200 retail  and 90 wholesale points. Key risks include competition from small and medium  scale manufacturers, volatility in prices of imported raw materials and exchange  rate fluctuations.  Domestic footwear manufacturers are protected by high tariffs on footwear  imports. A weak balance of payments and support for local industry underpins the  likelihood the current high tariff regime will continue. Fitch also believes  DSIHL's brand and distribution strengths should, to a certain extent, help  protect its market position if import tariffs were removed or reduced sharply.  High Leverage: DSIHL's net leverage increased to 5.0x in the financial year  ended 31 March 2013 from 3.7x at FYE12, mostly due to declining profitability  and despite paying down debt following inventory liquidation at end FY13. Fitch  expects its leverage to remain above 4.25x due to continued weakness in consumer  purchasing power, the VAT's impact on cash flows, and as DSIHL's debt levels  return to its usual levels to fund working capital expenditure and capex. Fitch  expects EBITDAR margins to only show gradual improvement over the medium term as  the company incorporates the VAT into pricing and implements cost controls,  including a shift towards a franchise model. Parent's Other Investments Sound: DSI Samson Group (Pvt) Ltd (DSG) fully owns  DSIHL and controls the subsidiary's cash flows. DSG's operations consist mainly  of DSIHL and Samson Rubber Industries (Pvt) Ltd (SRI), a company engaged in the  manufacture and export of bicycle and other tyres. SRI's profile continues to  remain sound with leverage trending lower (1.6x at 9M14 from 3.2x at FY13).   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: -Net leverage above 5.5x on a sustained basis   -EBITDAR to Interest and operating lease rental coverage falling below 1.3x  (FY13:1.1x)  -A weakening of DSG's credit profile Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include:  -Net Leverage below 4.25x on a sustained basis and  -EBITDAR margins above 12% on a sustained basis
