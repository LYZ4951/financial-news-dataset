ATHENS, April 10 (Reuters) - Greece's bond issue will bolster sentiment throughout Europe, which is still struggling with the impact of the debt crisis, European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Thursday.

"It's extremely good news... and it will reinforce confidence in Europe to overcome the crisis," he told reporters in Athens after meeting Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras.
