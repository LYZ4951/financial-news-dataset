April 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that equity will be  the main driver of convertible bond (CB) funds' performance in 2014, with  volatility as a supplementary factor, as the sector continues to attract strong  flows from institutional investors. This shift by CB funds towards an equity profile reflects a tactical positioning  as well as the increasing proportion of equity-like CBs relative to hybrids in  the market. The evolution of funds from a "balanced" to an "equity like" profile  may reduce asymmetry of returns (ie. convexity).  CB funds have continued to experience strong inflows so far in 2014 from  institutional investors who are looking to add equity exposure to their fixed  income portfolio, extending a trend seen last year. Most flows went to global  funds which represent around 50% of the total CB fund universe. However,  relative to assets under management (AUM), flows were roughly evenly split  between regions. In total, CB's AUM grew about 40% since January 2012. Demand exceeds supply on the small USD450bn CB market. "Imbalances between  supply and demand on the CB market challenge the ability of portfolio managers  to build positions at an attractive price and diversify portfolios while  remaining selective," says Manuel Arrive, Senior Director in Fitch's Fund and  Asset Manager Rating team. Managing capacity is becoming an issue for large funds, but Fitch has not found  any evidence that size impaired performance. The agency expects synthetic  instruments and options to be increasingly used to mitigate size and supply  constraints.
