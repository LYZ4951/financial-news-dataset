April 10 (Reuters) - African budget airline Fastjet Plc <FJET.L> said it raised 11 million pounds ($18.42 million) through a private placement of shares, including a 1 million pound investment from a unit of easyGroup Holdings.

The offering of 687.5 million shares was priced at 1.6 pence per share, representing a discount of 11.1 percent to the stock's closing on Wednesday. [ID:nRSJ5710Ea] The placement will more than double the number of the company's shares. The airline, which aspires to be the first pan-African low-cost carrier, had said earlier this month it was in talks with a number of potential investors including easyGroup, the private investment vehicle of billionaire Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
