April 10 (Reuters) - Malaysia-based International Islamic Liquidity Management Corp (IILM) will reissue $860 million of its three-month Islamic bond next week, after expanding its issuance programme to $1.35 billion in January.

The auction of the three-month sukuk, rated A-1 by Standard and Poor's, will be conducted on Apr. 17, according to a filing lodged with Malaysia's central bank. In February, the IILM sold $490 million worth of three-month paper, designed to meet a shortage of highly liquid, investment-grade financial instruments which Islamic banks can trade to manage their short-term funding needs.
