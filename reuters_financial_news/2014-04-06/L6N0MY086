KIGALI, April 6 (Reuters) - Atlas Mara, an investment company backed by former Barclays <BARC.L> boss Bob Diamond, said on Sunday it planned to buy a controlling stake in state-run Development Bank of Rwanda to build a regional financial services firm.

"We are acquiring the government's stake through this process which is just over 75 percent," Diamond told a news conference, where Rwanda's finance minister, Claver Gatete, said the deal had yet to be finalised but welcomed the investment.
