DUBAI, April 6 (Reuters) - Riyad Bank <1010.SE>, Saudi Arabia's third-largest lender by assets, posted a 13.5 percent increase in first-quarter net profit on Sunday, broadly in line with analysts' estimates.

The bank made 1.08 billion riyals ($288 million) in the three months ending March 31, compared with 951 million riyals in the same period of 2013, it said in a stock market statement. It cited an increase in total operating income - which climbed 12 percent year-on-year to 1.93 billion riyals - for the profit rise without elaborating.
