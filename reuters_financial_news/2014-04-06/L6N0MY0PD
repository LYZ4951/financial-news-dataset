PARIS, April 6 (Reuters) - French cable company Numericable <NUME.PA> will launch a rights issue worth up to 4.7 billion euros ($6.44 billion) to help fund its acquisition of Vivendi <VIV.PA> unit SFR, Numericable said on Sunday.

Numericable won a fierce month-long bidding war against mobile rival Bouygues <BOUY.PA> for the prize of SFR on Saturday when Vivendi announced it had decided to go with Numericable's offer, which combined 13.5 billion euros in cash, a 20 percent stake in the combined entity and a potential milestone payment. [ID:nL5N0MX0DL] The takeover promises to reshape Europe's third-biggest telecoms market after two years of brutal price competition brought on by the arrival of low-cost rival Iliad <ILD.PA> into the mobile arena. Following the planned rights issue, which will be guaranteed by the holding company of Numericable's billionaire backer Patrick Drahi, the remainder of the cash payout - up to 8.8 billion euros - will be backed by debt financing, Numericable said. Drahi and other executives will give more details at a press conference on Monday, the statement said. Drahi's company Altice <ATCE.AS> will own 60 percent of the combined entity with Vivendi owning 20 percent and the remainder floated on the stock market.
