PARIS, April 6 (Reuters) - The world's two largest cement makers, France's Lafarge <LAFP.PA> and Switzerland's Holcim <HOLN.VX>, have agreed the terms of a merger that would create a company with a stock market value of around $55 billion, a source close to the situation said on Sunday.

The companies are due to communicate officially on the proposal on Monday and have already begun to address possible competition concerns that would arise from the tie-up, the source added.
