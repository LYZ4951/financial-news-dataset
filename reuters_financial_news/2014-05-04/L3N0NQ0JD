SYDNEY, May 5 (Reuters) - Australian regional bank Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd <BEN.AX> said on Monday it plans to buy state-owned Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria for A$1.78 billion ($1.65 billion), a move it said would quadruple the size of its rural loan book.

Bendigo, based in Victoria, Australia's second most populous state, said it will undertake a A$230 million share placement to institutional investors, as well as sell new shares in a separate public offer to finance the acquisition.
