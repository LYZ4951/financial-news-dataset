NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Citigroup, Nomura, Jefferies, Barclays and Deutsche Bank have committed to provide $6.95 billion of debt to finance the $8.7 billion buyout of PetSmart Inc <PETM.O>, according to a regulatory filing. The pet store announced Sunday that it had agreed to be purchased by a private equity consortium led by BC Partners.

The debt package consists of $6.2 billion in debt, expected to be split between roughly over $4 billion of loans and just under $2 billion of bonds, according to a source. The company is also lining up a $750 million asset-backed revolver, according to the regulatory filing.  The sizable buyout financing would put the company's leverage at approximately 6.5 times according to numbers PetSmart released Sunday when the deal was announced. The company's Ebitda for the 12 months ending November 2 was approximately $956 million based on the $8.7 billion price tag equaling a 9.1 times multiple.  As previously reported, several other banks backed away from providing funding for the LBO deal in recent days on concerns that the leveraged buyout, which is the largest of the year, might not pass muster with U.S. regulators.  The equity check will be more than $2 billion, said a source familiar with the deal.  Standard and Poor's put PetSmart's BB+ credit rating on negative watch, noting that it's leverage would jump north of 5.0 times from 1.5 times. The ratings agency said the pro forma metrics and new private equity ownership would be consistent with a B rating.  PetSmart said on Sunday it had agreed to sell itself to the private equity consortium for $8.7 billion, or $83 per share.  BC Partners' co-investors include La Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec and StepStone.
