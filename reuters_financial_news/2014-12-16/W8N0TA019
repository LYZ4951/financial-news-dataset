WARSAW/VIENNA, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Eastern-Europe focused Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) <RBIV.VI> is looking to sell Raiffeisen Polbank, Poland's eighth-largest lender by assets, three market sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

"Raiffeisen's Polish unit is for sale," one source with knowledge of the matter said.
