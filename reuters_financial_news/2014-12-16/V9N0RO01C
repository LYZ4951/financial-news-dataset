VIENNA, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling sees little prospect for a quick settlement with German bank BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] in compensation talks over Vienna's 2009 nationalisation of lender Hypo Alpe Adria, he said.

Asked by reporters how settlement talks were progressing, he said: "At the moment...it does not appear that we will come to a result in the short term." He reiterated that Austria could file suit over the emergency nationalisation by an end-2014 deadline.
