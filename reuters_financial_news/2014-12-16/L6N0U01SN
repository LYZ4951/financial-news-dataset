LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Russian sovereign dollar bonds fell on Tuesday as an aggressive interest rate hike to defend the rouble failed to convince investors the central bank had turned the tide on a developing financial crisis.

Russia's bond maturing in 2043 <78307ADH3=> was trading 3.5 cents lower at 76.87 cents in the dollar. A bond maturing in 2030 <XS011428878=TE> was down 1.2 cents to 98.56 in the dollar.
