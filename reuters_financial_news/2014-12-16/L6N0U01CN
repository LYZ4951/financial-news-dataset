MOSCOW, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Russian central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Tuesday the rouble's weakness was driven by external factors such as falling oil prices and Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

In an interview with Rossiya-24 television, she also said the weakening of the rouble was a signal for the economy to adapt to new conditions.
