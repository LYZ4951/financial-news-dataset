MILAN, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday to fresh all-time lows as Italy's banking index slid lower.

At 0910 GMT, Monte Paschi shares were down 2.2 percent at 0.5130 euros after earlier touching a historic low of 0.5040 euros and following losses of around 8 percent on Monday. Monte Paschi needs to plug a hole in its capital base following the results of a euro zone health check of European banks.
