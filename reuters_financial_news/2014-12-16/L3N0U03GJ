JAKARTA, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets extend losses on Tuesday after a fall in the Russian rouble triggered a sell-off in emerging markets due to global risk aversion.

The slump in the rouble on the back of falling oil prices and Western sanctions has sent emerging market investors into a panic, analysts said, prompting U.S. dollar buying which hurt local currencies and stock prices in Southeast Asia.  Russia's central bank sharply hiked interest rates early on Tuesday to support the currency, but after a brief recovery the rouble fell to a new all-time low against the dollar.
