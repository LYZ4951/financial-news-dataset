STOCKHOLM, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Stockholm City Court ruled on Tuesday that Swedbank's <SWEDa.ST> acquisition of the real estate broker Svensk Fastighetsformedling from Norwegian bank DNB <DNB.OL> violates Swedish competition law.

The acquisition of Svensk Fastighetsformedling, which was announced exactly a year ago, would lead to a concentration of ownership that would harm competition since Swedbank already owns the real estate broker Fastighetsbyran, the court said.
