JAKARTA, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Indonesia's government said on Tuesday it is prepared to buy back government bonds from the secondary market if needed, after outflow pressures pushed the yield on its 10-year benchmark bonds to 8.514 percent, the highest since Oct. 1.

"For policy response, we always monitor bond market and we are prepared to buy back bonds if bond market is under pressure," Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said in a joint press conference with the central bank. Bank Indonesia senior deputy governor Mirza Adityaswara said the central bank is in the bond and the rupiah foreign exchange markets to smooth out volatility. On Monday,  when the rupiah <IDR=> tumbled, BI also said it was in both markets.
