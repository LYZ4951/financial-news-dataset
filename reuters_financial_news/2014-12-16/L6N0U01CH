LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Shares in eastern-Europe-focused Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> hit an all-time low on Tuesday, hit by a slide in the Russian ruble and growing concerns about the country's economy.

Raiffeisen Bank International, among others, relies heavily on profits from Russia, which are under pressure as the economy buckles and the rouble drops amid Western sanctions and weak energy prices. [ID:nL6N0TZ1XO]
