LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> said on Tuesday it still had work to do to build up its defences against potential losses after it narrowly passed a Bank of England stress test.

"We recognise that there is still much work to be done to improve the resilience of our balance sheet," Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a statement.
