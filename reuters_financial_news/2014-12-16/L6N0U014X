MOSCOW, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The rouble hit a new record low against the euro on Tuesday and trimmed gains against the dollar after an overnight rate hike by Russia's central bank failed to bolster the currency for long as oil prices dropped sharply.

The rouble opened around 9 percent stronger against the dollar following the 650 basis point rate hike, but then fell back in volatile trade.
