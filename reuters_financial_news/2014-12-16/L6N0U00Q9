DUBAI, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The oil price plunge is likely to have a significant impact on state revenues in the Gulf Cooperation Council, but GCC nations have big reserves so in general they will not need to cut state spending significantly, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Tuesday.

Harald Finger, the IMF's head of mission for the United Arab Emirates, was speaking at a financial conference attended by senior UAE economic officials. As a matter of prudence, GCC countries should now rein in state spending, but they should do it in a gradual way to avoid hurting economic growth, Finger said.
