MUMBAI, Dec 16 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index slumped as much as 2.1 percent on Tuesday, marking its biggest daily fall in more than five months, on worries a weakening rupee amid continued global turmoil may force the central bank to delay expected cuts in interest rates.

The Indian rupee <INR=D2> hit a 13-month low on Tuesday after Russia's sharp increase in interest rates reinforced concerns about the global economy at a time when oil prices are sliding, while a downbeat China factory survey also weighed. [MKTS/GLOB] Among blue-chips, ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> provisionally lost 4.2 percent, while ITC <ITC.NS> declined 3.3 percent. The NSE index <.NSEI> unofficially fell 1.85 percent to its lowest close since Oct. 28.
