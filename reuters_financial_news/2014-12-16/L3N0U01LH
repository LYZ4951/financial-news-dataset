BANGKOK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Thailand's benchmark stock market index fell 3.4 percent on Tuesday before paring that loss as investors unloaded big-cap energy and bank shares.

At 0306 GMT,  the benchmark SET index <.SETI> was down 2.74  percent, after dropping as far as 1,427.89, the lowest since June 2. Turnover was 6.2 billion Thai baht ($187.76 million). The energy sector index <.SETEN> was down 3.2 percent and the bank sector index <.SETB> dropped 2.5 percent.   The Thai market rebounded on late Monday after falling to a seven-month low and suffering its biggest intraday percentage fall in six years as the slide in global oil prices hurt energy companies.
