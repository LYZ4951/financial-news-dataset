Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street's industry-funded regulator, fined Bank of America Corp's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch unit $1.9 million for unfair pricing related to the purchase of distressed securities over two years.

Merrill Lynch's global banking and markets credit trading desk had bought senior notes of Motors Liquidation Co <MTLQU.PK>, formerly General Motors Corp, at 5.3 percent to 61.5 percent below the market price in more than 700 retail customer transactions, FINRA said.
