MOSCOW, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Russia's top bank Sberbank <SBER.MM> plunged over 18 percent on Tuesday, while the rouble-denominated MICEX index <.MCX> was up around 2.6 percent, helped by the weaker rouble.

Sberbank is seen as a barometer for the wider Russian economy, and the collapsing rouble is denting investor confidence in Russia.
