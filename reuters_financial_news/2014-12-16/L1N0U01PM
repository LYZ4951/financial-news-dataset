NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Russia's rouble traded on two separate foreign exchange trading platforms on Tuesday despite extreme volatility in the currency.

EBS, owned by London-based broker and Gain Capital said it is business as usual in terms of rouble trading. The ICAP subsidiary has been a major provider of liquidity for the rouble the last few years. In the case of Gain, the company said it increased the margin requirement for trading in the U.S. dollar/rouble to 20 percent from 2 percent. This means that customers who want to deal in the currency pair should deposit at least 20 percent of the total funds required for the trade.
