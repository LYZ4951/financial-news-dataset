PARIS, Dec 16 (Reuters) - French Environment Minister Segolene Royal called on Tuesday for a freeze next year in the tolls charged to motorists for use of the country's motorways.

The government considers the operators' contracts to be too generous and plans to create a new regulator to oversee motorway tolls. Royal said that overall, she expected the motorway operators to "make an effort" amounting to 1 billion euros ($1.25 billion). She did not elaborate.
