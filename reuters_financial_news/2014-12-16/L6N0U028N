LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - An outgoing executive at Britain's financial watchdog apologised on Tuesday for his role in the botched announcement of a review into life insurance policies that sent shares in insurers tumbling in March.

An independent inquiry said last week the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was wrong to brief a reporter about the review and "seriously inadequate" in the way it dealt with the ensuing sell-off in insurance shares. [ID:nL6N0TU2BQ] The report was critical of FCA Supervision Director Clive Adamson who announced days before the report was released that he would be leaving the regulator as part of structural changes. [ID:nL6N0TS2X6] Adamson apologised on Tuesday during an appearance before a parliamentary committee that scrutinises the financial services industry. "I absolutely regret what happened. I take responsibility for my part in that and I apologise," Adamson said. "I think we all accept it is a very serious incident and I think we have all realised the influence and power the organisation (FCA) does have." In March, panicking investors dumped shares in Aviva <AV.L>, Legal & General <LGEN.L> and Prudential <PRU.L> after Adamson, the FCA's head of supervision, was quoted in The Daily Telegraph as saying the regulator would investigate if those locked in pension pots had been treated fairly. [ID:nL5N0MP1TW] Investors feared insurers would face huge compensation bills, but the FCA took six hours after the market opening to clarify that the review did not intend to look into mis-selling.
