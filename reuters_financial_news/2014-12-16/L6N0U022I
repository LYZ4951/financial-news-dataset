MOSCOW, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Sberbank <SBER.MM>, Russia's top lender, sees its cost of risk next year at around the same level as this year, two analysts said, after meeting the bank's executives on Tuesday.

Both analysts, who asked not to be named, said state-controlled Sberbank saw its 2015 return on equity - a key measure of profitability - close to 10 percent rather than around 15 percent as previously forecast.
