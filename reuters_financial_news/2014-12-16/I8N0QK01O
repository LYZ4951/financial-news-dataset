MUMBAI, Dec 16 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index slumped as much as 2.1 percent on Tuesday to head towards its biggest daily fall in more than five months as the turmoil in global markets is raising concerns the central bank will delay cuts in interest rates.

Global markets tumbled as a downbeat China factory survey and Russia's sharp increase in interest rates reinforced concerns about the global economy at a time of sliding oil prices.
