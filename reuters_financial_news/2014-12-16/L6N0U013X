LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The yen hit a one-month high against the dollar on Tuesday as investors bought currencies traditionally seen as safe havens amid a slide in oil prices that has triggered a bout of volatility across asset classes.

The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 117.07 yen <JPY=>, its highest level in a month, as the Russian rouble came under renewed pressure and European stock markets fell back into the red.
