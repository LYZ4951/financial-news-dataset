SAO PAULO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Itaú Unibanco Holding SA will continue to sell insurance assets that are not strategically key to Brazil's most profitable bank, Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal said on Tuesday.

Itaú plans to focus on insurance operations in low-risk segments, Setubal told shareholders at an event in São Paulo. Management will concentrate efforts on cost and expense controls next year, since the outlook for revenue in lending and financial services remains difficult, he added.
