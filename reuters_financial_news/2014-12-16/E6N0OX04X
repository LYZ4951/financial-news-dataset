SAO PAULO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, Latin America's largest bank by market value, has no immediate plans to buy a rival overseas as an ongoing decline in Brazil's currency is making foreign acquisitions more expensive, a senior executive said on Tuesday.

"With the dollar gaining ground and staying at a high level, it is hard to think of potential overseas transactions at this point," said Alfredo Egydio Setubal, Itaú's senior vice president for investor relations, at a São Paulo event.
