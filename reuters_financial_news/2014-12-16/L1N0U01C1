NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday sold $40 billion of one-month or four-week bills at an interest rate of 0.02 percent, the lowest level since a one-month bill auction held on Oct. 28, Treasury data showed.

The ratio of the amount of bids submitted to the amount of one-month bills that mature on Jan. 15, 2015 <912796EP0=> offered was 3.28, which was the weakest since 2.75 at an auction held Oct. 8, 2013. [ID:nZXN0DC600]
