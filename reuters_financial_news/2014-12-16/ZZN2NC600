HONG KONG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished down on Tuesday, ignoring a rally on mainland exchanges that saw the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> break back above 3,000, considered a key psychological resistance level.

The Hang Seng index <.HSI> fell 1.6 percent, to 22,670.50, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> lost 0.7 percent, to 11,136.90 points.The increasing disconnect between sentiment in Hong Kong and Shanghai is evident in the A-H share price index, which closed up at 119.69 on Tuesday, its highest level since November 2011. A value above 100 indicates Shanghai shares are pricing at a premium to shares in the same company trading in Hong Kong. Among the most actively traded stocks on Hong Kong's main board were CCT Land <0261.HK>, down 5.6 percent to HK$0.02  Unity Investment Holdings <0913.HK>, down 37.0 percent to HK$0.05 and Landing International <0582.HK>, up 48.9 percent to HK$0.34. Chinese investment flowing from Shanghai into Hong Kong through the mutual market access pilot programme took up 0.39 billion yuan of the 10.5 billion yuan daily quota <.SQUOTA.HS>. Total trading volume of companies included in the HSI index was 2.2 billion shares.   (Editing by Richard Borsuk)  Keywords: MARKETS HONGKONG STOCKS/CLOSE
