COPENHAGEN, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Danish government's bond issuance requirement for next year should come in at 75 billion Danish crowns ($12.6 billion), up from 100 billion issued this year, the country's central bank said on Tuesday.

The target for the outstanding volume in T-bills by end-2015 is 30 billion crowns, the central bank said. The central bank said in a separate announcement that if the need arises it will support the crown's peg to the euro by adding crown liquidity to the Danish money market for shorter periods.
