LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Dollar bonds of Russian companies suffered another fall on Monday as a dramatic overnight central bank rate hike struggled to stabilise a falling rouble.

Bonds from oil major Lukoil <LKOH.MM > fell 4 cents in the dollar <US549876AH32=R> while Rosneft <ROSN.MM> saw its greenback denominated debt fall more than 2 cents <XS086198118=TE>. Banks such as VEB and Russian Agricultural Bank <XS063095087=TE> <XS030099877=TE> saw their dollar issues tumble by up to 0.9 cent in the dollar on expectations that the rouble's collapse will trigger a rise in bad loans. Sberbank's 2017 dollar issue <XS074238041=TE> is now trading at 88.9 cents in the dollar, after starting the year trading well above par.
