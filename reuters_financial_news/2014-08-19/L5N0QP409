JOHANNESBURG, Aug 19 (Reuters) - South Africa's central bank said on Tuesday it did not agree with the reasons given by Moody's ratings agency to downgrade the country's four biggest banks.

"The South African banking sector remains healthy and robust," the South African Reserve Bank said in a statement disputing Moody's action.
