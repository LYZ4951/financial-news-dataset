SHANGHAI, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares ended at more than six-year highs on Tuesday, in a catch-up to strong global markets and buoyed by strength in property companies.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> rose 0.7 percent to 25,122.95 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong edged up 0.3 percent.  "Recently looking at the U.S and Europe markets, we have been lagging behind other markets for some time because of the weakness of the Asian market," said Alex Wong, a director at Ample Finance Group.
