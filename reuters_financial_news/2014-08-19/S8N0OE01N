DUBLIN, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Ireland's permanent tsb <IPM.I> (PTSB) is likely to be attractive to private investors well before the government had expected, finance minister Michael Noonan said after the lender reported a sharp drop in losses on Tuesday.

The 99 percent state-owned mortgage lender cut its first-half underlying loss by 62 percent compared to a year ago after impairment charges on loans fell by two-thirds. [ID:nL5N0QP0TL]
