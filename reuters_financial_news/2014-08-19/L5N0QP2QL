LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR <KKR.N> has appointed Rothschild to carve out and sell the public sector division of its software firm Northgate Information Solutions [NINFO.UL], two sources familiar with the situation said.

The sale could be worth around $600 million and will be marketed to private equity funds in an auction which will kick off later this year, one of the sources said. Northgate Public Services (NPS), which provides IT solutions to police and local government agencies in the UK, expects to generate a turnover of 195 million pounds ($324.40 million)in the fiscal year ending April 2015 with core earnings of 50 million pounds ($83.18 million), the second source said. KKR acquired Northgate Information Solutions in a take-private deal in 2008 valuing the company at 593 million pounds ($986.51 million).
