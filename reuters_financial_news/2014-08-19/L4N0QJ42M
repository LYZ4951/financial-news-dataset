HONG KONG, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Canadian retailer Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc <ATDb.TO> and China's Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> are among suitors short-listed to buy a $16 billion minority stake in China's Sinopec Sales, the world's largest fuel retail network, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

China Life Insurance Co Ltd <601628.SS>, the nation's biggest insurer, Hong Kong-listed ENN Energy Holdings Ltd <2688.HK> privately-owned Fosun Group, Hopu Investment Management and Affinity Equity Partners have also progressed to the next round, the people added. Final bids are due by end-August, though it was not clear how many shortlisted bidders are likely to make offers. Formally known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>, state-run Sinopec plans to sell up to 30 percent of the business by end-2014 as Beijing restructures state-owned assets.
