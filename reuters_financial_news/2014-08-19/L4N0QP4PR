Aug 19 (Reuters) - Southeastern Grocers LLC, which operates supermarket chains Winn-Dixie and BI-LO, said on Tuesday it would withdraw its plans for an initial public offering.

The Jacksonville, Florida-based company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in September for an IPO of up to $500 million. Southeastern Grocers did not specify a reason for pulling its IPO plans. (http://1.usa.gov/1kSevmU)
