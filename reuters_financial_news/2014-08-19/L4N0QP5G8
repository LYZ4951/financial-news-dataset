SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen slipping at the open on Wednesday as investors continue to digest a batch of earnings delivered this morning, though the uptick on Wall Street and in metals prices may buoy the market.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> slipped 0.1 percent to 5,575.0, a 48.8-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark added 0.7 percent on Tuesday, its fourth consecutive session of gains.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> added 0.2 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended higher for the second straight session on Tuesday, as robust housing data and strong earnings from Dow's Home Depot overshadowed lingering concerns about the conflict in Ukraine. * Aluminium prices rose on Tuesday, supported by a short-term shortage of available metal, while copper dipped on persistent concern about expected additional supply. * Gold futures eased, under pressure from buoyant equities markets and a stronger dollar after upbeat U.S. economic data, and palladium sank from Monday's 13-year high as traders booked profits. * AGL Energy Ltd <AGK.AX>, Australia's No.2 gas and electricity retailer by sales, booked a 3.9 percent fall in underlying annual net profit as it experienced a warmer-than- expected winter and demand for energy fell. * Brambles Ltd <BXB.AX>, the world's largest supplier of pallets, reported 5 percent growth in annual net profit on Wednesday but missed estimates as strong revenue growth was outweighed by severe U.S. weather conditions and higher costs.

[ID:nWNBS00MUK] * Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPL.AX> reported a 33 percent increase in half-year underlying profit as output from the Pluto liquefied natural gas project increased and prices rose.
