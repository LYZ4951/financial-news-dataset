JAKARTA, Aug 19 (Reuters) - PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia Tbk (BRI) <BBRI.JK> said on Tuesday it is exploring a potential acquisition of state-owned Indonesian life insurer PT Asuransi Jiwasraya.

Bank Rakyat is at an early stage of reviewing the potential acquisition, the state-controlled lender said in a stock exchange filing. Bank Rakyat said in January it had earmarked 3 trillion rupiah ($256.9 million) for possible acquisitions of other lenders as well as insurance and securities firms. [ID:nL3N0KW1JR] Jiwasraya posted a 69 percent jump in net profit to 460.9 billion rupiah in 2013 from a year earlier, according to its annual report. Indonesia's life insurance sector has seen a spate of acquisitions in the past one to two years as companies seek to capitalize on the low coverage and attractive growth rates in Southeast Asia's largest economy. Britain's Aviva <AV.L> is partnering Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International Tbk <ASII.JK> to sell life insurance products, while Japan's Sumitomo Life Insurance Co <SMTLI.UL> and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co Ltd <8750.T> have bought stakes in Indonesian insurers.
