LJUBLJANA, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Slovenian President Borut Pahor nominated legal expert Miro Cerar as prime minister on Tuesday following a July election won convincingly by Cerar's newly-formed centre-left SMC party.

Parliament has seven days to confirm the appointment of the 50-year-old political novice, who has expressed reluctance to sell some of the bigger state assets slated for privatisation under a drive to steady Slovenia's finances after the euro zone member narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks late last year.
