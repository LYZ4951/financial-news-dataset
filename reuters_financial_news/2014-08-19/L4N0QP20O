SEOUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - South Korean shares rallied on Tuesday to their highest close in two weeks on broad-based buying as hopes for easing of tensions in the Ukraine crisis lifted equities around the world.

The benchmark KOSPI <.KS11> jumped 0.9 percent to end at 2,071.14 points, its strongest close since setting 2,080.42 points on Aug. 4. An upgrade by investment bank HSBC of its rating on South Korean shares to 'neutral' from 'underweight' also lent support, although the immediate impact was limited due to remaining caution over the U.S. interest rate policy.
