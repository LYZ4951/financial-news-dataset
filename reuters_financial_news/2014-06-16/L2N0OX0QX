BUENOS AIRES, June 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Argentina's appeal over its bid to avoid paying $1.33 billion to hedge fund creditors or risk a potential default.

The high court left intact lower court rulings that ordered Argentina to pay. The government had previously warned it could default on its sovereign debt if required to pay in full. [ID:nL2N0OX0FV] Analysts made the following comments:  MAXIMILIANO CASTILLO, DIRECTOR AT ACM CONSULTANTS "It wasn't really what the market or analysts were expecting. The key today rests with the government, there are no more legal channels. I think they will have to comply. "The margin of negotiation they could have (with judge Thomas Griesa) relates to how the money is paid. The around 1.3 billion that has to be paid, has to be paid."   SEBASTIAN CENTURION, ECONOMIST AT ABC EXCHANGE "It's a slap in the face. Although the official (exchange rate) won't move, there could be greater demand for the (black market) blue or the blue chip swap rate, as they are the only tools that people have to cover themselves. "The truth is that this is surprising because it is giving a precedent for any 'vulture fund' to go against any country, so any country is vulnerable in a restructure, so this is bad news for other countries."  MARCO LAVAGNA, HEAD ECONOMIST AT ECOLATINA CONSULTANCY "It's a very damaging scenario for Argentina. We will have to wait and see how Griesa ends up implementing this. Maybe something could open up there and allow for negotiation without putting at risk the pari passu clause, which expires in December."  GUSTAVO BER, ESTUDIO BER ECONOMIST "The reaction will be generally unfavorable, as this attitude from the Court was not expected. We could have a volatile day today...with bets in reverse as the market was pricing in that (the Court) would at least take up the case."  JOSE LUIS ESPERT, ESTUDIO ESPERT ANALYST "Now the judgement that obliges payment stands. That means (Argentina) obeys and pays or enters into default-default, as it's no longer technical default. Bonds should fall on the news."  SIOBHAN MORDEN, JEFFRIES HEAD OF LATIN AMERICAN STRATEGY "The initial claim is around 1.5 billion but there could be some other tag along liabilities, we have to see what the extent is of these and whether all of them would be willing to negotiate and accept payment in kind. And that is assuming Argentina is willing to negotiate."
