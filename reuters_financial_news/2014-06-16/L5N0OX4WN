FRANKFURT, June 16 (Reuters) - Family-owned Hella, a German manufacturer of auto headlights and electronics parts, is considering listing its shares on the stock market, two sources said on Monday.

One of the sources said Hella [HELLA.UL] was considering launching an initial public offering (IPO) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The second source said the firm had asked a bank, Bankhaus Lampe, for advice on the appetite for such a listing among institutional investors. A spokesman for Hella however said that although the company had the option to review its ownership from time to time, there were no formal plans to pursue a stock-market listing. Banking sources said Hella had explored a listing in 2013 but shelved the plans.  German weekly WirtschaftsWoche reported that Hella was exploring a listing because some members of the owning family were thinking about selling their stakes.
