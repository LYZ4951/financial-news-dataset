BANGKOK, June 16 (Reuters) - Thai shares rose on Monday as stocks of large-cap telecoms firms recovered from the previous week's losses, while others in Southeast Asia saw buying interest in energy-related stocks as tensions in Iraq boosted crude oil.

Mobile phone operator Total Access Communication Pcl <DTAC.BK> led the gains in the Thai stock market after a positive broker view. The stock jumped 5.1 percent, the top percentage gainer on the 50 large-cap share index <.SET50>. It dropped 17 percent last week after a fund raising plan by rival True Corp <TRUE.BK> raised prospects of increased competition in the industry. [ID:nL4N0OQ1V7] Broker CIMB Securities (Thailand) said DTAC was its top pick in the country's telecoms sector. "We understand that DTAC is the most vulnerable if True is stronger. However, we have noticed that True's service proposition of leadership in mobile broadband technology, coverage and convergence challenges AIS's core competency more than DTAC's," it said. Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> rose 1.4 percent, while True Corp was up 0.6 percent. The key SET index <.SETI> was up 0.7 percent at midday. It fell 0.2 percent last week partly due to a selloff in telecoms shares. Optimism around the ruling military government's planned budget spending also helped underpin sentiment, brokers said. "This week, investors should closely watch the National Council for Peace and Order decision toward the 2015 budget, especially the 450 billion baht investment of dual-tracking and mass transit," said broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities. Across the region, shares of energy and plantation firms outperformed. Singapore-listed Keppel Corp <KPLM.SI>, the world's top offshore drilling rig builder, rose to its highest since April 22. Thailand's energy explorer PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK> hit its highest since Jan. 24. PT Astra Agro Lestari Tbk <AALI.JK>, Indonesia's largest listed plantation firm, gained more than 1 percent, on strong palm oil prices. Malaysian palm oil futures rose for a third straight day on Monday as a spike in crude oil prices continued to stoke demand for the tropical oil.
