June 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Baidu  Inc.'s (Baidu; A/Stable) US1bn 2.75% senior unsecured notes due 2019 a final  rating of 'A'. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected  rating assigned on 4 June 2014. The notes are rated at the same level as Baidu's  Issuer Default Rating as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and  general obligations of the company.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Dominant Market Position: The ratings reflect Baidu's dominance in the internet  search market in China with a traffic market share of over 70% on PC and mobile  combined. The company has also achieved a clear lead in China's mobile search  market. The ratings also benefit from Baidu's strong profitability and balance  sheet, reflecting its ability to generate cash from its proven  performance-based, online marketing service that is used by over 700,000  advertisers to reach hundreds of millions of Chinese internet users, and its  strong pricing power. Strong Competitive Advantages: Fitch believes that technological innovation plus  high levels of brand recognition and consumer satisfaction enable Baidu to  consistently defend its high market share in a rapidly growing market. The  company continues to invest to improve natural language processing, deep  learning, artificial intelligence, image recognition, voice technology, use of  big data, location-based services and mobile search, further strengthening its  technology leadership. It also has nurtured good relationships with the  government and regulatory bodies. Solid Performance: Baidu's revenue grew 59% yoy in 1Q14, driven by robust mobile  traffic growth, continued adoption of its mobile search products and enhanced  monetisation of these products. Mobile revenues accounted for over 20% of 1Q14  revenues. EBIT margin fell to 25% in 1Q14 from 35% in 2013, reflecting increased  spending on channel and marketing, infrastructure, content and traffic  acquisition to strengthen its market position in the mobile arena. Fitch expects  Baidu's margin to recover after the transition to develop its mobile platform. Strong Cash Generation: Baidu generated free cash flow (FCF)/sales of over 30%  for 2008-2013. Including short-term investments, where the company parks its  surplus cash, Baidu had unrestricted cash of CNY8.8bn and near cash of CNY30.9bn  at end-March 2014, which together is equivalent to 219% of its total debt. Fitch  expects Baidu to maintain strong financial flexibility and ample liquidity over  the medium term. Foreign Ownership Restrictions: Chinese law restricts foreign equity ownership  of internet, online advertising and employment agency companies in China. Baidu  operates its websites in China through contractually controlled consolidated,  affiliated Chinese entities. These variable interest equity (VIE) arrangements  are the usual mechanism for overseas investors to participate in China's  restricted sectors and are a credit weakness as they may not be as effective in  providing control as direct ownership or may face legal challenges in the  future. VIE Weaknesses Mitigated: Baidu generates over 70% of revenues from, and keeps  almost all the cash and assets within, its wholly owned subsidiaries in China  rather than at the contractually controlled, consolidated affiliated entities.  Fitch is reassured by the alignment of Baidu's and the affiliates' objectives  and the company's continuing good relationship with the government and  regulatory authorities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - evidence of greater government, regulatory or legal intervention leading to an  adverse change in the company's operations, profitability or market share - decline in operating EBIT margin to below 10% (35.0% in 2013) - decline in pre-dividend FCF/sales ratio to below 10% (31.7% in 2013) - increase in funds flow from operations-adjusted leverage to above 2x (1.7x for  2013)
