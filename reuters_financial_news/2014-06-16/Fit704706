June 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded BBVA 3 FTPYME, TDA's class C  notes and affirmed the class B notes as follows:  Class B notes affirmed at 'AA+sf', Outlook Stable Class C notes upgraded to 'Asf' from 'BBBsf', Outlook Stable BBVA 3 FTPYME is a cash flow securitisation of loans to small- and medium-sized   Spanish enterprises (SMEs) granted by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria <BBVA.MC>.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade reflects strong increases in credit enhancement due to natural  amortisation of the underlying portfolio over the last 12 months. Since then,  the class A2(G) notes were repaid in full and class B notes have been amortised  to 28% of their initial balance, from 43% a year ago. Consequently, credit  enhancement on the class B notes has increased to 93% from 53%.  Overall the transaction's portfolio has deleveraged to 2.3% of its initial  balance, down from 3.3% a year ago. This has led to a marginal increase in  portfolio concentration, a trend that Fitch expects to continue with further  amortisation. Defaults have increased over the last 12 months to 19% from 11%,  whereas delinquencies of over 90 days decreased significantly to 0.99% of the  outstanding balance from 4.12%.  The rating of the class B notes is constrained by the rating cap of 'AA+'/Stable  for Spanish structured finance transactions.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
