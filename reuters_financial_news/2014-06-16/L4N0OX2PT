BANGALORE, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro zone's overnight interbank lending rate will not hold below zero for a sustained spell following the ECB's introduction of negative deposit rates, according to a Reuters poll of traders.

Spot Eonia <EONIA=>, the rate at which banks lend to each other, dipped below zero during intraday trade on Monday and was fixed at a record low of 0.026 percent at the end of last week. While that could suggest recent policy easing measures by the European Central Bank to boost lending were working, 14 of 23 traders said the overnight bank-to-bank rate was unlikely to fall into negative territory for long. "It is counter-intuitive and a result of excess liquidity," said a money market trader. "If liquidity stays the way it is, we will see some pressure on the Eonia rate, but I think it will come back to just above zero." The amount of cash euro zone banks have beyond what they need for their day-to-day operations <ECBNOMLIQ=> stands at 113 billion euros, well above the three-year low of 70 billion euros hit at the end of last month. A smaller take-up at the ECB's weekly tenders will squeeze some cash out of the system and the wider poll of 23 traders said banks will borrow 120 billion euros ($163 billion) at this week's auction, compared to 137 billion euros maturing from last week.
