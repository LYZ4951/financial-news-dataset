MILAN, June 16 (Reuters) - Italian lottery operator GTECH <GTCH.MI> said on Monday it was in preliminary talks to buy Las Vegas-based slot machine maker International Game Technology <IGT.N>.

"This transaction could potentially involve the use of a mix of cash and equity as consideration," GTECH said, adding it did not anticipate needing a cash call to fund the acquisition. GTECH said it had hired advisers to help it in the talks.
