COPENHAGEN, June 16 (Reuters) - Jyske Bank <JYSK.CO> will cut 177 full-time jobs with the aim of eventually bringing down the number of full-time employees to approximately 4,000, Denmark's second-biggest bank said on Monday.

The bank had 4,444 full-time employees at the end of May. "Several jobs will be cut with immediate effect, and this will unfortunately result in the lay-off of 92 employees," Jyske Bank said in a statement.
