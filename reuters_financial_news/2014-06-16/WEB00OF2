STOCKHOLM, June 16 (Reuters) - Swedish private firm EQT [EQT.UL] has picked Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and SEB <SEBa.ST> to lead a stock market listing of hotel operator Scandic, two people familiar with the matter said.

The sources declined to be identified because the plans are not yet public. EQT, which owns 78 percent of Scandic, declined to comment, as did Scandic and the banks.
