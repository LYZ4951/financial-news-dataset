SEOUL, June 16 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> eased against the dollar for a third straight session on Monday, as rising tension in Iraq dented appetite for riskier assets although the downside was contained by demand from exporters.

The currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,020.1 per dollar at the end of onshore trade, the weakest close since June 5 and down 0.2 percent from Friday's 1,017.8. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> finished up 0.1 percent at 1,993.59 points, after Friday's 1 percent decline, which was the worst daily percentage fall in seven weeks.
