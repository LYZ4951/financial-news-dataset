June 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sydney Airport Finance  Company Pty Limited's [SAFC.UL] senior secured bank debt and bonds at 'BBB'. The Outlook  is Stable. The affirmation takes into account Sydney Airport's strong asset profile as seen  by its long-term resilience and steady growth in revenue and passenger numbers.  As Australia's largest airport, serving the greater Sydney population of 4.8  million, it is a major gateway to Australia with international passengers  representing 41% of Australia's total. The rating is constrained by moderately  high leverage and a high, but manageable, refinancing requirement.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Sydney Airport has predominantly O&D traffic, and is the only major airport  serving the greater Sydney region. The airport serves 39 airlines in total with  moderate carrier concentration with the Qantas Group and Virgin Group. While  domestic traffic growth has been subdued at 1.2% CAGR over the past three years  (2011-2013), average growth of international traffic (which is around four times  as profitable per passenger) has been robust at 4.0%, driving total revenue CAGR  of 5.7%. Momentum is increasing toward a second airport in the Sydney region,  which could create a competitor in the future. However, Sydney Airport has the  first right of refusal over the development rights for the second airport, which  is not expected to be operational before the mid-2020s at the earliest. Fitch  has assessed the Volume Risk attribute as Stronger. Unlike some large peer airports in Europe or the US, pricing at Sydney Airport  is not regulated. The airport is free to negotiate commercial agreements  directly with airline customers, subject only to monitoring by the government.  Nonetheless, given the generally weak financial profiles of the airline  carriers, the ability to maximise revenues by raising passenger charges is  judged to be limited. Therefore, Fitch assesses the Price Risk attribute as  Midrange. Infrastructure Development and Renewal risk is assessed as Midrange. Annual  improvements are required and planned but are broadly volume-driven. There is  some flexibility to defer capex, if required. The 'Necessary New Investment'  (NNI) framework allows for recovery of growth capex through aeronautical  charges. All of growth capex is expected to be debt funded, although it could be  funded from cash flows if equity distributions were decreased. Sydney Airport  expects to invest AUD1.2bn on growth capex from 2014-218, however there is some  uncertainty around the timing and quantum of investment after 2018. Sydney Airport's debt structure consists mainly of bullet maturities, which  creates refinancing risk. However, Sydney Airport has successfully accessed the  capital markets on multiple occasions, extending its average debt tenor and  spreading maturities over numerous years. Management has a proven record of  successfully managing refinancing well in advance, as evidenced by the May 2014  AUD2.5bn financing in the Euro bond and Australian bank markets. Nonetheless,  tight liquidity in financial markets brought about by crises situations (such as  the GFC) could push up costs significantly even if access to funding is not  completely blocked. Reserve accounts, liquidity lines and distribution triggers  help reduce the risk somewhat. Overall, the Debt Structure Risk attribute is  assessed as Midrange. Net Debt/EBITDA was 7.0x for 2013 and stays in the 7.0-7.3x range over the  10-year forecast period in Fitch's Rating Case, which assumes annual passenger  growth between 1.5% and 2.4% over the next 10 year forecast period. Fitch's  Traffic Stress Case, which reflects sharp (5%) declines in traffic in each of  the next two years, results in Net Debt/EBITDA increasing to more than 8x in  2015-17, then falling back below 8x as traffic is assumed to recover somewhat.  Management does not intend to amortise debt, preferring equity distributions  instead, and growth capex is likely to be fully debt funded. The minimum ICR  (over 10 years) in the Rating Case is 1.8, well above the 1.4x lockup ratio. Fitch compared Sydney Airport with international peers of similar leverage,  notably Heathrow, Gatwick, Brussels and Copenhagen. Sydney Airport experienced  much lower traffic volatility than the other airports in the higher leverage  bracket. This reflects the airport's quite distinct economic drivers, notably  the growth in international travel from Asia and the solid performance of the  Australian economy. However, the airport's resilience to a major downturn in  these factors is yet to be established.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
