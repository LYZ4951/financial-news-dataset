TOKYO, June 16 (Reuters) - Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), the world's biggest pension system, should quickly enact changes to its investment portfolio management strategy, a draft of the government's growth strategy showed on Monday.

The pension fund must improve its governance as it changes its investment strategy, the draft said. The government is also considering legislation to change GPIF's legal structure, the draft said.
