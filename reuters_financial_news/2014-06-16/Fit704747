June 16 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Resolutions from a single 2007-vintage deal brought  U.S. CMBS delinquencies down to a level not seen in over four years, according  to the latest index results from Fitch Ratings. CMBS delinquencies declined 16 basis points (bps) in May to 4.97% from 5.13% a  month earlier. This marks the first time the rate has stood below 5% since  December 2009. The decline was led by a handful of dispositions from the JPMCC  2007-LDP10 transaction, including two loans over $50 million. The largest new delinquency was the $60 million Clark Tower loan (JPMCC  2007-CIBC20), which fell 60-days delinquent last month. By property type,  industrial experienced the largest decline in delinquencies last month (24 bps). Current and previous delinquency rates are as follows:  --Industrial: 6.43% (from 6.67% in April); --Multifamily: 5.92% (from 5.97%); --Office: 5.22% (from 5.43%); --Hotel: 5.12% (from 5.18%); --Retail: 4.98% (from 5.11%).
