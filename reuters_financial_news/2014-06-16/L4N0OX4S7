MELBOURNE, June 17 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open a touch lower on Tuesday on worries about sliding iron ore prices, the threat of U.S. air strikes in Iraq and an escalating dispute over Russian gas supplies to Ukraine.

* Share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.1 percent to 5,411.0, a 6-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 0.1 percent on Monday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was flat at 5,178.8 in early trade. * U.S. stocks closed slightly higher on Monday, supported by a flurry of merger news, but trading was choppy as turmoil in Iraq drove oil prices up. * Rising oil and copper prices could ease some of the pain in the local resources sector. Copper rose from last week's one-month low on Monday as investors took heart from China's efforts to stem any growth slowdown, and concerns over a Chinese investigation into warehousing fraud faded. * Spot iron ore fell below $90 a tonne to its lowest price since September 2012 on Monday, reflecting plentiful supply and tighter credit that has slowed purchases by Chinese mills despite a more than 30 percent plunge in prices this year. * Investors are waiting for mining contractor Mineral Resources Ltd <MIN.AX> to announce a proposal by Wednesday to trump a $1 billion bid for Aquila Resources Ltd <AQA.AX> from China's Baosteel Resources and Australian rail operator Aurizon Holdings Ltd <AZJ.AX>.----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2235 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1937.78  0.08% 1.620 USD/JPY <JPY=>   101.82  -0.01%-0.010 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.597   --  #N/A SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1271.64  0.03% 0.350 US CRUDE<CLc1>   106.64  -0.24%-0.260 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16781.01 0.03%  5.27 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  147.62   0.00%  0.00 -------------------------------------------------------------* Wall St ends up slightly on M&A; Iraq closely watched   [.N]   * Brent crude climbs as Iraq conflict fuels supply worry [O/R]   * Gold retreats from near 3-week high on profit taking  [GOL/]   * Copper rises on China growth pledge  [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB] DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
