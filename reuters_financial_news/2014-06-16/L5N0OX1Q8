DUBAI, June 16 (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates-based lender National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah <RAKB.AD> (RAKBANK) has given initial price thoughts in the area of 170 basis points over midswaps for its benchmark-sized five-year debut bond, a document from lead managers said.

RAKBANK, rated BBB+ by Fitch, is due to conclude meetings with fixed income investors in London on Monday. It expects to price a deal this week, the document said. The sixth-largest lender by market value listed on the Abu Dhabi stock exchange, RAKBANK has chosen National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> and Standard Chartered <STAN.L> to arrange the bond sale. Traditionally, benchmark size is understood to mean at least $500 million.
