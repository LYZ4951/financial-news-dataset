SYDNEY, June 16 (Reuters) - Australian engineering services company UGL Ltd <UGL.AX> confirmed the cash sale of its property arm to a consortium of TPG Capital Management <TPG.UL>, PAG Asia Capital and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan for A$1.215 billion ($1.14 billion).

Sydney-based UGL put global real estate services company DTZ up for sale a year ago to cut debt as its main engineering services division faces declining revenues due to a slowdown in the Australian mining sector.  The vendor will net A$1 billion to A$1.05 billion after sale costs and is considering "a range of options for the efficient use of net proceeds", UGL said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday.
