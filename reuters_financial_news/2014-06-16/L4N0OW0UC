SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares slipped 0.2 percent on Monday, hovering around 3-1/2-week lows, as banking stocks pulled the index lower and iron ore fell to a fresh 21-month low.

Investors also exercised caution as the unrest in Iraq continued.  The United States ordered military personnel to boost security for its diplomatic staff in Baghdad on Sunday and said some staff were being evacuated from the embassy as the Iraqi government battled to hold off insurgent forces. [ID:nL2N0OW0FA] All of the major banks fell with Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> slipping 0.3 percent and Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> down 0.4 percent. Among mid-tier banks, Bank of Queensland Ltd <BOQ.AX> was down 0.9 percent.  "The major banks have struggled amid fears of more stringent regulation," said Niall King, sales trader at CMC Markets in a note.  The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> dipped 10.7 points to 5,393.7 by 0144 GMT. The benchmark fell 0.4 percent on Friday, and was down 1.1 percent last week, its third consecutive week of losses.  Some miners eked out a gain with BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> adding 0.4 percent and Iluka Resources Ltd <ILU.AX> up nearly 2 percent. Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> slipped 0.2 percent.  "I think the news is that people are still worried about China given that iron ore prices have continued to fall," said Damien Boey, equities strategist at Credit Suisse in Sydney. "As you look at the domestic data it is starting to look a little bit worse, so a mixture of local and Chinese concerns are continuing to weigh on the market, the geopolitical stuff (in Iraq) is probably there in the margin." UGL Ltd <UGL.AX> lost 0.7 percent after the Australian engineering services company confirmed the cash sale of its property arm to a consortium for A$1.215 billion. TPG Telecom Ltd <TPM.AX> added 0.5 percent.[ID:nL4N0OX0BS] Echo Entertainment Group Ltd <EGP.AX> bounced 7.8 percent to A2.99, its highest since July 2013 after upgrading its FY 2014 EBITDA to between A$430 million to A$435 million.
