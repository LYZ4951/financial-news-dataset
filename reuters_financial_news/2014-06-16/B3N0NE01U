BUDAPEST, June 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the exchange rate risk borrowers took on when getting a foreign currency loan could be considered unfair only if borrowers could not realistically assess the scale of possible shifts in market rates.

In a landmark ruling that Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government plans to use as a legal template to get rid of the toxic loans, the court also said the practice of banks applying different exchange rates when disbursing the loan and when repayments were due was unfair.
