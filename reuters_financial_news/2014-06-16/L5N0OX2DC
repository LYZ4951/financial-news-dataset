LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has fined Credit Suisse International <CSGN.VX> and Yorkshire Building Society for failing to ensure that financial promotions for a product were clear, fair and not misleading.

The FCA said in a statement on Monday it fined Credit Suisse International 2.4 million pounds ($4 million) and Yorkshire Building Society 1.4 million pounds. The watchdog said the Cliquet product was designed by the Swiss bank to provide capital protection and a guaranteed minimum return, with the apparent potential for significantly more if Britain's FTSE 100 share index performed consistently well.
