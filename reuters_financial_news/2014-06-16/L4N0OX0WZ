MUMBAI, June 16 (Reuters) - The Indian rupee weakened to 60 to a dollar on Monday, its lowest in more than a month, as strong demand for the greenback from oil marketing companies weighed after global crude prices surged to nine-month highs on Friday.

At 0404 GMT, the rupee <INR=D2> was at 59.9850/9900 after hitting 60.00, a level last seen on May 12. The pair had closed at 59.76/77 on Friday.
