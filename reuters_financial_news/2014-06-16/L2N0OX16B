June 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear Argentina's appeal over its battle with hedge funds that refused to take part in its debt restructurings, a move that risks sending Latin America's No 3 economy into a fresh sovereign default.

Investors dumped Argentine debt after the the court left intact lower court rulings that ordered Argentina to pay $1.33 billion to the so-called holdouts who refused 2005 and 2010 debt swaps in the wake of its 2001-02 default on $100 billion. [ID:nL2N0OX0TI] Argentina has previously refused to pay up. If it sticks to that position, U.S. authorities could prevent full payment to creditors holding restructured bonds even though the country is able and willing to pay them. This could result in a default as early as June 30, when payments are due on discount bonds governed by New York. Argentina's country risk <11EMJ>, as measured by the J.P. Morgan EMBI+ Index, rose nearly 10 basis points on the news, while Argentine stocks <.MERV> were down nearly 4 percent. Investors had not expected the adverse decision from the court.
