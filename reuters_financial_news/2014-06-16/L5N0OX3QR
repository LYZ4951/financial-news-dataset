VIENNA, June 16 (Reuters) - Rebel investor Alexander Proschofsky has filed suit in a bid to overturn his narrow failure last month to join the administrative board of Austrian property group Conwert <CONW.VI>, which he wants to shake up.

He said his Cube Invest vehicle asked the Commercial Court in Vienna to nullify resolutions passed at a turbulent Conwert annual meeting on May 7. [ID:nL6N0NT4ZP] "A success of Cube's legal action will immediately result in the retroactive appointment of Peter Hohlbein and Alexander Proschofsky as of May 7, 2014 - a repetition of the annual general meeting will not even be required," a statement said. Hohlbein is a Berlin property consultant and Proschofsky ally who also lost his bid for a board seat to the company's preferred candidate.  Conwert believes that the election result was legal, a company spokesman said.
