STOCKHOLM, June 16 (Reuters) - Swedish banks, welfare providers and real estate companies risk bigger tax bills in the future as politicians across the board seek to close loopholes in line with proposals from a government-appointed committee.

The commission published its proposals last Thursday and said its plan would limit companies' ability to claim tax deductions for interest expenses, while adding that this could in turn help pay for a tax cut in the general corporate rate. Sweden will hold a general election in September, with the centre-left opposition the clear favourites in opinion polls. Firms that deliver publicly funded welfare services have faced particularly tough criticism for avoiding taxes by borrowing money from associated companies and then deducting the cost of interest. The public commission suggested write-offs for interest expenses should be tax deductible only against other financial income, while today they are deductible against all corporate income. Deductions for net financial costs would then no longer be allowed. Social Democratic economic policy spokeswoman Magdalena Andersson, a likely new finance minister after the election, said the proposal was "definitely interesting" and added tax planning via interest rate deductions should be stopped. "Then it is important to see how much money will be saved with the new proposal, and then we will get to discuss how the money should be spent," she told Reuters. Politicians across the spectrum liked the idea of making tax planning harder, but questions remained over the proposal's effectiveness, and whether any money saved should be used for lowering corporate taxes. "I think it is excellent to try to close these ways of using creative tax planning," said Per Bolund, economic policy spokesman for the opposition Green Party which could become part of a future centre-left government. "(The current rules) creates inequality among businesses. The large ones with the ability to pay for creative consultants are able to find these ways while the small are not," he told Reuters. Finance Minister Anders Borg said savings should contribute to a lower corporate tax rate, while Bolund of the Greens suggested instead a cut in payroll taxes. Left Party economic policy spokeswoman Ulla Andersson said the money could be put to better use paying for more teachers and assistant nurses. She feared however that some companies, such as private equity-backed firms in the welfare sector, could find ways to beat the system by re-classifying revenues to look like financial incomes, thereby making it easier to maintain deductions for interest. "These companies, which one could say we've been highly critical of, have been very creative when it comes to these issues," she told Reuters. Andersson said one way forward could be to ban certain  transfers between associated companies. Anders Borg, the finance minister, said the proposal was "solid" and that it would simplify the tax code, but he also warned that the companies could find new ways to avoid taxes. "One should never underestimate people's urge not to pay their taxes," he told a news conference after the committee's proposal was published. The government is trailing the opposition by 10 to 15 percentage points in opinion polls. If this were the election outcome, a likely government could consist of the Social Democrats and the Green Party, with support from the Left Party. Magdalena Andersson of the Social Democrats said it was too early to say if closing the loophole should lead to other tax cuts for companies.
