FRANKFURT, June 16 (Reuters) - The size of the European Central Bank's dormant government bond purchase programme stood at 162.7 billion euros as of Friday last week, hardly unchanged from the previous week, the ECB said on Monday.

The remaining size of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) was relevant for the ECB's market operations as it used to withdraw an equivalent amount from the market on a weekly basis to neutralise any threat of them fuelling inflation.  But the ECB decided at its June policy meeting to suspend the weekly fine-tuning operation following the operation  allotted on June 10 - a move aimed at leaving more liquidity in the financial system. The ECB replaced the SMP in September 2012 with an as yet unused bond purchase plan, called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). Because the ECB has said it will keep the bonds it acquired under the SMP until maturity, it will be years before the programme ceases to exist.
