MILAN, June 16 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian bank Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> rose strongly on Monday on the first day of a highly dilutive 800 million euro  share sale and were suspended from trading, while the rights to buy into the cash call failed to start trading.

Shares in bigger rival Banca Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI>, whose 5 billion euros stock sale enters its second week on Monday, rose 3 percent after a brief suspension from trading. Shares in Carige and Monte dei Paschi have risen in the past sessions with purchases driven by a scarcity effect linked to the imbalance between the small number of outstanding shares compared to the huge amount of new stocks to be issued.
