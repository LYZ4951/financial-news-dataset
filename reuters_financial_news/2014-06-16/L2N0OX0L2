June 16 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch unit was fined $8 million and ordered to repay $24.4 million to settle a U.S. regulator's allegations it overcharged thousands of charities and retirement accounts by failing to waive mutual fund sales charges.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-funded regulator, said the restitution was in addition to $64.8 million that Merrill has already repaid harmed investors.
