MOSCOW, June 16 (Reuters) - Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Monday that keeping interest rates at current levels in the coming months may achieve the bank's medium-term inflation goals, implying rates would stay on hold for the foreseeable future.

Nabiullina told a news conference, however, that the risk of inflation exceeding 6 percent this year was high.
