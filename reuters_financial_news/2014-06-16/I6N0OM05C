MILAN, June 16 (Reuters) - Investment bank Mediobanca <MDBI.MI>, one of four key owners of Telecom Italia  <TLIT.MI>, said on Monday it had decided to quit ahead of time a seven-year shareholder agreement to control the Italian phone company.

In a statement, Mediobanca said it had exercised its right to request the demerger of the Telco shareholders agreement, leaving it with a direct stake in Telecom Italia of 1.6 percent. Mediobanca formed the Telco group in 2007 with Spanish telecom operator Telefonica <TEF.MC> and Italian financial institutions Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and Generali <GASI.MI> to fend off a takeover bid by AT&T and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim. Generali has already announced it had decided to exit Telco, which jointly controls 22.4 percent of Telecom Italia.
