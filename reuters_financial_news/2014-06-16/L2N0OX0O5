BUENOS AIRES, June 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Argentina's appeal over its bid to avoid paying $1.33 billion to hedge fund creditors or risk a potential default.

The high court left intact lower court rulings that ordered Argentina to pay. The government had previously warned it could default on its sovereign debt if required to pay in full. [ID:nL2N0OX0FV] Analysts made the following comments:  MARCO LAVAGNA, HEAD ECONOMIST AT ECOLATINA CONSULTANCY "It's a very damaging scenario for Argentina. We will have to wait and see how (judge Thomas) Griesa ends up implementing this. Maybe something could open up there and allow for negotiation without putting at risk the pari passu clause, which expires in December."  GUSTAVO BER, ESTUDIO BER ECONOMIST "The reaction will be generally unfavorable, as this attitude from the Court was not expected. We could have a volatile day today...with bets in reverse as the market was pricing in that (the Court) would at least take up the case."  JOSE LUIS ESPERT, ESTUDIO ESPERT ANALYST "Now the judgement that obliges payment stands. That means (Argentina) obeys and pays or enters into default-default, as it's no longer technical default. Bonds should fall on the news."  SIOBHAN MORDEN, JEFFRIES HEAD OF LATIN AMERICAN STRATEGY "Prices are still adjusting to the reaction, there is a very huge bid/offer on the discount bonds, the market expectation is that prices will fall 30 to 40 percent.  "The reluctance comes from investors waiting to see how Argentina responds - they have to reaffirm their willingness to pay and show ability to do so. "The initial claim is around 1.5 billion but there could be some other tag along liabilities, we have to see what the extent is of these and whether all of them would be willing to negotiate and accept payment in kind. And that is assuming Argentina is willing to negotiate."
