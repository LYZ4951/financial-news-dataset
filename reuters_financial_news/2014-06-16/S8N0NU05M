BUDAPEST, June 16 (Reuters) - Hungary's ruling Fidesz party plans to submit legislation to get rid of foreign currency mortgages by the autumn session of parliament, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, after a court ruling cleared the way for a long-delayed relief package.

"The main principle is that borrowers should get back everything that banks unfairly took from them," Fidesz parliamentary group leader Antal Rogan told a news conference.
