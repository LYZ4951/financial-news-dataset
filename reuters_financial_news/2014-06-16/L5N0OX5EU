LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Monday he would make an announcement about improving bilateral ties with Iran "imminently".

Britain revived diplomatic relations with Iran last November, appointing a non-resident charge d'affairs, two years after an angry mob ransacked the British embassy in Tehran, but has not yet reopened the mission in the Iranian capital.[ID:nL5N0IW28Z] Asked in parliament by opposition Labour party foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander whether the crisis in Iraq showed there was a case for "ensuring an effective diplomatic presence in Tehran", Hague responded that he had spoken to Iran's foreign minister on Saturday "about a number of matters". "He (Alexander) said there is a case for a further step forward in our bilateral relations," Hague said. "I have discussed that with the minister. I will have something more to say about that imminently, in fact very imminently." The United States, a close ally of Britain, has said it could launch air strikes and act jointly with its arch-enemy Iran to shore up the Iraqi government after a rampage by Sunni Islamist insurgents across Iraq that has scrambled alliances in the Middle East.
