June 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The Argentine central bank's move to ease borrowing conditions by setting caps on the interest rates and fees charged by banks on consumer loans should not be a major challenge to the affected banks' ratings, according to Fitch Ratings. The impacted banks maintain good asset quality and capitalization levels with adequate profitability, even after adjusting for the  country's very high inflation. Ratings on Argentina's banks are constrained to  no higher than 'B-' by Argentina's local currency sovereign rating (B-, Negative  Outlook). Though the central bank's action is clearly not friendly to the nation's banking  sector, Fitch does not believe it represents a material challenge to local  banks. The move essentially limits their room to further maneuver, should  additional intervention measures be implemented.  Since 2012, when Argentina's sovereign rating was downgraded, Fitch has factored  potential government interventions into bank rating assessments. That rating  change was driven by increased state tightening of capital controls and the  inability of certain provinces to access U.S. dollars to repay their  dollar-denominated debt under local law. We are also not surprised by the action, as other Latin American central banks  in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia have taken such monetary steps in the past.
