LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc <BARC.L> is to issue about $3.8 billion of new bonds that can convert into shares if the bank hits trouble, after an offer to debt investors to exchange old bonds had much higher than expected take-up.

It is the latest move by Barclays to adjust its capital structure to improve its balance sheet strength to meet new regulations. [ID:nL6N0O167V] Barclays offered to swap old debt instruments for new additional Tier 1 (AT1) securities in three currencies. It issued the results on Friday and said it will issue $1.211 billion of new dollar-denominated AT1 bonds, 697.6 million pounds ($1.17 billion) of sterling instruments, and 1.076 billion euros ($1.46 billion) of euro-denominate AT1 bonds.
