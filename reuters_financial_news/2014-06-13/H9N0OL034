HONG KONG, June 13 (Reuters) - Shanghai shares closed at their highest level in more than 7 weeks on Friday as Chinese banks were buoyed by stronger-than-expected lending data, adding to hopes that the economy is stabilising.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.9 percent at 2,070.71 points, its highest close since April 22. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings jumped 1.1 percent to close at a one-month high. On the week, the CSI300 and the Shanghai benchmark were both up around 2 percent. Bank of China <601988.SS> and Agricultural Bank of China <601288.SS> climbed 1.5 and 1.2 percent to their highest since mid-December. The auto sector also outperformed after Tesla Motors said it would allow others to use its intellectual property in hopes of speeding up development of electric cars by all manufacturers.
