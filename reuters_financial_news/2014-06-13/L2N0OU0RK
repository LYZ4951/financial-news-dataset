NEW YORK/LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Lottery operator GTECH SpA <GTCH.MI> and billionaire Ron Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings are competing to buy International Game Technology <IGT.N>, a Las Vegas-based slot machine maker with a market value of just over $3.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC <APO.N>, a seasoned investor in the U.S. gaming sector and a co-owner of Caesars Entertainment Corp <CZR.O>, is also pursuing a bid, as is buyout firm Carlyle Group LP <CG.O>, the people said on Friday. The parties made preliminary takeover offers for IGT and are preparing to submit binding bids in the next few weeks, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. On Monday, Reuters reported that IGT has hired Morgan Stanley <MS.N> to explore a sale of the company and has received interest from other gaming companies as well as private equity firms.
