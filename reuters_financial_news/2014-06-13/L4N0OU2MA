MUMBAI, June 13 (Reuters) - Indian shares slumped nearly 1.5 percent on Friday, posting their biggest single-day fall in nearly 4-1/2 months as blue-chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> fell on risk aversion after crude oil scaled nine-month highs on rising violence in Iraq.

Investors said higher crude oil prices, if sustained, would increase India's subsidy bill and trade deficit, while falls also tracked dampened global equity markets.

[ID:nL4N0OT22A] Investors are now waiting for India's wholesale inflation data for May due on Monday and the U.S. Federal Reserve decision on further tapering its bond buyback-led stimulus and indications on interest rates on Wednesday. "Oil is on boil but for the short term. It may lead to some correction but the market would bounce back," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.

[ID:nL4N0OT3N4] Bharti Airtel <BRTI.NS> fell 2.5 percent, adding to Thursday's 3.8 percent slump, after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to "underperform" from "neutral," citing competition from rival Rel Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries <RELI.NS>.
