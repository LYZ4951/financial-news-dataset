MILAN, June 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> turned positive after a weak start on Friday as traders snapped up the stock ahead of a highly dilutive 800 million euro ($1 bln) capital increase due to start on Monday.

Shares in the Italian bank opened down 3 percent after Carige said it would price new shares at 0.10 euros each, a 40 percent discount to the theoretical stock price when excluding subscription rights, offering 93 new shares for every 25 already owned.  By 0740 GMT shares in Carige had risen 2 percent, outperforming a 0.7 percent fall in Milan's banking index <.FTIT8300>.
