June 13 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service assigned a MIG 1 rating to the City of Los Angeles' 2014 Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRAN) in the amount of $1.38 billion.

Moody's says the rating on the notes shows the reasonable budget assumptions underlying the city's cash flow projections, its projected year-end cash position and the minimum, one-month cushion between the city's pledged final set-aside and the note maturity.
