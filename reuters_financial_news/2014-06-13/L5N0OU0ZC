BUDAPEST, June 13 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban confirmed on Friday his ruling centre-right Fidesz party's long-term commitment to extra taxes on the financial, retail, telecommunications and energy sectors, a bone of contention with international partners.

The taxes have helped the country to keep its budget deficit below the European Union's mandatory limit of 3 percent of economic output, but sapped profitability at some of the most important sectors of the economy.
