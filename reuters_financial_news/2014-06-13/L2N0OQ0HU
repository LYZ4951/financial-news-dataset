NEW YORK, June 13(Reuters) - Asset growth at the largest U.S. brokerage firms accelerated in 2013 and the firms are positioned for further growth, according to research firm Aite Group.

The four largest brokerage firms, known as the wirehouse firms -- Morgan Stanley <MS.n>, Bank of America's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch unit, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS AG's <UBSN.VX>  U.S. Wealth Management Americas -- managed a total of $6.2 trillion in client assets at the end of 2013, a 12.7 percent increase from 2012. Between 2011 and 2012, these firms grew assets at an 8.2 percent pace.  In the years since the 2008-2009 credit crisis, these firms have grown more slowly than independent advisers and discount brokerage firms, Aite has reported. But the big traditional brokerages are going to do well going forward because they are catering only to clients with more than $1 million in assets and are retaining their most profitable advisers while letting lower performers go, Aite Group research director Alois Pirker said. The firms cut 1,477 advisers in 2013, leaving them with 54,189 advisers at year-end, according to the study, which will not be published until later this month. The wirehouses "are generating more revenue as a result of becoming efficient and lean," Pirker said. "They're different firms than they were five years ago." Industry executives will discuss their path forward at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit taking place next week in New York, Geneva and Singapore. Early indications are that they are feeling good about the future. "We are seeing significantly lower attrition and financial adviser moves," James Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, said at a company conference on Wednesday. "Those four firms can only hire so many people from each other so many times before they stop doing that and we are at that threshold point now, which I think is very exciting for industry stability." Other areas of the wealth management industry also posted solid growth in 2013, a year when the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index returned 30 percent to investors. Independent registered investment advisers (RIAs) saw their assets grow at nearly double the pace of assets at wirehouse brokerage firms in 2013, and the RIA space added 829 advisers, Aite said. Independent RIAs had $2.6 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2013, up 23 percent from the previous year.  Discount and online brokerage firms, which often deal with independent advisers, saw a rise in assets under management of 18 percent to $3.4 trillion, Aite said.
