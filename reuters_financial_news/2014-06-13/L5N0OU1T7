HELSINKI, June 13 (Reuters) - Nordea Bank's <NDA.ST> staff in Finland on Friday walked out and closed most of its offices in the country in a move to protest job cuts, its labour union said.

It said the Finnish bank was planning to cut more than the 250-300 jobs it had announced as its target in April. Only a handful of its less than 300 branches in the country were open, the bank said, adding that its internet bank and cards functioned normally. Spokeswoman for the bank said it was not fully known how many of the 7,700 Finnish staff took part in the protest. She declined not comment on the job cuts, which are part of the group's plan to save 900 million euros through 2015. [ID:nL5N0L30CW]
