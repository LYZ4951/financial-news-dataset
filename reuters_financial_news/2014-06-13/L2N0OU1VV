SAO PAULO, June 13 (Reuters) - Units of Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA> are valued between 10.63 reais and 11.69 reais, a report by investment banking firm NM Rothschild & Sons showed, below the price that the lender's parent company proposed for a planned buyout less than two months ago.

The mid-point value of the units was estimated by a team of Rothschild bankers at 11.16 reais, the report showed. That is about 37 percent less than Spain's Banco Santander SA's <SAN.MC> buyout proposal of 15.31 reais per share made on April 29. The report was elaborated at Banco Santander's behest. Santander launched a $6.5 billion offer for the 25 percent of its Brazilian unit it does not already own. Under terms of the proposed deal, minority investors in Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA> would receive up to 665 million shares of the Madrid-based lender in a voluntary swap.
