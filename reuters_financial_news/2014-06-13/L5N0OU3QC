LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Europe's top share index dropped to a one-week low on Friday, with the conflict in Iraq hitting travel stocks over fears of oil rising higher and the prospect of an early rate hike in Britain hurting property shares.

British property firms fell after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said interest rates could rise sooner than markets expected and it would consider tackling housing market risks. British Land <BLND.L> and Land Securities <LAND.L> fell 4 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. [ID:nL5N0OT5F0] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.2 percent at 1,389.15 points by 1433 GMT, moving further away from this week's 6-1/2-year high, after falling to a low of 1,381.86, the lowest since early June. Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> was down 0.9 percent. "Renewed geopolitical tensions and concerns that interest rate hikes is the UK might come quicker-than-expected are putting some pressure on the market," Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC, said. "However, we believe that the bull case for the market is intact and I don't see today's weakness as the start of a deeper correction. Improving global economic conditions will continue to support the market going forward."  Travel and leisure stocks led the market lower, with the European sector index <.SXTP> falling 1.8 percent after growing tensions in Iraq hit sentiment and boosted oil prices. U.S. President Barack Obama threatened military strikes in Iraq against Sunni Islamist militants who have surged from the north to menace Baghdad and want to establish their own state in Iraq and Syria. [ID:nL5N0OT2BE]  British Airways owner International Airlines Group <ICAG.L>, Germany's Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> and budget airline firm easyJet <EZJ.L>, down 2.7 to 3.7 percent, were among the top decliners on the FTSEurofirst 300 index. "The market was looking for an excuse to take profits after a rally to new highs and tensions in Iraq gave investors an opportunity to trim their positions," Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. "America may send a few fighter planes to help Iraq, but it doesn't look like the start of a new Iraq war. I don't see a sharp pull-back in the market. Shares could fall another 3 to 5 percent in the near term before bouncing back."   Analysts advised caution, which was also reflected in a rally in European volatility index <.V2TX>, investors' main fear gauge and a measure to insure against future swings in shares. The index rose more than 9 percent after falling to a low not seen since December 2006 this week. "I'd rather be short (of European stocks) at the moment," Hobart Capital Markets broker Justin Haque said. "The market has lived in a blissful state but we're not short of warning signs: there's a war in Iraq and Carney wants to raise rates."
