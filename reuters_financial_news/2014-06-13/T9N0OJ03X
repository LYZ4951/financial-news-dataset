TOKYO, June 13 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Friday and revised up its assessment on overseas economies, signalling confidence that the country can meet its price target without additional stimulus.

As expected, the central bank voted unanimously to maintain its pledge of increasing base money, its key policy gauge, at an annual pace of 60-70 trillion yen ($590-$688 billion). BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference from 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT).
