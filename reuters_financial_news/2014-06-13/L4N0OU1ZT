BANGKOK, June 13 (Reuters) - Thai shares edged higher on Friday as hopes around government infrastructure spending lifted construction shares such as Italian-Thai Development Pcl <ITD.BK>, while energy and plantation stocks outperformed across the region amid strong oil prices.

A transport strategy committee planned to propose a 3 trillion baht ($92.71 billion) infrastructure development plan to the ruling military council, news reports said. But army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha said the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) had not discussed the spending plan. [ID:nL4N0OU16S] Italian Thai shares rose 2.8 percent, the second biggest percentage gainer on the top 100 large-cap index <.SET100>. Sino Thai Engineering Pcl <STEC.BK> gained 2.2 percent, while Ch Karnchang <CK.BK> edged 0.5 percent higher. The broader SET index <.SETI> was up 0.2 percent and poised for a modest 0.1 percent gain on the week, a third consecutive week amid optimism around the military government's policy on reviving consumption and investment. Technically, the market was set for a near-term correction, strategists said. Broker Maybank Kim Eng Securities expects the SET fall to 1,455, then 1,450. "Foreign and local investors will likely slow investment due to a lack of new support. Investors are waiting for clarity on NCPO economic, water management, infrastructure project and energy plans, which should take around 1-2 more weeks," it said. Others markets in Southeast Asia were mostly range-bound as Asian stocks slid amid an escalating civil war in Iraq. [MKTS/GLOB] Brent crude, which climbed to a nine-month high, bolstered buying into resources-related stocks such as Tenaga Nasional <TENA.KL>, Astra Agro Lesta <AALI.JK> and Energy Development <EDC.PS> and Keppel Corp <KPLM.SI>. [O/R] In Hanoi, gains in some blue-chips sent Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> 0.4 percent higher. It was on track for a weekly gain of 3 percent, Southeast Asia's best performer.
