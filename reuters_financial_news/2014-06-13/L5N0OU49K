MILAN, June 13 (Reuters) - Italian stock market watchdog Consob said on Friday it would monitor fluctuations in the share price of mid-sized bank Carige <CRGI.MI> during its upcoming share sale, which was priced at a big discount.

Carige's rights issue is highly dilutive, and traders have said they could not rule out a repeat of the market disruption that has been affecting shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> at the start of its own cash call this week. The share sale starts on Monday.
