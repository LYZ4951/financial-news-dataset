June 13 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's said Emirates' [EMIRA.UL] cancellation of an order for 70 A350 planes from Airbus Group NV <AIR.PA> was "credit negative" for the European planemaker and engine supplier Rolls-Royce Plc [RROYC.UL].

The $16 billion dollar cancellation by the Dubai-based airline is a "credit positive" development for Airbus rival Boeing Co <BA.N>, the ratings agency said. Moody's said the decision suggested more clearly the preference of at least one leading airline operating in the rapidly growing Middle East market for the Boeing 777X over the competing A350 XWB offering from Airbus. The surprise decision by Emirates to cancel all of the A350s it had on order comes just months before the long-haul jet is due to enter service.  The move removed 9 percent of the order backlog for a plane which took eight years and $15 billion to develop.
