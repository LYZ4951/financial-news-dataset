BEIJING, June 13 (Reuters) - China's May retail sales logged their best performance since December, growing a better-than-expected 12.5 percent from a year earlier and stirring hopes that the world's second-largest economy may be stabilising.

Industrial output growth was in line with forecasts at 8.8 percent, up marginally from April. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ KEY POINTS IP +8.8 pct y/y (f'cast +8.8 pct, prev month +8.7 pct) Retail sales +12.5 pct y/y (f'cast +12.1 pct, prev month +11.9 pct) Jan-May FAI +17.2 pct y/y (f'cast +17.1 pct, prev period +17.3 pct) Jan-May property investment +14.7 pct y/y (vs Jan-Apr 16.4)  COMMENTARY STEPHEN GREEN, ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, HONG KONG: "The numbers were mostly as expected, just a little bit weaker. There has been a clear easing in monetary policy and we think they have to do much more in terms of RRR (reserve requirement ratio) cuts. "We think the economy will grow by around 7.5 percent this year."  WEI YAO, ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, HONG KONG: "There are signs of a stabilisation in growth, but there are still a couple of aspects that are worrying. "For example, the housing data continued a downward trend and growth in housing investment continued to deteriorate. "I think the data basically justified why the PBOC and the central government in general delivered more (policy) easing measures, despite the better PMI data. "The downward pressure on the economy from the housing sector is still there. So I am not completely assured about a stabilisation in growth right now."  TANG JIANWEI, ECONOMIST, BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS, SHANGHAI: "The slowing investment growth was mainly caused by the poor performance in property investment. Thanks to government efforts to quicken construction of infrastructure projects, it helped to hold up total investment. We can say the biggest uncertainty in the economy this year is the property sector. "Both retail sales and industrial output figures showed some signs of improvement. Still, it's too early to say that the economy is stabilising." "With recent pro-growth measures gaining traction in coming months, we expect the economy will gradually stabilise."  CHESTER LIAW, ECONOMIST, FORECAST PTE, SINGAPORE "The higher retail sales might be somewhat of a pleasant surprise given that imports were actually lower than expected, and might indicate a slight shift towards domestic consumption.  "However, it must be noted that retail sales have stayed far below the official target of 14.5 percent, and unless growth numbers spike significantly in the months ahead, we do not expect the target to be reached."
