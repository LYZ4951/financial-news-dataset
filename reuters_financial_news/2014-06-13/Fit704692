June 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Money market fund outflows from Credit Suisse  were only moderate in May following its guilty plea to helping US clients evade  tax, Fitch Ratings says.  Money fund flows are driven by various factors, including pricing, and can react  to headline risk either by reducing exposures or by shortening maturities. Banks  do not rely on these short-term funds and in most instances place deposits from  the money funds with the Federal Reserve. US prime money fund allocations to Credit Suisse fell 8% in May compared to  relatively stable total prime fund assets, according to data from Crane. The  monthly decline is higher than the average monthly variance of 4.8% for Credit  Suisse's money fund exposures over the previous six months. But the exposures  are still slightly above the end-2013 level, so the overall fall is not  material. The bank was still one of the top 15 held names, comprising $39bn, or  2.6% of money fund assets.  There were stark contrasts at the fund manager level with some counterparties  reducing allocations and others raising exposures to Credit Suisse. The largest  decrease for a fund manager was approximately USD1bn, or 23% of the fund  manager's exposure to the bank. Further downward or upward adjustments are  possible as the settlement is digested, but the impact on overall money fund  allocations is likely to be limited. As we have said previously, we do not  believe the fine and guilty plea from Credit Suisse's settlement on May 19 will  cause significant damage to its franchise. Money fund exposures to BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, which is involved in an ongoing  investigation on US sanctions breaches, increased slightly in May to 2.7% of  assets, up 0.1pp from end-April. Allocations to the bank were USD1bn or 2.8%  higher than April, even though total money fund assets were broadly flat. There  was, however, a wide range of allocation changes among the fund manager mix,  like at Credit Suisse.
