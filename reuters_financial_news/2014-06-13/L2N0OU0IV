WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Treasury official on Friday rejected proposals to recapitalize Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB>, saying it would take at least 20 years to make sure they were adequately funded and that in the meantime taxpayers would potentially be on the hook.

In remarks prepared for delivery to a housing conference, Treasury Under Secretary Mary Miller repeated the Obama administration's call for winding down the two government-controlled mortgage finance firms.
