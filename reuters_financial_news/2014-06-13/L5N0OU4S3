SANTIAGO, June 13 (Reuters) - Chilean bank CorpBanca <COB.SN> said on Friday that a lawsuit brought by U.S. investment firm Cartica Management to stop a proposed merger with a Brazilian bank was "entirely without merit."

Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA> is seeking to win control of CorpBanca in what would be Latin America's largest banking merger since 2008.  Cartica's lawsuit, a rare instance of investor activism in the region, alleges that Itau, CorpBanca and billionaire Alvaro Saieh, CorpBanca's controlling shareholder, violated U.S. anti-fraud and disclosure rules. Cartica, which owns around 3.2 percent of CorpBanca's common shares, added Itau as a defendant in its lawsuit on Thursday. [ID:nL2N0OT0OH] "CorpBanca continues to firmly believe that Cartica's claims are entirely without merit, and that Cartica's interests are not aligned with those of other CorpBanca shareholders," said the Chilean bank in a statement. In response to Cartica's claim that Saieh, Itau and CorpBanca were "continuing to withhold material information" CorpBanca said: "CorpBanca has supplied an abundance of disclosures about the proposed merger throughout the process...CorpBanca's shareholders have all material information they need to cast a fully informed vote." Control of CorpBanca would give Itau a foothold in retail banking in Chile, and provide a way to expand in Colombia, South America's fastest-growing economy last year. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York.
