LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Shares in CGG <GEPH.PA>, a company whose services include providing geological data analysis to energy companies, rose on Friday as traders cited rumours it could attract bid interest.

CGG shares were up by 9 percent, with trading volumes in the stock coming in at 2.5 times its 3-month daily average. A Paris-based trader said there was speculation that U.S. peer Baker Hughes <BHI.N> could bid for CGG, while adding that CGG's shares were also being boosted by expectations that it could win a big contract in India. CGG declined to comment on the situation.
