SEOUL, June 13 (Reuters) - South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), world's fourth largest pension fund, will newly invest about 38 trillion won ($37.34 billion) in 2015, a government ministry said on Friday.

The Ministry of Health & Welfare said in a statement that NPS will invest 24 trillion won in local stocks and bonds, 10 trillion won in foreign stocks and bonds, and 4 trillion won in alternative investments in 2015.  The pension fund's total investments in 2015 are expected to show a 5.6 percent increase from a planned 36 trillion won in investments this year.  The ministry added that in 2013, NPS's foreign stock holdings yielded a return of 21.6 percent. In May, the government said NPS aims to boost stocks in its portfolio by some 5 percentage points by the end of 2019 while cutting holdings of bonds.

It had 436 trillion won in assets as of end-March.   NPS has also recently hired a U.S.-based advisor to invest $400 million in Asian real estate to increase its exposure to property in its home region. [ID:nL4N0OS0P1]
