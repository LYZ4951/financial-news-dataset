June 12 (Reuters) - John Malone's Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O> and Discovery Communications Inc <DISCA.O> are in discussions with the owners of Formula One to bridge a $1 billion gap in the valuation of the motor-racing series as they seek to buy a 49 percent stake, according to Bloomberg.

CVC Capital Partners, a London-based private equity firm, and Lehman Brothers Holdings [LEHMB.UL] want about $500 million more for the stake, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. (http://link.reuters.com/sew99v) Discussions with CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Lehman Brothers are ongoing although a deal may not be reached, the report added. CVC remains the largest shareholder in Formula One with a stake of around 35 percent. [ID:nL5N0KQ1HZ] CVC may also contemplate an initial public offering of Formula One, according to Bloomberg, although the sources added that it is unlikely to occur before the conclusion of a trial involving Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone. Discovery Communications and Liberty Global were not immediately available for comment. CVC Capital Partners and Lehman Brothers were also unavailable for comment.
