HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, June 13 (Reuters) - Canada's Talisman Energy Inc <TLM.TO> is reviewing its Asian oil and gas portfolio, valued at about $4 billion, which could lead to a partial or full sale, people familiar with the matter said.

Talisman, Canada's No. 5 independent oil producer, has been slimming its operations and cutting debt in an effort to boost its share price to satisfy disgruntled and activist investors such as Carl Icahn. The company, which has a $10.8 billion market value, is working with Goldman Sachs <GS.N> on the review, the people added.
