June 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that it expects the German non-life sector to report a strong increase in its net underwriting result for 2014, on the back of further premium rate increases in the wake of natural catastrophes and related claim experience a year ago.  In particular Fitch expects the improvement to be driven by continued premium  increases in the motor line, which Fitch expects to report a net combined ratio  below 100% in 2014 for the first time in seven years.  The favourable trend in premiums will offset continued muted investment yield  resulting from a low interest rate environment. Investment returns for the  German non-life sector are forecast by Fitch to fall to 3.4% in 2014 from 3.8%  in 2013. The report, 'German Non-Life Insurance Dashboard: 2014', highlights recent  market trends, including weakened underwriting results in 2013 due to the high  natural catastrophe activity in Germany that year.
