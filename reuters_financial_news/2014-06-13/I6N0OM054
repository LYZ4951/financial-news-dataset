MILAN, June 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> fell in early trade on Friday, after the Italian mid-sized lender said it would sell new shares at a large discount in an imminent 800 million euro ($1.1 billion) cash call needed to bolster its weak capital base.

Carige said on Thursday it would price new shares at 0.10 euros each, a 40 percent discount to the theoretical stock price when excluding subscription rights, offering 93 new shares for every 25 already owned. [ID:nI6N0OM04Z]
