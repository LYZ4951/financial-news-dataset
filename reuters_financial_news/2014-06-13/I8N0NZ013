MUMBAI, June 13 (Reuters) - India's NSE index slumped nearly 1.5 percent on Friday, posting its biggest single-day fall in nearly 4-1/2 months as blue-chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> fell on risk aversion after crude oil scaled nine-month highs on escalating violence in Iraq.

ICICI Bank provisionally fell 2.4 percent, while Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> ended 2.7 percent down.
