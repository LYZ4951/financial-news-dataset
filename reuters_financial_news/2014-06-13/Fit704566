June 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published the National Long-Term Rating on CTBC Bank Co., Ltd.'s [CTRUSC.UL] (CTBC Bank) upcoming TWD15bn subordinated bonds at 'AA-(twn)', on Rating Watch Negative (RWN).   The company's subordinated bonds will be issued in two tranches: 15-year  TWD13.5bn and 10-year TWD1.5bn. They carry a fixed coupon rate of 2% and a  floating coupon rate respectively, with maturities on 26 June 2029 and 26 June  2024. The proceeds, which qualify as Taiwanese Basel III Tier 2 capital, will be  used to refinance maturing debts and enhance the bank's capitalization.   KEY RATING DRIVER - Debt Rating Fitch rates the bonds two notches down from CTBC Bank's anchor rating, its  Viability Rating (VR) of 'a' that is equivalent to 'AA+(twn)' on the National  Rating scale. The notching reflects poor recovery prospects at the point of  non-viability or government receivership and absence of terms for coupon  omission and deferral. Fitch views the recovery prospects for the bonds are poor  as Taiwan's authorities would only move a bank into insolvency administration  when it reaches a very low capital level or a 2% capital adequacy ratio. The  notching is in accordance with Fitch's criteria on rating bank subordinated and  hybrid securities.  The bank's VR is currently on RWN because the acquisition of The Tokyo Star  Bank, Ltd. [TKOST.UL] by CTBC Bank will probably weaken the bank's core capitalisation and  consolidated earnings quality. Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch when there is  greater clarity on CTBC Bank's consolidated financials, likely in August 2014.  Tokyo Star Bank follows Basel II standards for its capital requirements and  Japanese GAAP for its financial reporting, while CTBC Bank uses Basel III  standards and IFRS.
