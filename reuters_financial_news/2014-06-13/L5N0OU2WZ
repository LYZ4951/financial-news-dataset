WARSAW, June 13 (Reuters) - Poland's M3 money supply <PLM3MS=ECI> rose 5.3 percent year-on-year in May, slightly below expectations, central bank data showed on Friday.

Analysts in a Reuters poll expected the M3 figure -- a broad measure of cash in circulation, money market funds and bank deposits with a term of up to two years -- to be up 5.5 percent year-on-year last month.
