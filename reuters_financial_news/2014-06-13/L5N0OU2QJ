PORT LOUIS, June 13 (Reuters) - Mauritius' current account deficit narrowed in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the same period last year on the back of a lower shortfall in the merchandise trade account, official figures from the central bank showed on Friday.

The deficit fell to 5.37 billion rupees ($180 million) from 7.30 billion rupees. In the full year 2013, the current account deficit was 36.18 billion rupees. "The contraction in the deficit is largely attributed to an improvement in the merchandise trade deficit, which came down from 15.63 billion to 12.65 billion in the quarter under review," the Bank of Mauritius said in a statement. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed 19 percent quarter on quarter to 12.65 billion rupees due to an increase of 5 percent in exports while imports fell 5.5 percent.  The Bank of Mauritius also said on Friday foreign direct investment in the Indian Ocean island, which markets itself as a bridge between Africa and Asia, fell to 1.8 billion rupees in the first three months of 2014 from 2.6 billion rupees a year earlier.  First quarter investment was mainly directed towards the real estate sector, attracting 1.5 billion rupees, followed by accommodation and food service activities, which got 117 million.
