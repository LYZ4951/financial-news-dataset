June 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that the planned IPO of Braas Monier  Building Group SA <BMSA.TG> (Braas Monier) is credit positive. However, the improvement  isnot sufficient to have an impact on its ratings. Fitch rates Braas Monier's  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B' with a Stable Outlook. The group's financial profile and liquidity will benefit from a EUR100m primary  offering, of which around EUR40m will be used to repay drawings under its  existing revolving credit facility (RCF). The remainder will be held as cash on  closing and strengthen the group's liquidity.  Following successful closing of the IPO, Fitch forecasts funds from operations  (FFO) adjusted leverage to reduce to well below 5.0x by end-2014. Fitch  previously said that failure to improve FFO adjusted leverage to below 5.0x  could result in negative rating pressure (see "Fitch Rates Braas Monier's Senior  Secured Notes and Term Loan Final 'B+", dated 2 May 2014). Proceeds from a concurrent secondary offering will not affect the group's  financial profile. Net proceeds to the existing shareholders of around EUR400m  to EUR500m will remain entirely outside of the RCF and senior secured notes  restricted group.  We do not expect the transaction to trigger any mandatory pre-payment mechanisms  in the group's existing debt documentation. Braas Monier's net leverage is lower  than the 3.25x mandatory prepayment threshold specified in its existing bank  agreements. In addition, no change of control will be triggered, as the current  owners will maintain control of the group.
