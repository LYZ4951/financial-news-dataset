June 13 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bright Food Group Co., Ltd.'s [SHMNGA.UL] (Bright Food) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB-'. The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed Bright Food's foreign-currency senior unsecured rating and the rating on its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary Bright Food Hong Kong Limited (Bright Food HK) at 'BBB-'. The affirmation reflects a 'BB' standalone rating of Bright Food with a  two-notch uplift to 'BBB-' from Shanghai government support. The company's  financial leverage remains high, mainly due to 2H13 spending in property  business and the Tnuva acquisition in 2014. However, the business profile has  been enhanced. With the stronger tangible support from Shanghai's State-owned  Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), witnessed in  continuous assets injection and restructuring, Bright Food now has better access  to equity financing and maybe able to deleverage faster than before.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Support from Government: Bright Food's ratings benefit from a two-notch uplift  from its strong linkage with Shanghai SASAC, which fully supports Bright Food's  role in securing food security of Shanghai residents. Strong tangible support  from the government is demonstrated in the recent asset injection of Shanghai  Vegetables Group, which satisfies the majority of the daily vegetables demand in  Shanghai, and is an important platform for the Shanghai government to stabilise  and regulate the supply and price of the basic food market.  Government support  also includes the capital injection from Shanghai SASAC and the annually  increasing government subsidies. Acquisitive Strategy Pressures Leverage: Leverage, measured by FFO adjusted net  leverage ratio, has increased sharply in recent years to 5.7x in 2012 and 5.8x  in 2013, up from under 2.0x before 2010, a result of a series of transactions  including acquiring Manassen Food in 2011, Weetabix in 2012, and large  investments in property market in 2013. Fitch expects the leverage could be even  higher in 2014 as the debt-funded Tnuva acquisition is expected to be completed  in November.  Although the Tnuva acquisition drives up Bright Food's financial leverage, the  company's business risk profile meanwhile has been enhanced by synergies from  product innovation, herding technology, cost saving and overseas resources.  Fitch also expects debt reduction in 2015 through the disposal of Bright Food's  substantial financial and non-core assets as well as potential equity offering. Non-property business improved: Bright Food invested aggressively in 2013 to  beef up its real estate arm. The aggressive land acquisitions in 2H13  temporarily pushed up working capital requirement and its financial leverage.  However, the underlying financial profile of Bright Food's non-property business  in 2013 improved with higher EBITDA margin and lower leverage. Fitch expects  near-term cash inflow from property sales, supported by the large land inventory  and the Shanghai Haibo restructuring. The property sector spending in 2013  should be short-term drag on the group's financial leverage, rather a cash drain  in the next couple of years. Operating in defensive industries: Bright Food generates most of its revenue and  EBITDA from food-related businesses, that account for 85% of revenue and 73% of  EBITDA in 2013 and have witnessed stable growth since 2005. The taxi and  logistics businesses also have a stable earnings record, particularly a result  of continuous government grants to offset the rising fuel costs. Five of the  nine core segments generate a significant portion of its revenue and EBITDA from  Shanghai, one of the largest and most economically advanced municipalities in  China. Bright Food is also among the top three domestic players with an  established nationwide presence in industries such as diary and sugar, Regional business concentration: Bright Food's entrenched presence in Shanghai  and eastern China allows it to enjoy synergies from its diversified operations  within these markets. However, the lack of an integrated nationwide presence  limits the benefits the company can derive from new products it has acquired  through recent overseas investments. Leakages to Minority Shareholders: Minorities interest of Bright Food is around  half of the group's consolidated share equity. Profits attributable to minority  shareholders amounted to about 50% of the group's consolidated net profit in the  past five years. Removing the minority interests, the scale of the group is  materially smaller. However, since a significant portion of debt is held under  its subsidiaries with large minority interests, the debt burden of the group is  therefore substantially shared by its minority shareholders accordingly.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action  include: - improved operational integration of most of its business segments resulting in  material margin expansion or - FFO adjusted net leverage sustains below 3.0x Factors that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action  include: -further acquisition or failure/material delay of debt reduction plan leading to  leverage rising above 4.5x
