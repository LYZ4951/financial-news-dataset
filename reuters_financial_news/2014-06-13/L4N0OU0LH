SHANGHAI, June 13 (Reuters) - China's money rates fell again this week after the central bank signalled an accommodative liquidity stance by injecting funds into the markets for the fifth straight week, in line with Beijing's efforts to boost the economy, traders said.

But falls in short-term funding costs have slowed from recent weeks amid increasing signs the government's efforts to support the economy have focused on targeted areas rather than  broader monetary policy, they said. Sweeping monetary policy easing measures had been expected by some economists. The weighted average of the seven-day bond repurchase agreement rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.04 percent at midday on Friday, down 12 basis points from last week's close. Another active tenor, the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, dropped 21 basis points to 3.23 percent. Before a slowdown in the pace of declines from last week, the seven-day repo rate plunged 83 basis points last month while the 14-day rate tumbled 86 basis points amid increasing signs that Beijing was taking steps to curb slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. This week, the People's Bank of China announced it would cut the level of reserves banks must hold for those that have sizeable loans to the farming sector and small- and medium-sized firms.

[ID:nL4N0OS2RU] But it is precisely such targeted stimulus that makes dealers believe China won't change its neutral monetary policy of the past several years unless the economy slows further.  LIQUIDITY TRAP The seven-day repo rate, for instance, has failed to breach key support at 3 percent. It is now hovering at levels post the global financial crisis, but far higher than during the crisis. "It's clear that the government doesn't believe the current economic slowdown is as serious as during the crisis," said a senior dealer at a Chinese state-owned bank in Beijing. "As such, the market doesn't think the government's latest move of targeted easing will develop into a full-fledged monetary easing for now." One of the key barriers that keeps the PBOC from rushing into a monetary easing is that China appears to be facing increasing signs of a liquidity trap, traders said. An article by the central bank's newspaper, the Financial News, said earlier this year that China's economy has shown increasingly muted response to increased liquidity supply after the global financial crisis. Large scale injections such as via a cut in banks' required reserves have seen their impact on the economy lessen over time, the central bank said., That is a typical sign of a liquidity trap in which the boost from monetary easing to the economy is diluted gradually after excessive exposure. Still, as a milder step, the PBOC is offering more cash to the money markets as part of Beijing's efforts for targeted easing. For instance, it injected a net 104 billion yuan into the markets via open market operations this week, up from 73 billion yuan ($12 billion) last week. [CN/MMT] If necessary, the central bank could resume reverse repos which inject short-term liquidity into the markets as a first measure to support growth, before it takes stronger measures such as a reserve ratio cut, traders said.
