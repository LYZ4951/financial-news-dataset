NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday, indicating the S&P 500 will build on its biggest gain in nearly a month, earnings from Bank of America and ahead of data on inflation and manufacturing.

* Bank of America <BAC.N> shares climbed 2 percent to $17.10 before the opening bell after the second-largest U.S. bank  reported an eight-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit, driven by a steep fall in provisions to cover bad loans. [ID:nL3N0KP2ZB]  * The S&P 500 <.SPX> rose 1.1 percent on Tuesday, its biggest climb since Dec. 18, as a strong December retail sales reading eased concerns that economic growth might be slowing and stocks may be expensive.  * Economic data due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) includes Empire State manufacturing survey for January and the producer price index for December. The New York Fed data is expected to show a reading of 3.75 while producer prices are expected to rise 0.4 percent.  * Later in the session at 2:00 p.m. (1900 GMT), the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book of economic conditions.  * Other S&P 500 companies scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday include CSX Corp <CSX.N> and Kinder Morgan Inc <KMI.N>.  * Concerns have crept in among investors recently that stock prices may have become extended. The S&P 500's forward price to earnings ratio is at its highest level in nearly seven years. The benchmark S&P 500 surged about 30 percent in 2013. * S&P 500 futures <SPc1> rose 4.1 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> gained 45 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> added 13.25 points. * General Motors Co <GM.N> gained 2.7 percent to $41.08 in premarket trade after the automaker said it will pay the first quarterly dividend on its common stock in almost six years. [ID:nL2N0KO27P] * Chelsea Therapeutics International Ltd <CHTP.O> surged 154.4 percent to $5.85 in premarket after an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Tuesday a drug to treat a rare form of low blood pressure made by the company is effective enough to warrant regulatory approval. [ID:nL2N0KO251] * European shares rose to fresh 5-1/2 year highs, buoyed by a better global growth outlook from the World Bank, with gains supported by easing regulatory concerns over banks in the euro zone.
