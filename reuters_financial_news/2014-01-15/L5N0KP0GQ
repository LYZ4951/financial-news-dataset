MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has no exchange rate target, and is shifting towards a free float of the rouble to insulate the real economy from volatility on global markets, First Deputy Chairwoman Ksenia Yudayeva said on Wednesday.

"We really don't have an exchange rate target - we are exiting the market," Yudayeva said in a speech to an economic forum in Moscow.
