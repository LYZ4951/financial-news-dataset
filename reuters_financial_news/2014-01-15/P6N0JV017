PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trade on Wednesday, with a key benchmark hitting a 5-1/2 year high, mirroring gains on Wall Street and in Asia on renewed hopes for global growth.

Boosting sentiment, the World Bank raised its forecast for growth for the first time in three years, signalling the world economy is finally pulling out of a long and sluggish recovery that followed the global financial crisis.
