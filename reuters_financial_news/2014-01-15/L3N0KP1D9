JAKARTA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Indonesian sharia lender PT Bank Panin Syariah Tbk <PNBS.JK> rose as much as 5 percent to 105 rupiah in their trading debut in Jakarta on Wednesday.

Panin Syariah, a subsidiary of Bank Panin <PNBN.JK>, sold 4.75 billion new shares, or 48.7 percent of its enlarged capital, to raise 475 billion rupiah ($39.4 million) in its initial public offering, the first on Indonesia's stock exchange this year. [ID:nL4N0JI0C5] Evergreen Capital and RHB OSK Securities were underwriters for the IPO.  Panin Syariah is the first sharia lender to list in Indonesia since the country's second-largest sharia lender, PT Bank Muamalat Indonesia, delayed an IPO worth up to $177 million because of weak market conditions last June. [ID:nL3N0EX0NP] The stock was trading at 100 rupiah at 0301 GMT. Banking shares <.JKFINA> rose 1.15 percent, while the broader Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> was up 0.5 percent.
