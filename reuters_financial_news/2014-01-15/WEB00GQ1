FRANKFURT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer AG <BAYGn.DE> said on Wednesday it was cleared by the French health authority to reintroduce oral acne treatment Diane-35 to the French market after an eight-month suspension.

The European Commission said in July that Diane-35 was safe for use, a seal of approval which obliged France to allow sales of the product again. [ID:nL6N0G0510] France had suspended sales of Diane-35 after four deaths over the past 25 years were linked to its use. [ID:nL5N0AZKO1]
