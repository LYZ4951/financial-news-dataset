HONG KONG, Jan 15 (Reuters) - China shares underperformed most of Asia on Wednesday after weaker-than-expected money supply and loan growth data fanned concerns about tightening liquidity in the mainland, accelerating a shift into small-cap stocks.

The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the biggest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings ended down 0.2 percent, as did the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, which finished at 2,023.3 points.   The ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mainly startups in technology and other nascent industries listed in Shenzhen climbed 1.3 percent to a record high.
