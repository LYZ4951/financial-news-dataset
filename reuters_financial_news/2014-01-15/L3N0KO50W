SEOUL, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Seoul shares moved higher on Wednesday morning after a robust consumer spending report reassured investors the U.S. economy was on a firm footing, but the yen resumed its retreat against the dollar and the won to cap gains.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> was up 0.4 percent at 1,954.65 points as of 0200 GMT. "It's too early to predict whether the improved U.S. consumer spending has actually translated to increase into local exporters' earnings, but it definitely helped risk sentiment," said Chang Hee-jong, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities. Wall Street gained overnight on news retail sales rose 0.7 percent in December to beat expectations of 0.3 percent, a sign the U.S. economy was gathering momentum at the end of last year. But the robust U.S. data put the greenback on the rise, weakening the yen against the won <JPYKRW=R> to put investors on the defensive.   Shares in food & beverages and telecoms were on the rise, with Lotte Confectionery Co Ltd <004990.KS> and SK Telecom Co Ltd <017670.KS> advancing 3.2 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Secondary battery maker Samsung SDI Co Ltd <006400.KS>  gained 2.3 percent, tracking Tesla Motors Inc <TSLA.O> which rose nearly 16 percent after it blew past initial fourth quarter sales forecast by 20 percent. Samsung SDI and Tesla Motors are currently in talks over a battery technology deal.

In declining stocks, SK Hynix Inc <000660.KS> plunged 4.4 percent as investors consolidated gains from recent price rises that followed a fire at factory at its factory in Wuxi, China. It suffered a drop in DRAM memory chip prices after news its fire-affected Wuxi plant was expected to resume production.
