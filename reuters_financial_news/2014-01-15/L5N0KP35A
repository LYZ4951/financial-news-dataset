FRANKFURT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European prompt power exchange EPEX Spot on Wednesday delivered figures for electricity trading in four European countries in 2013, showing volumes grew by 2 percent over 2012 to 339 terawatt-hours (TWh).

The Paris-based bourse hosts spot trading in Germany and Austria jointly, as there are no bottlenecks between them, and in France and Switzerland, a region where power trades are continuously converging. Overall, the EPEX Spot day-ahead market traded 0.5 percent more spot power in the four countries in 2013, at 322.8 TWh. The region accounts for a third of European power demand. Main contracts Germany and Austria kept day-ahead trades roughly steady in 2013 at 245.6 TWh, up just 0.1 percent from 2012. Its partner bourse EEX in Leipzig focuses on European power futures, among gas and carbon contracts. [ID:nL6N0KO18G] The intraday market saw volumes increase sharply to 23.1 TWh, helped by the start of Swiss intraday power trading in June and an extension of 15-minute contracts to that region. EPEX Spot said it added 10 trading members to reach a total of 212. More pooling of prices in Europe will kick off on Feb. 4, when Nordic and Baltic states and Britain add their systems and processes for a wider European price coupling initiative that adds to an existing scheme.
