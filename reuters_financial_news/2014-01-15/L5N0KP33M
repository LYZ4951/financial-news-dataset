MILAN, 15 Jan (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Popolare di Milano <PMII.MI> this week should take the long-expected step of naming Giuseppe Castagna as its chief executive, sources close to the matter said, ending a long power vacuum that has forced it to delay a capital increase.

Its shares were up 5.1 percent to 0.534 euros by 1622 GMT on Wednesday after local newspapers reported, citing sources, that the cooperative lender's supervisory board would make the appointment this week.  "We are in the home stretch, Castagna should be officially appointed on Friday," one of the sources said.  Castagna, a former executive at Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, Italy's largest bank by assets, has been expected to take the helm since soon after former CEO Piero Montani quit the bank in late October after a clash with its supervisory board. [ID:nL5N0IH0HR]  Montani's departure prompted Standard & Poor's and Fitch to cut their debt ratings for the bank last year and also blocked the approval of an updated business plan.
