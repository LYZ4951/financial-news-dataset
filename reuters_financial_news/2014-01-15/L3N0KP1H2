MUMBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Indian government bonds rallied on Wednesday after the central bank deferred a weekly debt sale and as easing retail inflation led to hopes that the central bank would keep interest rates on hold at its policy review later this month.

The benchmark 10-year bond yield <IN088323G=CC> fell 5 basis points to 8.66 percent. Bond markets were closed on Tuesday for a local holiday. The central bank said late on Monday it had deferred an auction worth 150 billion rupees ($2.42 billion) scheduled to be held on Friday after reviewing the government's cash position and funding requirement.
