BANGKOK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Thai stocks retreated on Wednesday as investors locked in quick profits amid anti-government protests in Bangkok and uncertainty over the Feb. 2 poll, while Indonesian shares hit their two-month high with mining companies <.JKMING> leading the pack.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> was down 0.3 percent in moderate trading volume at 0530 GMT after gaining 3.2 percent over the past two sessions, with mobile phone operator Advanced Info Service Pcl <ADVA.BK> falling back after two straight sessions of rises. Brokers expect profit-taking to cap the index from breaking above 1,300, with pressure building on the caretaker government to call off the Feb. 2 election and step down. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra invited protest leaders and political parties to a meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss an Election Commission proposal to postpone the election until May. [ID:nL3N0KP12E][ID:nL3N0KO1K1] A meeting of the National Anti-Corruption Commission on Thursday, where it is set to bring formal charges against those involved in alleged corruption in the controversial rice-pledging scheme, including Yingluck, is also on focus. "There is a possibility that the SET will slump again, if the political tension does not ease in the near term," strategists with brokerage Maybank Kim Eng Securities wrote in a report. Indonesia's index <.JKSE> climbed 1.3 percent to 4,445.47, the highest since Nov. 11. Among outperformers, nickel producer Vale Indonesia <INCO.JK> jumped as much as 7 percent after the government halted mineral ore exports in an attempt to promote processing domestically. [ID:nL3N0KP14L] Foreign inflows sent Indonesian shares higher by more than 3 percent on Monday. The market was closed on Tuesday. <.VMFIN.JK> Jakarta-based Trimegah Securities expects short-covering to further boost the market. "On Monday, foreign investors covered their short positions... We expect further short-covering today, but the market is likely to be more mixed for the remainder of the week," it said in a report. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI>, the Philippines <.PSI> and Vietnam <.VNI> rose in line with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, which was up 0.1 percent after the World Bank upgraded its outlook for the global economy. [MKTS/GLOB] Bright spots in the region included Malaysia's IOI Properties Group <IOIP.KL>, which soared in its market debut, and Indonesian sharia lender PT Bank Panin Syariah <PNBS.JK>, which rose as much as 5 percent in its trading debut.
