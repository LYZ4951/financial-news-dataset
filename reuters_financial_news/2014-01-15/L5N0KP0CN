DUBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Samba Financial Group <1090.SE>, Saudi Arabia's second-largest listed bank by assets, said its fourth-quarter net profit rose 15.8 percent year-on-year, earnings which came in slightly below analyst expectations.

The bank said in a bourse filing on Wednesday it made 1.01 billion riyals ($269.3 million) in the three months to Dec. 31, compared to 869 million riyals in the same period of 2012.  Nine analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast it would, on average, post a net profit for the quarter of 1.08 billion riyals. [ID:nL6N0KG05T]
