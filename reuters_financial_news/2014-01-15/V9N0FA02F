VIENNA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A solution to the problem of foreign-exchange home loans in Hungary that burden households could be found within half a year, a deputy central bank governor said on Thursday.

"A couple of good ideas are forming. I hope that this can be solved in the next six months," Adam Balog told a Euromoney conference in Vienna when asked about the issue. The central bank has said that banks operating in Hungary abused their dominant position in foreign-currency lending and legislation was needed to tackle the problem. [ID:nL6N0K00G7]
