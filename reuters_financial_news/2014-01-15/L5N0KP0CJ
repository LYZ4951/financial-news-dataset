MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest bank Sberbank <SBER.MM> said on Wednesday its full year 2013 net profit under Russian accounting standards rose 13 percent, held back by a spike in bad loan provisions as the economy slowed.

Net profit increased to 392.6 billion roubles ($11.8 billion) compared with 346.2 billion in 2012, the state-controlled lender said in a statement.
