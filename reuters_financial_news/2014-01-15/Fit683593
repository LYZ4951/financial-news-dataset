Jan 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.S.'s <TUPRS.IS> (Tupras) Long-term local and foreign currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BBB-' and its National Long-term rating at 'AA+(tur)'. Tupras's USD700m notes due in 2018 have been affirmed at 'BBB-'. The  Outlooks are Stable.  The Stable Outlook reflects our forecast that in 2015 Tupras's credit metrics  will return to levels commensurate with the 'BBB-' ratings, ie, funds from  operations (FFO) net leverage of below 2.5x on a sustained basis. This is  despite tight refining margins that should persist until at least 2015 and the  adverse impact of the recent sharper-than-expected depreciation of the Turkish  lira. We expect Tupras's credit metrics to have been stretched in 2013 and to  remain so in 2014, ie, FFO adjusted net leverage of between 2.5x and 3x, as it  completes the Residuum Upgrading Project (RUP) at the Izmit refinery, pays  generous dividends and implements high capex until 2015, leaving limited rating  headroom.KEY RATING DRIVERS Turkish Downstream Leader Tupras's ratings are driven by its dominant downstream and marketing position in  Turkey, where the company is presently the only oil refiner. It owns and  operates all four existing oil refineries in Turkey (BBB-/Stable) and has a 59%  share of Turkish oil products (2012 data). With its total refining capacity of  28.1 million metric tons (MT) at end-2012, the company is one of the largest  downstream companies in Europe. In 2013, Tupras produced nearly 22.5MT  of oil  products, a 2.9% increase yoy, which are mainly supplied to the domestic market  (80% of production volumes).  Tupras operates in the domestic fuel distribution market through its 40%-owned  fuel distributor Opet Petrolculuk A.S. Its strong market position supports its  financial profile. We expect that following the commissioning of the RUP in  November 2014, Tupras will improve its EBITDA margins to about 4.5%, or levels  reported in 2007-2011, from the 2.5%-3% forecast for 2013-2014. Refining is the  main profit contributor for Tupras (88% of 2012 operating profit), with the  remainder generated by the fuel distribution segment.  Foreign Exchange Risks until 2015 Tupras's RUP project loans are denominated in US dollars. A continued  depreciation of TRY against the dollar could substantially worsen Tupras's  credit ratios and may lead to a breach of  loan covenants, in particular in  2014, when headroom under the covenants will be lowest. The 23% drop in the  Turkish lira in 2013 to nearly 2.18 TRY for 1 USD highlights this risk. Fitch's  updated sovereign forecast for TRY is 2.2 TRY for 1 USD in 2014 on average and  2.1 TRY for 1 USD in 2015 on average. We believe that Tupras's currency risk  should diminish when the RUP becomes operational in 2015, ie, it starts  generating US dollar-linked revenues and EBITDA.   Turkish Market Offers Growth Potential Fitch sovereign analysts forecast Turkey's real GDP growth of 3.2% in 2014 and  3.8% in 2015, which we believe should translate into higher demand for oil  products due to increasing domestic vehicle fleet and air travel.Debt-Funded Capex In 2008 Tupras began implementing the RUP to increase Izmit refinery's capacity  to produce 3.5MT of light and medium products that are compliant with Euro 5  standards. At end-3Q13, Tupras had spent USD2bn out of estimated USD2.7bn on the  RUP, which was mainly funded by debt, and reported 85% overall project  completion for the RUP. After the project completion, expected to be in November  2014, the Izmit refinery will increase the Nelson Complexity Index (a measure of  refineries' technological sophistication) to 14.5 from 7.78 currently (based on  design capacity). Tupras expects that the RUP will generate an additional  USD550m per year in EBITDA at oil prices of USD85/bbl due to an improved product  mix. We estimate Tupras's total capex in 2013-2016 at over TRY5.3bn, most of  which is debt-funded.  Profit Margins and Working Capital Volatility Tupras's refining margins have been under considerable pressure in 2012-2013,  declining to about USD2.6/bbl in 9M13, from USD5.3/bbl in 2011. To mitigate the  impact of declining margins, Tupras has extensively used vendor financing by  agreeing more favourable payment terms with suppliers, in particular Iran, and  utilising accounts receivable factoring on a non-recourse basis with the  factoring companies of Turkish banks, thus decreasing its overall working  capital needs. In our rating case, we expect that Tupras's refining margins will  remain under pressure until at least 2015 when the RUP becomes fully  operational. We also expect Tupras to continue optimising its working capital  but until it can demonstrate consistent operational profitability, the ratings  would see little upside.   Replacing Iranian Oil is no Longer a Priority In November 2013, the US State Department extended six-month Iran sanctions  waivers to Turkey, among other countries, in exchange for their reduced  purchases of Iranian crude oil earlier this year. Under the Geneva accord signed  that month, the U.S. and five other countries agreed to suspend efforts to  further reduce Iran's crude oil sales, allowing consuming countries to continue  buying their 'current average amounts of crude oil'. In 9M13, Iraq became  Tupras's principal crude oil source by supplying nearly 28% of its crude oil,  while Iran supplied 25% of Tupras's total crude, down from 45% in 2011. Tupras's  favourable location and coastal refineries give it access to a variety of crude  sources.   Impact of Receivables Factoring Tupras's trade receivables subject to factoring were TRY1.7bn at end-3Q13, up  from TRY1.5bn at end-2012. If the factoring amounts were included into Tupras's  indebtedness, its FFO adjusted net leverage would have reached 2x in 2012 and  about 4x in 2013-2014 before improving to under 2.5x in 2015. Tupras has  factoring limits mainly with Yapi Kredi  Factoring, a subsidiary of Yapi ve  Kredi Bankasi A.S. <YKBNK.IS> (BBB/Stable), a related party 50/50 owned by Koc Holding A.S <KCHOL.IS>, Tupras's controlling shareholder, and UniCredit S.p.A. <CRDI.MI> (BBB+/Negative), as well as with Garanti Factoring, a subsidiary of  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S. <GARAN.IS>  (BBB/Stable) and Is Factoring, a subsidiary of Turkiye Is Bankasi A.S. <ISCTR.IS>  (BBB/Stable).  Large Dividends to Continue Tupras's ratings are constrained by its generous dividend policy, which is  unlikely to change over the rating horizon, despite negative free cash flow.  Tupras pays out around 90% of its net profit or 100% of distributable income, or  the maximum allowed under the Turkish law. Fitch expects Tupras to continue its  generous dividend policy at least until 2014 because its 51%-shareholder Enerji  Yatirimlari A.S. needs to repay the remaining USD331m (end-2013 data) of  acquisition-related debt in 2014-2015.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: -Failure to improve credit ratios to levels commensurate with the 'BBB-' ratings  in 2015, ie, FFO-adjusted net leverage of below 2.5x and FFO fixed charge cover  well above 5x -Substantial delays in the RUP completion, even though we see this risk as less  likely given that the RUP was 85% complete at end-2013 -Substantially higher capex due to an expansion into upstream in 2014, leading  to slower-than- expected deleveraging - Negative rating action on the sovereign and / or substantial further  devaluation of Turkish lira beyond Fitch's expectations. A positive rating action is currently unlikely given the company's constrained  business profile as a pure downstream and marketing company and the limited  leverage headroom at the current ratings.   LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Sufficient Liquidity Tupras's end-3Q13 cash balances of TRY3.8bn more than covered TRY2bn in  short-term debt. Tupras maintains significant amounts of deposits with related  Yapi Kredi - TRY1.9bn at end-3Q13. Nearly 97% of Tupras's deposits were  denominated in USD at end-3Q13.  USD-Denominated Borrowings
