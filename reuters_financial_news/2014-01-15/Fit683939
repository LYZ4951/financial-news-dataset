Jan 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Credit default swaps (CDS) on Sears Roebuck  Acceptance Corporation [SHLDSR.UL] (Sears) have widened 39% over the past month, according  to Fitch Solutions. Sears CDS significantly underperformed the 9% CDS tightening for the broader  North America Retail CDS Index over the same time period. Additionally, the cost  of Sears credit protection has climbed to levels not seen in nearly two years.  'Worsening sentiment for Sears is likely attributed to disappointing holiday  sales and a lowered forecast for the fourth quarter,' said Director Diana  Allmendinger. Meanwhile, CDS liquidity for Sears is now trading in the second global  percentile. 'After pricing consistently tight relative to JC Penney during the  latter half of last year, CDS on Sears are now trading 90 basis points wider  than credit protection for JCP,' said  Allmendinger. Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings' Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.
