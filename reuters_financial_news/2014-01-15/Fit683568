Jan 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that Fondo de Titulizacion  de Activos Santander 2's [FDTDAB.UL](FTA Santander 2, the issuer) asset-backed commercial  paper's (ABCP) rating is not affected by recent changes to the structure. On 14  January 2014, the issuer and the liquidity facility contract were renewed for  another year. The repayment of the liquidity facility is now subordinated to  outstanding commercial paper (CP). The issuer is a single-seller ABCP programme structured to purchase short-term  receivables originated in Spain by Banco Santander <SAN.MC> (BBB+/Stable/F2). The  receivables correspond to commercial credit discounts and credit advances  provided by Banco Santander to Spanish enterprises. The conduit finances  revolving purchases via the issuance of CP. The issuer's structure has been modified to introduce total liquidity coverage  for 100% of outstanding CP. The repayment of the liquidity facility provided by  Banco Santander is subordinated to outstanding CP. Consequently, the structure  has been simplified as several protection features designed to control the  maturity gap between assets and liabilities of the issuer are no longer  necessary and have been removed.
