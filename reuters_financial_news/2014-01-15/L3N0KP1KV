Singapore, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Singapore shares ended a four-session losing streak on Wednesday, on course for their biggest daily gain in a week, as surprising strength in U.S. consumer spending reassured investors of a recovery in the world's largest economy.

The benchmark Straits Times index rose 0.5 percent to 3,140.06 by 0445 GMT, while the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was little changed. Subsidiaries of British conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.SI>, Jardine Cycle & Carriage Ltd <JCYC.SI> and Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd <JSH.SI>, were the top performers on the index. Shares of Jardine Cycle & Carriage jumped as much as 5.9 percent to a five-month high at S$39.79 in high trading volume of 1.3 times the average 30-day full-day volume. Jardine Strategic advanced as much as 2.4 percent to S$33.89, its highest in six weeks. Among other stocks, Keppel Land (KepLand) <KLAN.SI> saw its biggest daily gain in four months and rose to its highest in a week. Its shares advanced as much as 2.9 percent to S$3.24.  CIMB maintained its "buy" rating and target price of S$4.60  on KepLand despite a 13.3 percent drop in share prices since October following the third-quarter results. CIMB expects KepLand to report a fourth-quarter PATMI (profit after taxes and minority interests) of about S$240 million ($189.57 million), up 89 percent from the previous quarter.
