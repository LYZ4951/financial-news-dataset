SAO PAULO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Brazilian equities are braced for a tough year as turmoil on the road to the October presidential election and increased risk aversion among foreign and local investors are likely to spark increased market volatility, a senior executive at Fator Administração de Recursos said.

FAR, as the asset manager owned by Banco Fator SA is known, could take advantage of the rising volatility to cherry-pick infrastructure, non-discretionary consumer and financial stocks, general manager Fabio Moser told Reuters. He also said the moment is ripe to take calculated bets on complex, riskier investments that pay higher returns. Despite a 30 percent slump in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP>, calculated in U.S. dollars, in the past 12 months, Brazilian equities "are not cheap," Moser said. The Bovespa's 30-day volatility reading is now the highest among main stock indexes in the Americas and the BRIC group of emerging market nations, Thomson Reuters data showed. "This year will be a difficult year for equities but we need to be prepared to seize any buy opportunity," said Moser, a former chief investment officer at Previ, Latin America's largest workers' pension fund. "Being active and selective is key to dealing with volatility." FAR oversees 6.1 billion reais ($2.6 billion) in client money, 70 percent of which come from pension funds and insurers. Among stocks that Moser said look attractive at the moment are Fras-le SA <FRAS3.SA>, a producer of brake pads and linings, and Tupy SA <TUPY3.SA>, Latin America's largest foundry. Underperformers may include discretionary consumer and commodity stocks, which are too dependent on China, he said.  SHIFT According to strategists from banks including HSBC Securities and Citigroup Global Markets Inc, last year's market decline could extend into 2014 if macroeconomic imbalances deepen, political noise increases and global market turmoil shakes investor confidence.  In 2013, the potential withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the United States and a deterioration in Brazil's fiscal position hurt markets. The October vote, in which President Dilma Rousseff may run for re-election, is a worry to investors. Under Rousseff, some investors say, policy implementation was erratic, imbalances in the country's external sectors worsened, and state meddling in the private economy triggered steep investment losses. Polls showed that Rousseff would beat any challenger if the elections were held now. Over the past decade, investors poured hundreds of billions of dollars into the country but are now exiting positions. Such exits could create buying opportunities, Moser said. Still, the ability of local investors to take up that slack is limited as pension funds could trim exposure to local equities this year, he said. To cushion itself against a volatile equity market, FAR will expand further into credit investments, asset-backed securities and hedge fund-like products, known in Brazil as "multimercados," he said.   According to Moser, growing uncertainty is likely preventing Brazil's $1 trillion asset management industry from increasing exposure to local equities as well as private equity and real estate investment trusts, which offer juicier returns than traditional products like government debt.
