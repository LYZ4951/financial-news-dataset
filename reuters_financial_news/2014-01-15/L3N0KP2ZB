Jan 15 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, the second-largest U.S. bank, reported an eight-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit, driven by a steep fall in the bank's provisions to cover bad loans.

Net income applicable to shareholders rose to $3.18 billion, or 29 cents per share, from $367 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2012. The year-earlier profit was dented by about $5 billion of mortgage-related charges. [ID:nBw6NtRnha]
