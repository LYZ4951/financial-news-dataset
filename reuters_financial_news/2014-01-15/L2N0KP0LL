NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday, indicating the S&P 500 will build on its biggest gain in nearly a month, after earnings from Bank of America and ahead of data on inflation and manufacturing.

Bank of America <BAC.N> shares climbed 2.7 percent to $17.22 before the opening bell after the second-largest U.S. bank  reported an eight-fold jump in fourth-quarter profit, driven by a steep fall in provisions to cover bad loans. [ID:nL3N0KP2ZB]  Investors have recently been concerned that stock prices may have become extended. The S&P 500's forward price to earnings ratio is at its highest level in nearly seven years. The benchmark S&P 500 surged about 30 percent in 2013. "We've been in a bit of a battle between the urge of some investors to take some profits here and the upcoming earnings announcements and whether they can support the now-higher valuations - the next two weeks are really critical to investors deciding whether earnings are sufficient to justify prices," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.   "It's not just enough for the economy to recover, corporate earnings have to recover as well to match the higher valuations that 2013 brought."  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  U.S. Morning Call: Bank of America profit soars in Q4  http://reut.rs/1gW5CmT ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Economic data due at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) includes Empire State manufacturing survey for January and the producer price index for December.

Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> gained 39 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> added 13 points. The S&P 500 <.SPX> rose 1.1 percent on Tuesday, its biggest climb since Dec. 18, as a strong December retail sales reading eased concerns that economic growth might be slowing and stocks may be expensive.

General Motors Co <GM.N> said it will pay the first quarterly dividend on its common stock in almost six years.
