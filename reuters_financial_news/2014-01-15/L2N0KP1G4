RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index jumped 1 percent on Wednesday as shares of state-run oil company Petrobras gained on speculation of a possible fuel price hike later this year.

Preferred shares of Petroleo Brasileiro SA <PETR4.SA>, as the Brazilian oil company is formally known, gained 2.1 percent after newspaper Folha de S.Paulo said in its online edition that the government and the company board are considering increasing fuel prices in June or even in March. Folha said its reporting was based on sources at President Dilma Rousseff's economic team. Petrobras has repeatedly declined to comment on its pricing policy.  Traders said the report further boosted shares of Petrobras, which lost nearly 9 percent of its value last year as the government forced the company to sell gasoline and diesel in Brazil under market prices to keep inflation in check.  Other Latin American stock indexes also rose on Wednesday as investors tracked gains on Wall Street. "We're again taking a ride along with overseas markets. It will likely remain like that until we get better numbers for the domestic economy," said Alvaro Bandeira, a partner with Órama Investimentos.* Shares of Brazil's state-run electricity utility Eletrobrás <ELET6.SA> slumped 2.9 percent, the most among the components of the Bovespa index, after regulators decided the company needs to return about 2 billion reais ($851 million) to a sector fund it manages. * Brazil's Embraer shares <EMBR3.SA> climbed 1.4 percent after the world's largest maker of regional aircraft announced it met its 2013 delivery targets after a surge in sales in the fourth quarter.
