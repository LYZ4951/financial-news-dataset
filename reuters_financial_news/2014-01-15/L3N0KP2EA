HANOI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed up 0.84 percent on Wednesday, the ninth straight gain, as investors bought several blue chips with expectation the government would soon allow foreign investors to own more in listed firms, analysts said.

Shares of the companies, in which foreign holdings are at limit, advanced. Sai Gon Securities Incorp <SSI.HM> rose 5.13 percent, technology firm FPT <FPT.HM> increased 1.63 percent and Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Corp <REE.HM> gained 0.96 percent. The government could raise foreign ownership limit to 60 percent, from 49 percent now, in some listed firm within two weeks, analysts said. [ID:nL3N0K90NI] Investors also bought speculative stocks in the real estate sector, after a Rockefeller firm has agreed to develop a $2.5 billion resort project in Vietnam. [ID:nL3N0KO2CR] Shares of property firm Tan Tao Investment and Industry Corp <ITA.HM> jumped 6.15 percent, while its volume hit a record high of 23.1 million shares, Reuters data showed. The index, which has advanced for nine consecutive sessions, might rise beyond its resistance level of 530-533 points within two weeks, analysts said. The political crisis in Thailand has also prompted foreign investors to search opportunity in Vietnam's stock market, analysts said.  The VN Index is Southeast Asia's best performer in 2013.
