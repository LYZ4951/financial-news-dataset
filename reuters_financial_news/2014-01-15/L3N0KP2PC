MUMBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Indian shares rallied on Wednesday to mark their highest close in five weeks as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> rose after data showing sharply easing inflation reinforced expectations the central bank will keep interest rates on hold.

Headline inflation eased to a five-month low of 6.16 percent in December, helped by a softening in vegetable prices, data released Wednesday showed. [ID:nENNE1B0RY] The drop in wholesale inflation came on the back of the fall in retail inflation to a three-month low, reinforcing expectations of a status quo by the Reserve Bank of India at its policy review meet on Jan. 28. After raising interest rates by 50 basis points over September and October, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan held rates steady last month, saying inflation data would largely determine the outlook for interest rates. Gains also tracked higher Asian shares on Wednesday as the World Bank upgraded its outlook for the global economy, while the dollar extended gains in the wake of surprising strength in U.S. consumer spending. [MKTS/GLOB] "More upside can be seen in Indian equities, led by banking and consumer durable stocks as rate reduction chances are brightening. RBI has also managed growth and the currency part well," said Deven Choksey, managing director at KR Choksey Securities.
