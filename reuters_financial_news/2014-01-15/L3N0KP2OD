MUMBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Indian shares rallied on Wednesday to mark their highest close in five weeks as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank rose after data showing sharply easing inflation reinforced expectations the central bank will keep interest rates on hold.

ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> and Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS> provisionally rose 2.3 percent each.
