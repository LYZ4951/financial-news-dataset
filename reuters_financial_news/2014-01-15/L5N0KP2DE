LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have sent investigators to Citigroup's <C.N> London headquarters as part of an international investigation into alleged manipulation of the global currency market, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.

This comes after Citi last week fired its head of European spot foreign exchange trading Rohan Ramchandani, following a prolonged period on leave. [ID:nL2N0KK299] The Fed and OCC officials, who have been at Citi's Canary Wharf office in London this week, are at the preliminary stage of information-gathering and their presence is "independent" of Ramchandani's sacking, the source said.  The Federal Reserve and OCC, which is an independent bureau of the U.S. Treasury, both declined to comment. A spokesman for Citigroup also declined to comment.
