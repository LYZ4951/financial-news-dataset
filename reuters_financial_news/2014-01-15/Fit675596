Jan 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned E-Carat, Compartment No. 6's class A notes and class B notes expected ratings, as follows: EURTBD class A notes, due September 2021: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EURTBD class B notes, due September 2021: 'AA-(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EURTBD Subordinated Note, NR(EXP) The final ratings will be contingent upon the receipt of final documents  conforming to the information already received to support the agency's  analytical approach.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect the pool's expected asset performance, available credit  enhancement for the class A and B notes, the transaction's legal structure and  the sound origination and servicing procedures of GMAC Bank GmbH [GMADOB.UL] (GMACB;  BB+/Positive/B). Credit enhancement for the class A and B notes is 9.0% and 5.0%, respectively.  It is provided by subordination of the subordinated note for the class B notes,  and by the class B notes and the subordinated note for the class A notes.  Additionally, the transaction benefits from an amortising reserve fund of 1.90%  of the initial portfolio balance and substantial initial excess spread. Both  provide credit enhancement in case losses are recorded in the principal  deficiency ledger. The liquidity reserve can also be used to cover shortfalls  for the payment of senior items, senior swap payments and interest on the class  A and B notes. At legal final maturity, the remaining liquidity reserve will be  used to redeem the notes. Fitch assumed a base case loss rate of 1.0% from the total book loss data it  received from GMACB. The agency concluded that the observed loss rates of post  2008 vintages were low compared with peers. In the absence of GMACB-specific  static default and recovery data, the agency set the loss assumption slightly  below the worst-performing 2007/2008 vintages. The loss rate is still at the  lower end of the expected loss rates assigned to peer transactions.  Fitch has also considered the additional risks arising from the balloon loans.  Considering the share of the balloon portion of 42% of the discounted  preliminary pool balance, the agency adjusted its default rate multiple in the  'AAAsf" and 'AA-sf' scenario to account for this risk. The transaction benefits from an appointed back-up servicer (Sitel), which  commits to act as the replacement servicer upon termination of the servicing  agreement. In practice, Sitel currently services GMACB's loan portfolio for up  to 120 days in arrears. In Fitch's opinion, the appointment of Sitel as a  servicer reduces the risk of any significant servicing disruption in the event  of GMACB's insolvency.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The transaction's performance is sensitive to increased defaults in the  portfolio. Fitch considers unemployment the main default driver of fixed rate  auto loans with private customers, which make up the majority of the pool. Fitch  expects German unemployment to remain at historical low levels over the  transaction's life. Fitch has applied a high default stress multiple of 6.7 to  account for the impact of unexpected economic deterioration on the portfolio and  to capture refinancing risk arising from balloon contracts.  The ratings would also be sensitive to recoveries from defaulted loans being  significantly lower than expected, e.g. in case of a severe downturn of the  German used car market. Unremedied counterparty risk e.g. in the case of unhedged interest rate risk  following the swap counterparty's default or lost funds following a default of  the account bank can also create downward pressure on the ratings.  TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS This transaction is a true sale securitisation of German auto loans originated  by GMACB. GMACB's two holding companies, previously owned by General Motors  Financial Company, Inc. [GMGMN.UL] (GMF), were acquired by GM Europe Service GmbH (GM  Europe), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of GM, in December 2013. GMACB  continues to be managed by and consolidated under its former parent, GMF. The  class A notes and B notes are euro-denominated and pay a floating rate. Due to  the fixed rate assets, an interest rate swap is in place to hedge the mismatch  between the assets and the liabilities. This is GMACB's sixth public  securitisation of German auto loans. The preceding deal was rated by Fitch in  March 2013.  The transaction is static and will start amortising from closing. The  preliminary portfolio as of December 2013 consists of 44,415 loans, with an  outstanding aggregate discounted principal balance of EUR484.6m. 19% of the pool  balance consists of amortising loans, balloon loans account for 81%. The  vehicles financed are new cars (82%) and used cars (18%).
