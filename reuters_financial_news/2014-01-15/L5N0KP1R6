CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Most economists surveyed by Reuters think Egypt's central bank will keep interest rates on hold on Thursday as it tries to support economic growth while keeping inflation in check.

Urban consumer inflation in the most populous Arab country is still high at an annual 11.7 percent, down from a four-year high of 13 percent in November.

[ID:nL6N0KO08M] Five economists surveyed by Reuters expected the central bank to leave rates unchanged on Thursday, while two forecast a 50 basis points cut. "They might take a pause to see how effective previous rate cuts were," said Mohamed Abou Basha, Cairo-based economist at EFG-Hermes. "Everyone is still looking at the referendum, you wouldn't expect much to happen this month." At its last policy meeting, the central bank unexpectedly cut its main interest rates by 50 basis points, saying it was more concerned about boosting growth than taming inflation. [ID:nL5N0JK44T] It lowered its overnight deposit rate to 8.25 percent, its overnight lending rate to 9.25 percent, and the discount rate and the rate it uses to price one-week repurchase and deposit operations to 8.75 percent. It had reduced rates in August and September by a cumulative 100 basis points.Since the 2011 uprising which hammered tourism revenues and foreign investment, the bank has spent tens of billions of dollars supporting its currency <EGP=> which is still trading weaker on the black market than on the official one. The central bank sold the pound at a cut-off price of 6.9522 to the dollar on Wednesday <CBEO>, while one market participant quoted the black market rate at a much weaker 7.36. The central bank is under pressure to keep interest rates high to attract funds out of foreign currencies and into the Egyptian pound, although high rates hurt local businesses looking to borrow. Still, some economists said the bank could cut rates more. "The drop in inflation gave the MPC room for another 50 (basis points) cut in the rates. I assume the committee will take advantage of the relaxation in the inflation rate," said Ahmad Al Telfah, chief economist at Riyad Bank. Political instability since the uprising that toppled autocrat President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 has driven tourists and investors away, damaging the economy.  Egypt faced another setback when the army ousted the Islamist Mursi, the country's first freely-elected head of state, after mass protests against his rule last summer. The government launched a 29.6 billion Egyptian pound ($4.3 billion) stimulus package last year to boost the economy, after Gulf countries pledged $12 billion in aid. It plans to spend around 30 billion pounds on a second package to begin early this year.
