LAGOS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira currency firmed against the dollar on the interbank market on Wednesday, supported by large greenback sales by one local lender and a multinational oil company.

The local currency closed at 159.45 to the dollar, firmer than Monday's close of 159.68 to the dollar. Traders said a local bank sold an undisclosed amount of dollars toward the close of trading, while a unit of Eni <ENI.MI> sold about $5 million, which boosted dollar liquidity and provided support for the naira. The naira has hovered around 158.80-159.85 to the dollar since the start of the year, helped by dollar flows from some oil companies and offshore investors buying local debt.
