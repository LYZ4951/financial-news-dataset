FRANKFURT, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The key euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rate rose on Wednesday as the amount of surplus funds in the financial system fell, tightening the money market.

Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=>, or money banks have beyond what they need for their day-by-day operations, dipped to 154 billion euros ($211 billion) from 155 billion on Tuesday.  The amount had risen to over 280 billion euros towards the end of last year as banks increased their liquidity buffers to avert year-end money market tension.  As the new year got on its way, excess liquidity came back down, which increased upward pressure on money market rates. Liquidity is draining from the market as banks repay crisis loans they took from the European Central Bank in late 2011 and early 2012 to ride out a period of strained funding conditions. The repayments will resume this week after pausing over the turn of the year to avoid a liquidity squeeze. On Friday, the ECB said banks would return 2.566 billion euros ($3.51 billion) on Wednesday, which was less than expected in a Reuters poll. The three-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR3MD=>, traditionally the main gauge of unsecured bank-to-bank lending, rose to 0.290 percent on Wednesday from 0.282 percent. The six-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR6MD=> rose to 0.397 percent from 0.390 percent and the shorter-term one-week rate <EURIBORSWD=> increased to 0.184 percent from 0.174 percent. Overnight Eonia <EONIA=> inched lower to 0.147 percent from 0.153 percent on Tuesday. The market moves played out as European Central Bank policymakers appeared at odds over their readiness to take fresh policy action. Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Tuesday he saw no need for immediate policy action. But ECB Vice President  Vitor Constancio said that in the current low-inflation environment, the ECB can look at some of the instruments at its disposal to pursue its secondary mandate of lowering unemployment and fostering growth.
