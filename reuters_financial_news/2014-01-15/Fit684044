Jan 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The last-minute intervention at  the weekend by Indonesia's politicians to avert a significant disruption of  mining activity and exports, should limit any further stress on the sovereign  rating for now, says Fitch Ratings. Indonesia has implemented a new mining law  which aims to raise the value-added nature of mining sector activity by limiting  exports of certain raw, unrefined products. This comes at a time when the  Indonesian rupiah has fallen nearly 22% from a year ago amid concerns over  external financing needs and the onset of Fed tapering. A key near-term uncertainty surrounding the country's external payments position  has been lifted. However, medium-term risks remain, as the manner and the  late-stage at which the underlying issues were addressed does little for  long-term investor sentiment. The presidential regulation comes at a particularly sensitive time, as an  outright ban on mineral exports without the granted exemptions could have  weighed on Indonesia's external balance - which has emerged as a point of  vulnerability for the sovereign's overall credit profile (BBB-/Stable). This is  evident from its gross external funding requirement which is expected at 50% of  reserves in 2014, and which is more stretched than the 36% for 'BBB-' peers. A broad-based ban on exports would not have only damaged international  investors' perceptions of doing business in Indonesia, but also slowed mining  output and weighed on overall economic activity. Indonesia's current account (CA) deficit seems to be improving as the trade  balance has moved into surplus recently, but the process remains slow and  vulnerable to external shocks. We project the CA deficit at 3.1% for 2014 versus  3.6% estimated in 2013. Tighter monetary policies have been implemented in the  second half of 2013 to lower credit growth and rein in aggregate demand.  This policy adjustment, coupled with greater currency flexibility, is helping to  bring about a trade balance adjustment and a gradual rebuilding of  foreign-currency reserves - which have risen to USD99.4bn by end-December 2013  from a low of USD92.7 in July 2013. Reserves will be further boosted in January  by the sovereign's USD4bn debt issue. These are credit supportive developments,  but they remain at an early stage and could have been pressured by a sudden  stoppage of mining exports. Mineral exports will still face some impediments. These now have to meet certain  levels of "purity", and cannot be exported in their raw or entirely unprocessed  form. Precise details of exemptions remain unclear, but mineral exports will now  be subject to a 20% tax even after they meet the "purity" level. In addtion, the  export tax is set to rise much higher in 2016, to 60%, to get producers to raise  the refining (processed) content to much higher levels by 2017. The Indonesian authorities continue to pursue the longer-term objective of  raising the domestic value-added content in mining activity. But the speed and  manner in which these measures have been introduced and communicated to industry  and market participants have often raised uncertainties over production,  exports, and the broader economy. It is far from clear if the recent,  last-minute, intervention does much to reassure long-term investor sentiment.
