SYDNEY, May 26 (Reuters) - Australian private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners said on Monday it had offered to buy risk management and standards compliance business SAI Global Ltd <SAI.AX> for up to A$1.1 billion ($1 billion) and take it private.

SAI said it was considering the offer and also that it had  terminated Chief Executive Officer Stephen Porges's employment because of "fundamental differences of opinion between him and the board".
