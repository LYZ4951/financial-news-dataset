HANOI, May 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rallied 0.47 percent on Monday to close at 544.06 points on gains in some blue-chips, but analysts expect the index to decline in the near future.

Hanoi-based lender Vietcombank <VCB.HM> led the gains, with shares rising 3.8 percent, followed by food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> with a 1.68 percent rise.  Money also flowed into speculative stocks, said Le Dac An, an analyst from Tan Viet Securities. Property firms FLC Group <FLC.HM> climbed 6.73 percent while Hoang Quan Corp <HQC.HM> was up 2.99 percent. "Rises in speculative stocks suggested a short-term gain for the market as investors would snap quick profits near the index's resistance level of 550 points," An said.
