PRAGUE, May 26 (Reuters) - Inflation expectations in the Czech Republic are anchored around the central bank's target of 2 percent, Vice-Governor Vladimir Tomsik was quoted as saying on Monday.

"The anchor of stability of inflation expectations at the level around the two-percent target is not under threat in the Czech economy," Tomsik wrote in an article in magazine Bankovnictvi.  The central bank's board agreed at its last policy meeting on May 7 that there was a higher probability of a later exit from its exchange rate intervention regime, which it launched in November 2013, than the beginning of 2015, which it had signalled earlier.
