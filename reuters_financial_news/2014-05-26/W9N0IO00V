WELLINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand insurance company Tower Ltd <TWR.NZ> posted a 70 percent fall in half-year profit on Tuesday due to a rise in claims from severe weather events, while its income has been cut following recent divestments.

The company said profit after tax was NZ$13.1 million ($11.21 million) in the six months to March 31, compared with NZ$44.2 million in the same period last year. It announced a dividend of 6.5 cents per share, up from 5 cents a year ago.  Tower said it faced an increase in claims in recent months following floods and cyclones in New Zealand's South Island.
