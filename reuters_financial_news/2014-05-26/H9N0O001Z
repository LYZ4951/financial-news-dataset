HONG KONG, May 26 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished flat on Monday, as weakness in energy counters offset strength in Chinese car makers.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed flat at 22,963.18 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was up 0.1 percent. Leading H-share gainers were Great Wall Motor <2333.HK>, which climbed 3.7 percent and Guangzhou Automobile Group <2238.HK>, up 3.1 percent. They rose after comments from President Xi Jinping on the industry's need to develop energy-efficient cars.
