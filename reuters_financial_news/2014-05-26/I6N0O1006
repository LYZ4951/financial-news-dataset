MILAN, May 26 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian banks rallied in early trade on Monday, leading gains on the Milan bourse, after Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's centre-left party thriumphed in Sunday's European elections, in sharp contrast with a rising tide of Euroscepticism elsewhere.

By 0711 GMT, Italy's biggest two banks, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI> were up nearly 4 percent. Mid-tier banks like Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> and UBI <UBI.MI> were up nearly 6 percent, better than a 2.7 percent rise in the blue-chip index FTSE MIB <.FTMIB>. The PD won a historic 40.8 percent of votes against 21.2 percent for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and in contrast with a massive protest vote that led to a victory of the far right in France and Britain.

"The market is however likely to focus on the potentially destabilising impact of the advance of the Eurosceptic vote across Europe."
