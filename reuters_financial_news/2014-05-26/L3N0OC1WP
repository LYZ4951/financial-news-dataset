HONG KONG, May 26 (Reuters) - Middle East private equity firm Abraaj Group has bought into an education provider in Thailand, betting on a country that last week saw the imposition of military rule after months of wrangling between government and anti-government activists.

Abraaj, which manages $7.5 billion, said in a statement on Monday that it had bought a stake in out-of-school education provider KPN Academy, without disclosing the purchase price. The deal comes at a time of reduced corporate buying-and-selling activity in Southeast Asia's No. 2 economy, brought about by political instability. [ID:nL3N0OC0RZ] The value of initial public offerings has tumbled 72 percent so far in 2014 from a year earlier to $647.6 million, while that of mergers and acquisitions has fallen 60 percent to $2.8 billion, showed Thomson Reuters data. In April, consumer confidence hit its lowest in over 12 years. [ID:nL3N0OB02M] "The rising middle class in Asia, and beyond, is increasingly looking to supplement their family's education with out-of-school services," Srisant Chitvaranund, an Abraaj managing director, said in the statement without mentioning the political situation. Established in 2000, KPN Academy has over 103 centres across Thailand, offering a variety of subjects including Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Social Sciences.
