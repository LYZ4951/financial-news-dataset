FRANKFURT, May 26 (Reuters) - Germany's cartel office on Monday said it had launched an in-depth assessment of German auto parts maker Continental AG's <CONG.DE> planned takeover of U.S. rubber firm Veyance Technologies.

The probe is expected to run until at least Aug. 25 and will evaluate the potential market impact of the deal, a spokesman for the cartel office said.
