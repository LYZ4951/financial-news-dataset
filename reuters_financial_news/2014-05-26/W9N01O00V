WELLINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand insurance company Tower Ltd <TWR.NZ> on Tuesday said it would buy shares from shareholders with fewer than 200 shares at a price of NZ$1.72 ($1.47) per share, in response to requests from some small shareholders to cancel their shares.

Tower's announcement came after it reported a 70 percent slide in profits earlier in the day. [ID:nW9N0IO00V]
