MUMBAI, May 26 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell on Monday, giving up earlier gains of nearly 2 percent, due to profit-taking in blue-chips including state-run companies such as IDFC <IDFC.NS> while caution ahead of Narendra Modi's ministerial appointments also weighed.

IDFC provisionally fell 5.3 percent while Tata Power Co <TTPW.NS> ended 3.9 percent lower.
