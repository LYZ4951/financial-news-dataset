BANGKOK, May 26 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks mostly fell on Monday, with Thai shares declining for a second day as caution remained after a military coup last week, while Malaysia hit its lowest close in more than two weeks on selling by local investors.

The Thai SET index <.SETI> ended down 0.6 percent at 1,388.29, coming off the day's low of 1,381.01. Shares of PTT <PTT.BK>, the country's top energy firm by market capitalisation, dropped 2.6 percent amid concerns about possible energy reforms by the military government, brokers said. But builders such as Ch Karnchang <CK.BK> jumped on expectation that the military government would speed up disbursements for infrastructure projects that had been put on hold during months of political unrest, while consumer stocks, including Charoen Pokphand Foods <CPF.BK>, gained ahead of economic policies next week.
