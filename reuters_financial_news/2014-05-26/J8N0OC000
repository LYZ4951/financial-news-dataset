NAIROBI, May 26 (Reuters) - Kenya's central bank holds adequate foreign exchange reserves to cushion the shilling against temporary shocks that left the local currency trading at two-and-a-half year lows late last week, the bank's governor said on Monday.

Governor Njuguna Ndung'u blamed seasonal factors including the payment of corporate dividends to foreign shareholders for the volatility.
