MADRID, May 26 (Reuters) - Spanish oil major Repsol <REP.MC> plans to seek board approval on Wednesday to distribute 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to shareholders in the form of a one-euro-per-share special dividend, the El Pais newspaper reported on Monday, without citing sources.

Repsol declined to comment. The company has raised over $6 billion in recent weeks after selling Argentine bonds and its remaining stake in YPF <YPFD.BA>, completing its exit from the country following the 2012 expropriation of a majority stake in YPF. This month Repsol said it would use funds to buy exploration and production assets but also left the door open to paying a special dividend or buying back its own stock. Its monthly board meeting is on Wednesday.
