May 26 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Eirles Two Limited Series 364's accreting zero coupon secured notes and revised its Outlook as follows: USD100m accreting zero coupon secured notes due May 2043 affirmed at 'A+sf';  Outlook revised to Negative from Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating addresses the repayment of the accreted principal on the notes  according to the terms and conditions of the documentation. The rating reflects  the credit quality of two risk-presenting entities as well as the issuer's legal  and financial structure. The two risk-presenting entities are Deutsche Bank, AG,  London Branch (DB; A+/Negative/F1+) and France (AA+/Stable/F1+). The Negative  Outlook of the notes addresses the Negative Outlook on DB. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the notes is driven by that of the lowest-rated risk entity in  this transaction, DB. As a result, a rating downgrade of up to two notches to  France will not affect the 'A+sf' of the notes. Should the rating of DB be  downgraded or upgraded by one notch, with all else being equal, the notes'  rating would be downgraded or upgraded correspondingly.  The issued notes bear no interest. However, their principal notional will  accrete at an annual rate of 7% in the first year, 2.35% in the second year and  4.65% in the subsequent years till 2043. The issuer pays the swap counterparty  all interest and principal received on the collaterals and the swap counterparty  will pay the accreted principal amount due to the noteholders at redemption. According to the transaction documents, on the first business day after the  issue date, the issuer exchanged the original collateral with DB to receive  eligible collateral with a principal amount that is greater or equal to the  principal amount of the notes of USD100m. The collateral after the exchange is a  cash deposit of USD 105.3m, held with the deposit bank, Deutsche Bank Trust  Company Americas [DBKGK.UL] (DBTCA, A+/Negative/F1+) in a segregated account. Fitch  considers the default risk of DB and DBTCA to be highly correlated and therefore  views DB and DBTCA as one risk-presenting entity in the transaction.
