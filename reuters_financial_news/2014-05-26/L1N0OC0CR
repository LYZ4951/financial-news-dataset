MOSCOW, May 26 (Reuters) - Russian bank VTB <VTBR.MM> is expected to report an 18 percent fall in net profit in the first three months of this year on the back of higher loan loss provisions following a deterioration in the Ukrainian and Russian economies, analysts said.

VTB's first-quarter net profit, to be reported on Tuesday, is expected to have fallen to 12.9 billion roubles ($378 million), according to the average forecast in a poll of analysts, from 15.7 billion in the same period of 2013. VTB, Russia's second-biggest bank behind Sberbank <SBER.MM> by assets, has previously said its exposure to Ukraine is 20 billion roubles and its operations there amount to about 2-3 percent of the bank's total operations. It has said that it still considers Ukraine to be one of its key markets. Ukraine's economy is expected to slide deeper into recession this year, while Russia is on the brink of recession after quarterly GDP fell by 0.5 percent in the first quarter.
