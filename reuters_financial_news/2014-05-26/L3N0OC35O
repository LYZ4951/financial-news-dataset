May 26 (Reuters) - Multi-website online retailer The Hut will not go ahead with a previously announced listing on the London Stock Exchange amid concerns about unsustainable technology valuations and share volatility, The Financial Times reported late on Monday.

The British newspaper reported The Hut Chief Executive Matthew Moulding as saying even if the company had floated at a sensible valuation, there was a risk the share price would be pushed to unsustainable levels before correcting.

London has been a particular hot spot for capital, as firms tap yield-hungry investors, and private equity groups cash in on strong equity markets to exit investments made before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. British retailers Poundland <PLND.L>, Boohoo <BOOH.L> and Patisserie <CAKEP.L> Valerie have all floated in recent weeks.  However, lukewarm demand for shares in retailers like Card Factory Plc <CARDC.L> is the latest sign interest in European company flotations may be cooling somewhat after a red-hot start to the year.
