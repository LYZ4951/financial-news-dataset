FRANKFURT, May 26 (Reuters) - The size of the European Central Bank's dormant government bond purchase programme dipped to 164.5 billion euros ($224.24 billion) last week as a volume of 2.909 billion euros worth matured, the ECB said on Monday.

The ECB terminated its Securities Markets Programme (SMP) in September 2012, replacing it with an as yet unused plan called Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).
