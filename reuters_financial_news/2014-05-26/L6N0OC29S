BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators will decide by July 2 whether to approve British telecoms group Vodafone's <VOD.L> 7.2-billion-euro ($9.81 billion) bid for Spanish cable operator Ono, the European Commission said on Monday.

Vodafone unveiled the proposed takeover in March to reinforce it against market leader Telefonica <TEF.MC>. The deal, Vodafone's third acquisition of a European fixed and broadband asset in two years, could trigger more consolidation in the industry. The EU competition authority could clear the deal, demand concessions or open a lengthy investigation if it has concerns about the impact on consumers and rivals.
