MUMBAI, May 26 (Reuters) - Indian shares fall, giving up earlier gains of nearly 2 percent due to profit-taking in shares of state-run companies such as Bank of Baroda <BOB.NS> while caution ahead of Narendra Modi's ministerial appointments also weighed.

Bank of Baroda shares slumped 8 percent, Bharat Heavy Electricals <BHEL.NS> fell 6 percent while NTPC <NTPC.NS> fell 5.5 percent.
