MOSCOW, May 26 (Reuters) - Russia's top mobile phone operator MTS <MTSS.MM><MBT.N> is expected to post a 4 percent increase in first-quarter net profit in a sign of resilience to a weaker economy and the Ukraine crisis, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

The average of forecasts from 11 banks and brokerages was for net profit of 13.5 billion roubles ($395 million), up from about 13 billion roubles in the first quarter of 2013. Analysts also forecast a 4.8 percent year-on-year rise in operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) on the back of a 4.5 percent rise in revenue - in line with the company's full-year 2014 guidance for a 2 percent increase in OIBDA and 3-5 percent revenue growth. MTS said in February that sales growth is likely to slow this year from 5.3 percent in 2013, adjusting guidance to take into account Russia's slower economic growth. MTS repeated its forecast in March, but the outlook for Russia's economy has since soured because of Western sanctions over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine, where MTS is the No.2 player. The company's chief executive Andrei Dubovskov signalled last week that the guidance was still intact as he told Reuters that he did not see any threatening signs for the mobile business.

"We continue to expect Russian mobile firms to face headwinds in upcoming quarters, some of which may not yet be fully priced in or visible in Q1," Citi Research said, adding that competitive dynamics in Russia and political and economic risks remained the key short-term challenges. "While Q1 is likely to be fairly decent, we think that weak macro in key markets may start impacting results going forward, and we will be looking for an update on consumer trends in Russia and operating trends in Ukraine," said Igor Semenov, a telecoms analyst at Deutsche Bank.
