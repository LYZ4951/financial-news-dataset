LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Britain's financial services firms saw an unexpected fall in profit in the three months to June, after six quarters of strong rises - the result of increased competition and costs, an industry survey showed on Monday.

Profits fell by 5 percent compared with expectations for a rise of 30 percent, according to the latest quarterly CBI/PwC financial services survey. Incomes from fees, commissions or premiums fell by 10 percent, disappointing a previous forecast for rapid growth of 34 percent. Kevin Burrowes, PWC's UK financial services leader, said banks and insurers were seeing a growing competitive threat from non-financial services companies and new entrants trying to capitalise on improved economic conditions. "This suggests that UK financial services will see increasing pricing pressure. There is now a growing willingness to partner with technology firms and emerging rivals," he said. Burrowes added that regulation would remain a major concern and a key driver of operating costs. Despite that, firms reported a rise in business activity in the three months to June and optimism for the future continued to pick up across the sector.
