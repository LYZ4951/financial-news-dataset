June 29 (Reuters) - Gardner Denver has agreed to pay $29 million to its former shareholders to settle allegations that the industrial pumps producer was undervalued in its $3.7 billion sale to private equity firm KKR & Co <KKR.N> last year, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The settlement was filed Friday in a Delaware court and must still be approved by a judge, the paper said in its online edition late on Saturday. Shareholders sued Gardner Denver, its board and KKR, saying that the sale price was too low.
