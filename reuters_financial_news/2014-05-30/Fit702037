May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Early forecasts for the 2014 hurricane season indicate  that moderate El Nino conditions are likely to persist throughout the year,  according to Fitch Ratings' annual Hurricane Outlook. This could inhibit  tropical storm formation in the North Atlantic basin and decrease the  probability of a major loss-inducing storm impacting the insurance industry. Fitch estimates that given the current substantial level of industry  capitalization, it would likely take a record individual storm loss or a series  of significant losses equal to 15% or more of industry aggregate surplus for  consideration of a property/casualty sector outlook movement to negative tied to  catastrophe experience. 'From the perspective of the insurance industry, the intensity and location of  storms making landfall are the most critical variables,' says Christopher  Grimes, Director. 'While fewer and less severe storms bode well for the  industry, the property/casualty segment remains positioned to withstand the  impact of future significant events.' The capital markets remain a strong and growing presence in the market for  underwriting and offering protection from catastrophe risks. The continued low  interest rate environment, along with the desire of (re)insurance companies to  utilize alternatives to the traditional insurance risk transfer market, has  generated significant growth in new capital from third-party investors. The  process of insuring higher catastrophe-exposed areas, including Florida,  continues to evolve as insurers of high-risk property expand their use of  insurance linked securities (ILS). This is the ninth edition of Fitch's annual hurricane season desk reference,  providing analysis on the potential effects of a major storm season on large  insurance companies and the industry as a whole. The report also compares  forecasts for the 2014 hurricane season from several market experts, including  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Colorado State  University (CSU) and Tropical Storm Research (TSR).
