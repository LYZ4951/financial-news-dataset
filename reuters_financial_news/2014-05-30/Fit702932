May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has downgraded Singapore-based First Ship Lease Trust's <FSLT.SI> (FSLT) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'B-' from 'B'. The Outlook is Stable. The downgrade reflects weakness in FSLT's portfolio asset quality following  defaults by two lessees, Geden Holdings and OMNI Ships, in 2013, which resulted  in a decline in FSLT's revenue and EBITDA. FSLT had been in discussion with its  lenders since September 2013 to negotiate a further set of covenant relaxation  terms. Immediate liquidity concerns have eased following an extension of relaxed  loan covenants until December 2014, and recent vessel sales have further  improved the liquidity position. FSLT's current bareboat lessees are of adequate  credit quality, and Fitch expects FSLT to generate adequate operating cash flows  to meet its debt servicing commitments and other operational expenses. Fitch  does not expect FSLT's credit metrics to improve significantly in the medium  term.   KEY RATING DRIVERS: Materially Weaker Credit Metrics: At end-2013, EBITDA debt service coverage  ratio was 0.91x, which was weaker than Fitch's expectations and below the bank  loan covenant threshold of 1.0x. Two of FSLT's lessees, Geden Holdings and OMNI  Ships, which together accounted for 24% of FSLT's 12-month bareboat charter  revenues, defaulted in July and September 2013 respectively. This resulted in a  15% drop in 2013 revenue to USD89.99m and a 19% drop in EBITDAR to USD62.56m. In  February 2014, FSLT secured an extension of relaxation in its bank loan  covenants to 31 December 2014, which alleviated immediate liquidity pressure.  Proceeds from vessel sales have been directed to debt reduction, which has  enabled FSLT to comply with the relaxed bank loan covenant of an EBITDA debt  service coverage ratio of 0.90x for 1Q14.   Vessel Sales Fund Debt Reduction: FSLT sold two loss making vessels, the Stella  Fomalhaut and the FSL Durban, in 1Q14 for USD23.55m cash. This transaction  resulted in FSLT recognising a loss of USD1.41m. The sale proceeds and its cash  balance of USD20.37m as at end-2013 were used to fund a USD22m loan prepayment  and an USD8.5m contractual loan repayment. Gross term debt as of 31 March 2014  was USD347.30m (end-2013: USD377.49m). Contractual principal repayment after the  prepayment has reduced to USD39m per annum from USD44m in 2013. FSLT's free cash generation and its unrestricted cash of USD10.64m at end-1Q14  should enable the trust to comfortably cover its contractual principal  repayments. In addition, debt repayment is not overly onerous because Fitch  expects FSLT to sustain positive free cash flows (FCF).  Adequate Contracted Revenue Visibility: FSLT's remaining bareboat charter  lessees - Yang Ming, Evergreen, James Fisher and Schoeller are of acceptable  credit quality. Contracted revenue in 2014 and 2015 is USD47m and USD40m  respectively. This and the time charter, spot and pool revenues should enable  the trust to meet its debt servicing commitments till end-2015. Unit Distribution to Limit Metric Improvement: While Fitch expects cash flow  from operations of USD45m-50m per annum for 2014-2016, FSLT could be required to  make unit distributions from 2015 and therefore Fitch expects only modest  improvement in FSLT's credit metrics.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include - FSLT's cash available for debt service, that is, (Unrestricted cash + FCF +  interest expense + unit distributions) / (interest expense + contractual  principal repayment of USD39m + unit distributions), falls below 1.2x on a  sustained basis due to further lease default (2013: 1.05x).
