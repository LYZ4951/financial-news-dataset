May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Fosse 2014-1 notes issued by  Fosse Master Issuer plc (the master issuer), expected ratings, as follows: Class A1 floating-rate notes: 'F1+(EXP)sf' Class A2 floating-rate notes: 'AAA(EXP)sf', Stable Outlook  The assignment of the final ratings is subject to the receipt of final documents  conforming to information already received.  The master trust property consists of prime residential owner-occupied mortgage  loans originated in the UK by Alliance & Leicester Plc (A&L) and, following the  Part VII scheme effected in May 2010, mortgage loans originated by Santander UK  plc <SANS_p.L> (Santander, rated A/Stable/F1). Credit enhancement of 24.88% for the class A notes is provided by the class B  (1.97%), together with the unrated Z (20.19%) notes and a fully funded reserve  fund (2.72%).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Short Legal Final Maturity Notes The issue includes a tranche of class 2a7 notes, which are due to mature in  April 2015, with a scheduled amortisation payment three months prior to final  maturity. The issue represents a large proportion of the overall trust size. To make the payment, the structure relies on a large accumulation of principal  receipts occurring over a period of three months and would use the reserve fund  in a low prepayment scenario. Fitch has found in further analysis that after  making the note payment there would be sufficient funds in the reserve fund to  cover payment interruption.  Missing Prior Arrears Data  As per previous transactions, Santander supplied adverse data for county court  judgements (CCJ) and bankruptcy/ individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) cases on  a loan-by-loan basis. For prior mortgage arrears they were unable to supply such  data, but confirmed as per previous transactions that they do not accept  borrowers with prior mortgage arrears. Given this, Fitch did not make any  adjustments on account of the missing data.   Missing Income Data For around 2.3% of the portfolio, Santander was unable to provide borrower  income data or the income data provided was for less than GBP10,000 per borrower  For these cases, Fitch conservatively assumes an annual income of GBP1000, which  places these loans in the Class 7 debt-to-income (DTI) band, which is the  highest. This led to a relative increase in the default probabilities for these  loans.  Fast-Track Loans Sixteen per cent of the loans by current aggregate balance are fast-track loans  - all income has been verified for such borrowers. Santander supplied historical  arrears performance data that shows the performance of fast-track loans to be  commensurate with that of fully verified loans. Fitch has therefore not made any  adjustments to the default probabilities on account of the fast-track loans in  the portfolio.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Material increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted  receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case  expectations, which in turn may result in rating actions on the notes. Fitch's  analysis revealed that a 30% increase in the weighted average foreclosure  frequency along with a 30% decrease in the weighted average recovery rate would  not affect the class A notes' 'AAA(EXP)sf' rating. More detailed model implied ratings sensitivity can be found in the presale  report, which is available at www.fitchratings.com. Santander provided Fitch with a loan-by-loan data template; however, a number of  key data fields were missing or partially completed. The agency has not received  loan-level data in respect of prior mortgage arrears; for these loans, the  agency reviewed the historical underwriting criteria in respect of A&L/  Santander's acceptance of applications with prior adverse credit histories.  The agency also did not receive data for property construction year and the  builders deposit indicator. Fitch made an assumption that 10% of loans were new  build properties that had benefited from a builders deposit and applied a 5%  haircut to the valuations of these loans. It is Fitch's opinion that where data was supplied for analysis, it was of  adequate quality. We will review the results of an agreed-upon procedures report  (AUP) conducted on the portfolio prior to the transaction closing. Reviews of  AUP reports from previous Fosse issuances have contained no material errors  which would affect Fitch's ratings analysis. To analyse credit enhancement, Fitch evaluated the collateral using its default  model ResiEMEA. The agency assessed the transaction cash flows using default and  loss severity assumptions under various structural stresses including prepayment  speeds and interest rate scenarios. The cash flow tests showed that each class  of notes could withstand loan losses at a level corresponding to the related  stress scenario without incurring any principal loss or interest shortfall and  can retire principal by the legal final maturity.
