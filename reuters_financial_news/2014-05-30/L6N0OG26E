JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Reuters) - African Bank Investments does not expect dramatically higher funding costs after Moody's cut its foreign debt rating to "junk" status, the chief executive of the South African lender said on Friday.

"The overall cost of funding for the bank will not change significantly, just because new funding over the next few months will be slightly more expensive," Leon Kirkinis said in a statement.
