May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Regulatory approval by the EU Competition Commission of  Hutchison Whampoa's O2 Ireland acquisition boosts the chances of Telefonica <TEF.MC> getting a green light for its acquisition of E-Plus in Germany and could open  the door for consolidation in Spain, Fitch Ratings says. A condition of the  approval is that Hutchison must provide network capacity to two Irish mobile  virtual network operators (MVNOs), but we do not expect this to have the same  disruptive impact that MVNOs have had in some other European markets. The Competition Commission's approval follows a similar decision to allow  Hutchison to buy Orange's operations in Austria, and indicates a gradual  softening of European opposition to telecom consolidation. This could allow  Telefonica's much larger proposed acquisition of KPN's German E-Plus arm to  proceed. But there are significant differences so that approval is not certain.  In particular the German market is much bigger than Ireland's or Austria's,  which could lead the regulator to decide that the country can support four major  operators. If the German deal is approved it will be positive for the credit profile of  both companies. Telefonica will benefit from a significantly stronger operating  profile, while KPN will receive EUR5bn in cash and a stake in the enlarged  German Telefonica business.  Approval could also open the door to consolidation in other markets such as  Spain and Italy.  TeliaSonera has previously considered selling its Spanish  Yoigo mobile operations, but shelved these plans and concentrated on building  its market share, helping to drive fierce price competition in the process. It  is possible a successful German deal could make TeliaSonera look again at  selling the business, which would be positive for all Spanish operators if it  reduced damaging price competition.  Irish Market The Hutchison/O2 Ireland deal should reduce competitive pressures by cutting the  number of operators from four to three and transforming Hutchison's Three arm  from a disruptive challenger to a business with a leading position in a market  where competition is more evenly balanced. While Hutchison must provide 30% network capacity to two MVNOs, we do not  believe a new MVNO entrant has the potential or motivation to disrupt the market  as much as Hutchison's Three did in the past. The most likely partner for this  capacity is Liberty Global's UPC arm, because it already has an established  cable business in Ireland and piggy-backing on the Hutchison/O2 network as an  MVNO would enable it to offer a combination of TV, fixed-line, broadband and  mobile services. While UPC's mobile strategy is at an early stage, it has not so far taken an  aggressive approach to launching similar "quad-play" services in other markets  and has tended to avoid aggressive, price-based competition to build up its  customer base.
