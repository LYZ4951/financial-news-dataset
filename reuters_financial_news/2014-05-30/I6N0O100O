ROME, May 30 (Reuters) - Talks between Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, UniCredit <CRDI.MI> and U.S. private equity firm KKR <KKR.N> to pool some problematic loans of the two Italian lenders are at an advanced stage and should conclude in the next few weeks, the Intesa Sanpaolo CEO said on Friday.

"The talks are at an advanced stage, we think we could finalise an agreement in the next few weeks," Carlo Messina said on the sidelines of a Bank of Italy annual assembly.  In April, Italy's top two banks UniCredit signed a deal with KKR to pool some of their problematic loans as the country's lenders seek new ways to grapple with soured debts.[nL6N0NE21N]
