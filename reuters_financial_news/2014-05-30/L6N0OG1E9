ROME, May 30 (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Ignazio Visco warned on Friday that excessively low inflation in the euro zone must be countered with equal firmness as high inflation and said euro strength had contributed to pushing inflation too low.

Visco said the ECB was ready to use unconventional policies if its next projections on June 5 confirm that inflation is expected to remain well below 2 percent over the next two years, out of line with the ECB's definition of price stability. The ECB's main refinancing rate stands at a record low of 0.25 percent and the bank is expected to cut it further at its June 5 meeting. Euro zone inflation stood at just 0.7 percent in April, far below the ECB's 2 percent ceiling, and is expected to remain at the same level in May.
