May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Domos 2011 Compartment Domos 2011- A (Domos 2011-A) and B (Domos 2011-B), as follows: Domos 2011-A Class A1 (ISIN FR0011129154) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Class A2 (ISIN FR0011129188) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable Domos 2011-B Class A (ISIN FR0011129204) affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable The French prime RMBS transactions comprise loans originated and serviced by BNP  Personal Finance, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> (A+/Stable/F1).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Robust Performance The affirmations reflect the strong performance of the underlying assets in both  transactions. As of the latest payment dates, three-month plus arrears decreased  to 0.89% and 0.36% of the current pool balance in Domos 2011-A and B,  respectively, from 0.94% and 0.43% at the time of the last review in September  2013. Cumulative gross defaults were 1.11% (Domos 2011-A) and 0.77% (Domos  2011-B) of the initial asset balance, of which 25.8% and 39.5% has been  recovered in Domos 2011-A and Domos 2011-B, respectively.  Reserve Funds and Note Amortisation The non-amortising fully funded reserve funds, combined with the sequential  amortisation of the notes in both transactions, will assist the further build-up  of credit enhancement (CE) available to the rated tranches. As of the most  recent payment date, the class A notes had CE of 39.3% and 34.2% in Domos 2011-A  and B, respectively. This does not include the 1% of the outstanding note  balance held in the reserve for liquidity purposes.   Loans Secured By a Caution The residential loans securitised in both transactions are either secured by a  first-ranking mortgage (35.4% and 53.1% in Domos 2011-A and B, respectively) or  a caution (64.6% and 46.9% in Domos 2011-A and B, respectively). These  guarantees are provided by specialised guarantors or mutual insurances. In line  with its criteria, Fitch took a more conservative stance in its estimation of  the expected recovery rate on guaranteed loans by giving no credit to the  caution policy. The additional stresses applied as a result had no impact on the  ratings, as reflected in the affirmations.  Commingling Risk The transactions could be exposed to commingling risk in the event of the  default of the collateral servicer, BNP Personal Finance, as it retains cheque  payments for one day before transferring them to a special dedicated account  opened in the name of issuer and held by BNP Paribas. To mitigate the  commingling risk, dynamic commingling reserves have been established of  currently EUR3m in Domos 2011-A and EUR4m in Domos 2011-B.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
