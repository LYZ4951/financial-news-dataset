May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hong Kong-based Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Ltd's [ICBCA.UL] (ICBC Asia) and Macao-based Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited's [ICBAHG.UL] (ICBC Macau) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A' with Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. The affirmation of ICBC Asia's and ICBC Macau's ratings reflect Fitch's view  that both entities remain core subsidiaries of their Chinese parent Industrial &  Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS> (ICBC; A/Stable), and as such, there is an extremely  high probability of support from the parent if required. The agency does not  assign Viability Ratings to the banks as their intrinsic credit strength is  subject to their operation and financial integration with ICBC. ICBC Asia is the largest overseas subsidiary of ICBC by assets (2.4% of total  assets at end 2013) and it contributed 1.3% of the parent's consolidated  operating profit. ICBC Macau is Macao's second-largest bank by assets and the  third-largest overseas subsidiary of ICBC by assets (0.6%) and profit (0.3%).  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMME AND SUPPORT RATINGs The IDRs and Support Ratings of both banks reflect their roles in ICBC's  cross-regional franchise and offshore renminbi business, and strong integration  with ICBC in management, funding and business generation. The IDRs are aligned  with ICBC's, reflecting Fitch's expectation that support from the Chinese  government for ICBC if required would extend to ICBC Asia and ICBC Macau given  their core importance to its parent. The Stable Outlooks are also in line with  the Outlook on ICBC's IDR.  Fitch continues to believe that ICBC remains committed to support ICBC Asia and  ICBC Macau with liquidity and capital to accommodate their further growth. ICBC  Asia is likely to receive additional capital from the parent, in addition to  HKD11.7bn (USD1.5bn) of common equity received in 2011-2012. ICBC also  subscribed to ICBC Macau's existing subordinated debt. Fitch expects additional  issuance of subordinated debt by ICBC Macau.   Capturing financing needs for mainland customers' overseas expansion remains one  of the banks' core businesses. Fitch expects both banks' China-related exposures  to continue to increase in line with this strategy. The mainland customers are  often referred from their Chinese parent, representing a large portion of ICBC  Asia's 20 largest borrowers. ICBC Asia's gross mainland China exposures remained  significant at 64% of total assets at end-2013 (end-2012: 61%), while ICBC  Macau's rose to 38% of assets at end-2013 (end-2012: 34%) as per Fitch's  definition. A material portion of ICBC Asia's loan portfolio and 20% of ICBC  Macau's benefit from guarantees by ICBC.  Both banks' risk appetite and profile are aligned with their parent's through  secondment of management executives, through centralised business, funding and  risk control and by making use of a common core banking system which, among  others, facilitates the group's liquidity management.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMME AND SUPPORT RATINGs ICBC Asia's and ICBC Macau's IDRs and Support Ratings are sensitive to any  changes to ICBC's ratings or its propensity or ability to extend extraordinary  support in a timely manner.   RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT Subordinated notes issued by ICBC Asia are notched down from its IDR (i.e. the  anchor rating) as Fitch expects parental support. Subordinated notes without  non-viability clauses are rated one notch below ICBC Asia's IDR to reflect below  average recovery prospect of the instruments given their subordination to senior  unsecured instruments. Subordinated notes with non-viability clauses are rated  two notches below the IDR as the instruments will be written-down to nil and the  amount (once written-off) will not be restored. Fitch believes the risk of non-performance of the notes is adequately reflected  in the anchor rating and no incremental notching is applied. Ratings on ICBC  Asia's subordinated notes are primarily sensitive to any change in the bank's  IDR.  The rating actions are as follows: ICBC Asia Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'A'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR and ratings on commercial paper programme  affirmed at 'F1'  Support Rating affirmed at '1' Subordinated notes without non-viability clauses affirmed at 'A-' Subordinated notes with non-viability clauses affirmed at 'BBB+'  ICBC Macau Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'A'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'F1'
