FRANKFURT, May 30 (Reuters) - The world's biggest bond fund, Pimco, may be about to end a net outflow of client funds that reached 22 billion euros ($30 billion) in the first quarter, its Chief Executive Douglas Hodge told a German newspaper.

Parent company Allianz <ALVG.DE> this month called upon the California-based asset manager to prove it can stem the outflows after they dented its own earnings. [ID:nL6N0O04BA] "We are already seeing a revival in demand for bonds. That is evident in both the decline of the yield levels and in the money flows into our fund," Hodge told daily newspaper Boersen-Zeitung.  "After the outflows have returned to their historic average, we are now increasingly seeing an inflow of money again."
