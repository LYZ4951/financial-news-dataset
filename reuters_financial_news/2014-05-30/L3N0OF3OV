NEW DELHI, May 30 (Reuters) - DLF Ltd. <DLF.NS>, India's biggest real estate developer, reported a profit in the fourth quarter, helped by a gain from the sale of its Amanresorts luxury hotel chain.

DLF reported a consolidated net profit of 2.20 billion rupees ($37.3 million) in the January-March quarter compared with a loss of 41.9 million rupees in the year-ago quarter.  Revenue in the quarter fell 12 percent to 19.69 billion rupees as the company continues to battle a slowdown in sales of homes in a sluggish economy.
