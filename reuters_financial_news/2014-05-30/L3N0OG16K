SEOUL, May 30 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> edged lower against the dollar after midday on Friday, as market participants suspected another round of dollar-buying intervention by foreign exchange authorities aimed to curb the won's swift appreciation.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,020.7 as of 0452 GMT, nearly flat from Thursday's onshore close at 1,020.6. The local currency was trading around 1,019 prior to the suspected intervention.
