OSLO, May 30 (Reuters) - Norwegian software maker Cxense has put on hold its planned initial public offering after poor investor response to a book building that ended on May 28, the company said on Friday, making it the latest victim of an increasingly weary market.

"The response hasn't been as we had hoped for. I doubt this is specific to Cxense. I think there are many factors and it's been rough, with many IPOs lately," the company's investor relations head, Staale Bjoernstad, told Reuters. After a recent rush of new listings across Europe, the mood of investors has changed and some have been pulled from the market. [ID:nL6N0OE4UP] "The application to list remains valid until July 4. If we don't do it by then we'll consider other alternatives. Given the somewhat tired IPO market we'll have to consider it week by week," Bjoernstad said.
