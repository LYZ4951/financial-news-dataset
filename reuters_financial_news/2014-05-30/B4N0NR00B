MUNICH, May 30 (Reuters) - German conglomerate <SIEGn.DE> confirmed on Friday that some 11,600 jobs would be affected by a restructuring unveiled by Chief Executive Joe Kaeser earlier this month, but said not all of these positions would necessarily be cut.

In an emailed statement, a Siemens spokesman acknowledged that Kaeser had made clear at a conference in New York on Thursday that the end of the company's sector-based structure would affect 7,600 jobs worldwide. An additional 4,000 would be affected by the abolition of country clusters.
