MUMBAI, May 30 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Friday to mark their first weekly fall in four, as blue-chips such as State Bank of India <SBI.NS> declined after foreign investors sold shares for a fourth consecutive session, while caution was also seen ahead of GDP data and the central bank's policy review.

State Bank of India fell 2.7 percent while ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> fell 2 percent.
