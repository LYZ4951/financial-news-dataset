MILAN, May 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's biggest bank Unicredit <CRDI.MI> opened lower on Friday after Moody's cut its outlook on the lender to negative from stable.

Late on Thursday Moody's said it had changed the outlooks to negative on 82 long-term European bank ratings.[nMDY6kG9kS] The move followed the adoption of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism regulation in the EU, with Moody's saying the balance of risk for banks' senior unsecured creditors had shifted to the downside.
