May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

In its latest Covered Bonds Surveillance Snapshot, Fitch  Ratings reveals that covered bonds ratings could withstand a downgrade of their  issuer by two notches on average. The cushion against downgrades of Issuer  Default Ratings (IDR) increased by one notch following the implementation of  Fitch's updated covered bonds criteria on 10 March 2014, which recognises the  privileged position of covered bonds under bank resolution regimes. At the same  time, the proportion of IDRs on Negative Outlooks has increased among issuers of  covered bonds rated by Fitch, to 42% from 16% earlier this year, due to  weakening state support. The reduced sensitivity of covered bonds ratings to potential IDR downgrades is  a direct consequence of the assignment of IDR uplifts to programmes where  covered bonds are exempt from bail in, and where Fitch considers the likelihood  of an enforcement of the security against the cover pool in the event of a bank  default has reduced. In total, we have incorporated 109 notches of IDR uplifts  into our covered bonds analysis, with 40 programmes benefiting from an IDR  uplift of 2, and 29 programmes benefiting from an IDR uplift of 1. Despite this  larger cushion, the perspective for covered bond ratings has only improved  modestly, with 11 ratings on Positive Outlook, as the potential downgrade of a  support-driven IDR is not always compensated by IDR uplifts. Overall, 27% covered bonds programmes rated by Fitch on the international scale  would be vulnerable to a one-notch downgrade of the corresponding IDR, down from  45% last quarter. Similarly, the number of covered bonds ratings at a risk of  downgrade upon a two or three notch downgrade of the corresponding IDR has  reduced to 13% from 20% and to 8% from 15%, respectively. This sensitivity  analysis is a mechanical application of Fitch's Discontinuity Cap to a lower  IDR, taking into account the IDR uplift and assuming the maximum credit for  recoveries given default under Fitch's criteria. As of 30 April 2014, Fitch rated 132 covered bonds programmes in total, issued  out of 21 countries. Most of them were secured by traditional assets eligible to  covered bonds funding, such as mortgage loans (83%) and public sector debt  (15%). About 59% of the portfolio carried a 'AAA' rating, and less than 5% was  speculative-grade.  Fitch's covered bonds surveillance snapshot presents an overview of all  programmes rated by the agency on the international scale, recaps on recent  rating actions and provides insight on rating steps such as the issuer rating,  the IDR uplift, the D-Cap and the breakeven overcollateralisation for the  rating. It also contains issuance statistics and lists topical covered bonds  research recently published by Fitch as well as reports on criteria applied by  the agency. It is published jointly with an Excel document summarising the key  characteristic and credit metrics for each covered bonds programme.
