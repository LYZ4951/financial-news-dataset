SEOUL, May 30 (Reuters) - The won <KRW=> fell sharply on Friday in a sudden turn after briefly opening higher, with traders suspecting intervention by the South Korean authorities to stem the currency's rise.

The won hit a near six-year high of 1,017.1 per dollar immediately after local trade got underway, but then fell sharply to a low of 1,023.5.
