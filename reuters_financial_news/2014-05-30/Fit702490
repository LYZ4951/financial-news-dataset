May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Hong Kong-based Swire Properties Limited's <1972.HK> (Swire Properties) Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' with Stable Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed Swire Properties' foreign-currency senior unsecured rating, and the ratings on its medium-term note programme and issues from Swire Properties MTN Financing  Limited [SWRAYM.UL] at 'A'. The affirmation reflects the delivery of strong and stable rental income from  Swire Properties' mature investment properties portfolio, which provides strong  gross rental income coverage ratios. The company continued to remain prudent on  expansion in China and demonstrated strong execution in its project in Miami,  USA. Its financial position remains prudent with good liquidity.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Mature Stable Hong Kong Rentals: The gross rental income from the company's  investment properties in Hong Kong has posted 2.9% CAGR since 2009. It reached  HKD8bn in 2013 and has been consistently above HKD7bn in the past five years.  This supports a strong and stable total gross rental income coverage ratio of  5.1-6.2x. Swire Properties has a well-established Grade A office portfolio in  both the central business district and non-central areas (such as East Hong  Kong) in Hong Kong. The diversity of the office portfolio mitigates the risk of  weakening rents due to the sluggish environment for the financial industry.  Commitments to Redevelopment Projects: Swire Properties continues to expand its  Hong Kong investment property portfolio via acquiring or redeveloping old  buildings situated near its current properties. For example, the company has  previously expanded Pacific Place Three via redevelopment of several nearby  sites and it is currently redeveloping the TaiKoo Place techno-centres to Grade  A office space, and turning an industrial site in the southern part of Hong Kong  island to office space. Redevelopment sites carry lower execution risks and  allow Swire Properties to tap resilient demand for office and other commercial  space in existing well-developed areas.  This will gradually strengthen Swire's  leasing income in the long term.  Prudent Expansion in China: Swire Properties has been very prudent in expanding  in Hong Kong and China. In China, it only invests in first-tier cities (for  example, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai) or second-tier cities with very strong  potential (for example, Chengdu and Dalian). Swire also prefers to partner  domestic property developers in Chinese projects. For example, Swire Properties  partnered Gaw Capital Partners  for their , TaiKoo Li Sanlitun Village in  Beijing, China. Since then, Swire Properties has completed two more leasing  projects in China - Taikoo Hui in Guangzhou with Guangzhou Daily and INDIGO in  Beijing with Sino-Ocean.  Expansion in US: Swire Properties aims to deliver high-quality products and  smooth out capex in its development in Miami of Brickell City Centre (BCC), a  project that includes office, residential and hotel components. Phase 1, with  expected attributable GFA of 2.72 million sq ft is targeted to open in 2015  while Phase 2, with 1.3 million sq ft of GFA, is due to open in 2019.  Less Reliance on Parent's Funding: Swire Properties will continue to refinance  its existing intercompany loans from Swire Pacific Limited <0019.HK> with external funding  sources. Borrowings from Swire Pacific have reduced from 74% in end-2011 to 39%  in end-2013. We expect this ratio to drop further in 2015-16. This is neutral  for Swire Properties' credit rating because Fitch expects Swire Properties'  stable rental income streams will support its current credit profile.  Housing Policy Slows Sales: Swire's residential property business is focused on  the luxury segment. In 2013, the Hong Kong government introduced measures to  cool the housing market, which have hit the luxury residential sector the  hardest. Luxury home purchasers in Hong Kong are usually experienced buyers  (that is, not first-home buyers), buyers from mainland China or corporate  purchasers. All these buyers will be affected by either the double-stamp duty or  buyer's stamp duty, or both. Also, the introduction of the buyer's stamp duty  may make it more costly to redevelop old residential buildings. Adequate Interest Coverage: Fitch expects Swire Properties' recurring interest  coverage (investment property EBITDA/gross interest expense) to stay above 4.5x  in the next few years, due to additional leasing income from newly completed  properties.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include - Investment property EBITDA/gross interest expense falling below 4.0x on a  sustained basis - There is an aggressive expansion in China with heightened execution and  financial risk - Material weakening of Swire Pacific's non-property business, which may require  Swire Properties to increase its support to the group
