SINGAPORE, May 30 (Reuters) - Singapore stocks edged down on Friday as investors booked profits ahead of the weekend, with declines spread across the board, while Asian shares flat-lined despite another record closing high in U.S. markets.

The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> fell 0.3 percent to 3291.82, after a strong comeback the previous day, though it gained 0.4 percent on the week. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was flat, deflecting optimism in U.S. markets as the S&P 500 index <.SPX> posted its third record closing high in four sessions. [MKTS/GLOB] Trading among banks dominated the Singapore index, with all three banks among the top traded stock on the bourse by value. OCBC Ltd <OCBC.SI> shares were up 0.2 percent, UOB Ltd <UOBH.SI> shares rose 0.04 percent and DBS Ltd <DBSM.SI> fell 0.4 percent. Singapore Telecommunications Ltd <STEL.SI> retreated from 9-month highs, falling as much as 0.8 percent to S$3.86. Shares of the telecommunication firm had gained as much as 1.6 percent on Thursday after Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd <IPO-ALIB.N> said it was buying a minority stake in Singapore Post Ltd <SPOS.SI>, in which SingTel is the largest shareholder.

Olam shares had shot up 11.8 percent in March to hover at S$2.23, after state investor Temasek Holdings made an offer to buy out Olam, before plunging 4.5 percent after the offer expired on Monday. [ID:nL3N0MB43G] Among small-caps, shares of Tat Hong Holdings Ltd <TAT.SI> plunged 5.3 percent to an intra-day low of S$0.81, after the crane rental company reported quarterly earnings that came in worse than expected.
