May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

U.S. timeshare ABS delinquencies fell this past quarter  and are lower year over year, according to the latest index results from Fitch  Ratings.  Total delinquencies for first quarter-2014 (1Q'14) were 3.19%, down from 3.27%  in 1Q'13 and 3.38% in 4Q'13. This marks seven straight quarters of  year-over-year improvement. Despite these modest improvements, delinquencies  have largely normalized at their historical levels following the dramatic  increases of 2008 and 2009. The quarterly and year-over-year improvement is also evident in default  performance. Defaults for 1Q'14 at 0.65% decreased slightly from 4Q'13 at 0.66%,  and are down from the 0.72% observed a year ago for 1Q'13. While quarterly and  year-over-year improvement is evident, default levels remain somewhat elevated  compared to pre-recessionary levels. On an annualized basis (rolling 12 months), defaults were 7.73% for 1Q'14, down  from 7.93% for 4Q'13. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of  improvement as well as the lowest level of defaults for timeshare ABS in over  four years.  Fitch's Rating Outlook for timeshare ABS remains Stable due in part to the  delevering structures found in timeshare transactions and ample credit  enhancement levels.  Fitch's timeshare ABS index is an aggregation of performance statistics on pools  of securitized timeshare loans originated by various developers. Expected  cumulative gross defaults on underlying transactions can range from 10% to above  20%. While delinquencies and defaults may vary on an absolute basis, most  transactions supporting the index exhibit similar overall trends.  The Fitch timeshare performance index summarizes average monthly delinquency  (over 30 days) and gross default trends tracked in Fitch's database of timeshare  asset backed securities (ABS) dating back to January 1997 and is available on a  quarterly basis.
