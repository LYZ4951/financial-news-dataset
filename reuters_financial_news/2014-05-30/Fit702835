May 30 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Veneto Banca's EUR300m senior unsecured state-guaranteed notes (IT0004807167) a 'BBB+' Long-term rating. The fixed-rate (5%) note was issued in March 2012, with an original maturity of five years.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  The notes' Long-term rating is based on the Republic of Italy's (BBB+/Stable)  direct, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the issue, which covers  payments of both principal and interests. Italy's guarantee was issued by the  Ministry of Economy and Finance under Law Decree 6 December 2011, n.201,  subsequently converted into Law 22 December 2011, n. 214.  The rating reflects Fitch's expectation that Italy will honour the guarantee  provided to the noteholders in a full and timely manner. The state guarantee  ranks pari passu with Italy's other unsecured and unguaranteed senior  obligations. As a result, the notes' Long-term rating is in line with Italy's  'BBB+' Long-term Issuer Default Rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
