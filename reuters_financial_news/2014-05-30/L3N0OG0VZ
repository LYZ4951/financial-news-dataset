SEOUL, May 30 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> closed little changed on Friday, as two rounds of suspected dollar-purchasing intervention by local foreign exchange authorities offset robust month-end demand by exporters.

Interventions by local authorities were spotted at market opening and past midday when the won strengthened above the 1,020 level.[ID:nL3N0OF1UZ][ID:nL3N0OG16K] The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,020.1 versus the dollar at the end of onshore trade, compared with Thursday's close at 1,020.6. On a monthly basis, the won strengthened 1.3 percent, logging its third consecutive month of gains. Meanwhile, local stocks fell in a broad sell-off with the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.9 percent at 1,994.96 points. The index rose 1.7 percent for the month.
