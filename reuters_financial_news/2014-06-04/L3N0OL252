MUMBAI, June 4 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Wednesday, retreating from their record closing highs in the previous session as exporters including IT companies such as Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> dropped amid concerns about the impact of a stronger rupee.

Exporters were among the top decliners in the rally in anticipation of Narendra Modi's victory in general elections last month, as investors preferred domestic-oriented stocks that would benefit from a revival in the economy. Investors expect some consolidation ahead of the new government's budget, due to be unveiled by early or mid-July.  "After such a great rally, profit-booking is a must in the short term. But India is still in a sweet spot. Expect lot of triggers from the government," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of research and fund advisory company Equinomics. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> fell 0.21 percent, or 52.76 points, to end at 24,805.83, retreating from its record closing high hit on Tuesday. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> dropped 0.18 percent, or 13.60 points, to end at 7,402.25, just managing to close above the psychologically important 7,400 level. Software stocks fell on continued concerns about the stronger rupee <INR=D2>. The local currency has gained around 4 percent so far this year and is among the best performers among the Asian currencies tracked by Reuters.  Tata Consultancy Services fell 1.9 percent, Infosys <INFY.NS> ended lower 1.1 percent and HCL Technologies <HCLT.NS> lost 3 percent. Among pharmaceutical exporters, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries <SUN.NS> fell 1.2 percent while Dr.Reddy's Laboratories <REDY.NS> lost 0.8 percent. Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> fell 1.6 percent after JP Morgan downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight", saying share prices already reflect positive catalysts even as fundamentals remain on "a solid footing". [ID:nI8N0NZ00O] Bharti Airtel <BRTI.NS> fell 1.8 percent, adding to Tuesday's 0.4 percent decline on profit-taking after surging 5.1 percent on Monday. However, among stocks that gained, fertiliser companies surged on hopes that the new government will soon clear its 2013/14 outstanding subsidy payments for the sector, dealers said.
