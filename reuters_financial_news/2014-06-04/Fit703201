June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AAA' rating to $579 million in Texas Public Finance Authority state of Texas general obligation (GO) refunding bonds, consisting of: --$283,740,000 GO refunding bonds, series 2014A; --$295,400,000 GO refunding bonds, taxable series 2014B. The par amounts are subject to change prior to final sale. The refunding bonds  are expected to sell via negotiated sale on June 24, 2014.  In addition, Fitch affirms the rating on approximately $14.5 billion in state GO  bonds at 'AAA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  SECURITY The bonds are general obligations to which the state pledges its full faith and  credit.  KEY RATING DRIVERS LOW DEBT: The state's debt burden is low but has risen due to significant  growth-related capital needs, especially for transportation. Amounts for debt  service are constitutionally dedicated.   GROWTH-ORIENTED ECONOMY: The state's economy is large, diverse, and is growing  rapidly relative to national averages. The state's energy industry remains a  significant source of economic activity and is subject to volatility.   SIGNIFICANT RESERVE BALANCES: Financial operations are generally conservative.  The state has built a sizable budget reserve, with a portion of natural resource  receipts dedicated to funding it.  SALES TAX DEPENDENCE: Finances are dependent on consumption-based (primarily  sales) taxes, and volatile energy taxes are also important.  GROWTH-RELATED SPENDING PRESSURES: Longer-term fiscal pressures stem from having  to adequately fund the state's rapid growth. This includes expanded  transportation needs, school funding, and water needs.  RATING SENSITIVITIES ECONOMIC GROWTH AND HIGH RESERVES: The state's GO rating and Stable Outlook  assume the maintenance of high reserve balances and continued economic growth.  The rating could be pressured in the event of severe revenue weakness, including  stemming from cyclicality in the state's large energy sector, or unwillingness  to address potential fiscal challenges in an effective and timely manner.  CREDIT PROFILE The state's long-term 'AAA' GO rating reflects its low debt burden, conservative  financial operations and a growth-oriented economy that continues to outpace  national averages. Financial pressures arise from the demand that rapid growth  places on the state's consumption-based tax system, including longer-term  transportation needs and the state's commitment to education. Texas' GO bonds are payable from a constitutional appropriation out of the first  moneys coming into the state treasury not otherwise appropriated. This  unrestricted balance equaled $45 billion as of Aug. 31, 2013, the fiscal  year-end.  The TPFA issues state GO bonds, CP notes and lease obligations and revenue bonds  on behalf of multiple state agencies and higher education institutions, subject  to state legislative authorization. As of Aug. 31, 2013, the TPFA had  approximately $2 billion in outstanding GO bonds, including $343 million issued  for the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), a state  research institution for which $3 billion in GO bonds were authorized by voters.  Proceeds of both refunding series are intended to refinance outstanding CP  notes, with the series 2014B proceeds intended to refinance CP authorized for  CPRIT.  DEBT AND OTHER LIABILITIES Texas' net tax-supported debt burden is low, with approximately $14.7 billion as  of Aug. 31, 2013 equal to 1.3% of 2013 personal income. This figure includes  $10.6 billion in GO bonds supported by tax revenues of the general revenue fund  or the mobility fund, and $3.8 billion in state highway fund bonds to which  constitutionally-dedicated transportation receipts are pledged. Net  tax-supported debt has risen with issuance over the last decade for  transportation needs but remains low measured against personal income.  Funded ratios for the state's two major pension systems have declined given  investment losses in the last downturn, and annual contributions have been  consistently below actuarially calculated levels. As of Aug. 31, 2013, the  reported funded ratio for the state employees' system was 79.6%. The teachers'  system funded ratio was 80.8%. Using Fitch's more conservative 7% discount rate  (compared to each system's 8% discount rate assumption) would lower the funded  ratio to 71.7% for the employees' system and 72.8% for the teachers' system.  Texas' net tax supported debt and unfunded pensions together equal about 6.1% of  personal income, in line with the median for U.S. states. The 2013 state legislature increased employer contributions for the employees'  system, although contributions remain below the level needed to amortize the  liability in 30 years. The legislature also adopted teacher plan reforms,  including a higher retirement age and phased increases in member, state and  district contribution rates. The state reports the teacher system liability as a  state obligation.  FINANCES Finances are generally conservatively managed, though challenges include  sustainably addressing long-term growth needs and managing the cyclicality  inherent in the state's energy-dominated economy. The state maintains fiscal  flexibility both in the form of its rainy day reserve (the economic  stabilization fund [ESF]), as well as in its demonstrated willingness to make  deep spending cuts to maintain budget balance. The ESF benefits from the  constitutional dedication of a share of oil and gas production taxes, as well as  unencumbered balances at fiscal year-end; the ESF balance as of April 30, 2014  was $6.7 billion, equal to 13.6% of estimated fiscal 2014 general revenues. Actual revenues during the fiscal 2012-2013 biennium performed consistently  stronger than assumed at budget adoption, in spring 2011, with the state raising  its forecast accordingly. The comptroller's December 2013 revenue certification  reported fiscal 2012-2013 biennium all funds tax revenues rising 23.8% from the  previous biennium (compared to the 7.2% assumed in the adopted budget forecast  two years earlier). With stronger revenue performance, the legislature in its  spring 2013 session supplemented fiscal 2013 spending, including addressing  several unmet needs remaining from the previous legislature, such as the  underfunding of Medicaid and a school payment deferral in August 2013, the final  month of the biennium. The latter was addressed as part of a $1.9 billion draw  from the ESF.  The December 2013 revenue forecast for the fiscal 2014-2015 biennium assumes all  funds tax collections rising a modest 7.5% from the 2012-2013 biennium, to  nearly $98.8 billion; total all funds revenues likewise are projected to rise  7.5%, to $208.2 billion. All funds appropriations in the fiscal 2014-2015 budget  total $200.4 billion, about 5.1% ahead of fiscal 2012-2013 biennium  expenditures. Among other changes the adopted budget included significant  spending increases for schools, pay raises for state employees, and the higher  pension contributions noted earlier. Despite higher school funding, litigation  regarding the constitutionality of school funding continues. With a rapidly growing ESF balance from strong energy tax performance, the  adopted budget provided for the diversion of ESF resources for other state  needs. In addition to the $1.9 billion draw in ESF balances noted earlier for  fiscal 2013 budget needs, the legislature established a $2 billion revolving  fund for water-related projects, a perennial need in the state given its high  growth and scarce water resources; voters authorized the new fund in November  2013.  Additionally, a proposed constitutional amendment diverting half of future  incremental oil and gas taxes dedicated to the ESF to instead support highway  funding will be put before voters in November 2014. Based on the statutory  formula effective if voters approve the measure, the ESF balance after all  recent changes is forecast to be $8.7 billion as of Aug. 31, 2015, equal to 9.1%  of fiscal 2014-2015 biennium general revenue fund tax receipts. In Fitch's view,  the ESF balance remains adequate despite the diversions authorized by the last  legislature. Actual revenue performance in the current biennium remains solid, with total  year-to-date general revenues through April rising 7.8% from a year earlier, and  sales tax revenues rising 5%.  ECONOMY The state's economy has expanded rapidly and diversified over the last two  decades, although the cyclical energy sector still represents a large share of  economic activity. Population growth is very rapid, rising nearly 27% since 2000  (compared to 12.3% nationally). The state outperformed the nation into the last  downturn given growth-related momentum and strong energy sector performance in  2007 and 2008, and has continued to outpace the nation since the recovery  started.  Employment in 2012 and 2013 in Texas rose 2.9% in both years, compared to the  1.7% gains in both years reported nationally. April 2014 employment rose 3.2%  year-over-year, compared to a 1.7% gain nationally. Growth remains particularly  strong in oil and gas-related sectors, although services are also rapidly  gaining. The unemployment rate, at 5.2% in April 2014, is well below the 6.3%  rate reported nationally. Personal income has shown strong growth in recent  quarters, rising 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 1.4%  nationally. Personal income per capita measured 98% of the nation's in 2013,  ranking 25th among the states.
