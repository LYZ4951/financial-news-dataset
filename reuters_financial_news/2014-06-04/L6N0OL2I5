DUBAI, June 4 (Reuters) - Bahraini sovereign fund Mumtalakat [BHMUT.UL] swung back into profit in 2013 because of an improved performance at Gulf Air and lower impairment losses, it said on Wednesday.

The fund, fully owned by the Bahraini state but run on a commercial basis, made a net profit of 82.7 million dinars ($219 million) in 2013 compared with a net loss of 181.7 million dinars in the previous year, a statement to Reuters said.
