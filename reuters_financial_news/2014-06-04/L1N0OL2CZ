June 4 (Reuters) - Dave & Buster's Inc has revived plans for an initial public offering after negotiations on an outright sale of the restaurant and arcade chain failed to lead to a deal, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Dave & Buster's initially tried to go public in 2012 but scrapped those plans due to market conditions. Reuters reported in December the company was working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> and Jefferies Group LLC to explore both an IPO and an outright sale at a valuation of more than $1 billion. [ID:nL2N0JS0MS] Talks in recent months between Dave & Buster's owner, Oak Hill Capital Partners, and several interested parties, including a consortium of Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp <OCX.TO> and movie theater operator Cineplex Inc <CGX.TO>, as well as Chuck E. Cheese's owner Apollo Global Management LLC <APO.N>, did not result in any deal, the people said this week. The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. Representatives of Dave & Busters, Oak Hill, Onex, Cineplex and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Founded in 1982, Dave & Buster's is an owner and operator of 69 venues that offer entertainment for adults and families such as sports-oriented, video and simulation games. The venues also serve food and beverages. Oak Hill acquired the Dallas-based company for $570 million in May 2010. Dave & Buster's is the latest in a string of restaurant chains that have been trying to sell themselves or go public as market valuations for the sector continue to rise. Last month, Darden Restaurant Inc <DRI.N> agreed to sell its Red Lobster seafood chain to private equity firm Golden Gate Capital LLC for $2.1 billion. [ID:nL3N0O23GL] Carlson Restaurants Inc also agreed to sell its casual dining chain TGI Fridays to private equity firms Sentinel Capital Partners and TriArtisan Capital Partners in May for more than $800 million.
