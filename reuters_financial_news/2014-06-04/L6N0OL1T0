CAIRO, June 4 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound strengthened slightly at a central bank dollar sale on Wednesday and stayed unchanged on the black market, days after Egypt elected former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as its new president.

It was the first time since April 10 that the bank allowed the pound to strengthen, albeit only marginally. Sisi, who toppled Egypt's first freely elected leader last July following mass protests, took more than 90 percent of the vote and joins a long line of leaders drawn from the military. The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1403 pounds <CBEO> compared with 7.1404 pounds at its last sale on Monday. It had offered $40 million. Forex traders and economists have described the central bank's decision to allow the pound to gradually weaken since March as a managed depreciation. The central bank has not said why it has been letting the currency weaken. Businessmen have cited clarity on the direction of the currency as a condition for further investment.  The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars <EGP=> are determined by the results of the central bank sales <EGYTV>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.
