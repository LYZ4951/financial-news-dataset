June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its criteria assumptions for assessing credit risk in French residential mortgage loan pools. The updated assumptions do not have any impact on the existing French RMBS and covered bond ratings. The assumptions factor in the credit strength of the sovereign as well as the  fairly stable performance of the residential loans. They also reflect Fitch's  macro-economic expectations. Following broadly stagnant GDP growth in 2013,  Fitch expects growth to accelerate in 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, the agency  expects unemployment to stabilise in 2014. As such and considering the stable  underwriting framework and characteristics of the French housing loans, the  current economic outlook in France does not warrant any material changes to  rating assumptions. Fitch's overall base lifetime foreclosure frequency (FF) for a standard retail  French loan for France is 3.9%, unchanged since 2013. This base FF is applicable  to an "average" retail residential loan in terms of risk profile. Due to the  heterogeneity of the French market and the underlying differences between  lenders, the agency adjusts the base FF on a case-by-case basis to take into  account the characteristics of each lender and, in some cases, the loan security  type (mortgage versus the so-called "cautions", i.e. guarantee). Fitch's 'Bsf' peak-to-trough house price decline (HPD) assumption has remained  unchanged at 13%. Therefore, to reflect the change in property prices over the  past 12 months, Fitch's current-to-trough HPD assumptions have slightly been  increased in 2014 (for example to 11% at 'Bsf' from 10%), with the exception of  the 'AAAsf' scenario, resulting in a slight increase in Fitch's MVD assumption.  The 'Bsf' market value decline (MVD) increased to 38% from 37% in 2013 while the  'AAAsf' MVD has remained stable.  High voluntary prepayment assumptions were reduced in light of available  historical prepayment data, as provided by French mortgage lenders and seen in  French RMBS transactions. The agency views such revised stresses as providing a  sufficient cushion when compared with the historical prepayment levels as well  as those expected to be reached. The updated criteria assumptions will be used for rating new and existing RMBS  transactions and covered bond programmes. The MVD assumptions will also be used  for SME CLOs secured by residential real estate.
