STOCKHOLM, June 4 (Reuters) - Sweden's financial system is stable, but more measures are needed to reduce risks associated with household debt and the banking system, the Swedish central bank said in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Report.

As a measure to deal with high levels of household debt, the central bank said that Sweden should introduce tighter standards for banks to use when they calculate the affordability of individual mortgages. "If it proves to be the case that the rate of increase in housing prices and household debt continues to accelerate, it will become even more urgent to consider additional measures to slow down the build-up of risk," the central bank said. The Riksbank also said countercyclical capital buffers for banks should be set at 2.5 percent, higher than the 1 percent proposed by the FSA.
