KAMPALA, June 4 (Reuters) - Uganda plans to end a state pension monopoly and make civil servants contribute to their retirement funds in order to improve funding and mobilise more long-term capital for the economy, a senior official said.

East Africa's third-largest economy has posted solid growth based on expanding private business and foreign capital inflows. But businesses often complain about the cost of capital while banks mostly rely on short-term deposits for lending. Existing rules mean private companies have to make their employee contributions to the state's National Social Security Fund, while state workers make no contributions, creating a potential funding crisis for future generations. "There's inadequate money in Uganda's banking industry that can be lent out on long-term, and that has meant that interest rates on long-term investments have remained high," said Moses Bekabye, chief executive officer at Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority (URBRA), the agency spearheading reforms. "Through these reforms we'll increase the quantity of long-term savings in the economy that can be used to finance long-term investments at a cheaper cost," he said in an interview on Tuesday. Changes to the law were being reviewed by parliament and could be in place by the end of 2014, he said. Under a 1985 law, private firms with more than five workers contribute the equivalent of 15 percent of each employee's salary to the NSSF, which pays a lump sum pension on retirement. The employer contributes 10 percent and employees pay 5 percent. State workers have a non-contributory government scheme.  The new law will remove the five-worker threshold so even firms with one employee will make contributions, although they will be allowed to use other regulated pension providers. State employees will also start contributing towards their own pensions and will be allowed to choose their own provider. Bekabye said other changes in the proposed law would include strengthening oversight of pension fund managers and expanding pensions coverage in the country of 36 million people whose economy is expected to grow by about 6 percent in 2014/15. URBRA estimates Uganda has a workforce of about 14 million people, only 5 percent of whom are covered by existing pensions schemes. The regulator has projected that reforms outlined in the law could create a pool of pension savings from contributions worth about 16.7 trillion Ugandan shillings ($6.55 billion) in the next 10 years. "And that excludes the return on these funds. If you apply at least 15 percent compound interest you realise the potential of Uganda's pensions sector is extremely huge," Bekabye said."If these savings come in they will increase the capital available for investment and job creation," he said, adding new providers would compete for investments with higher returns.
