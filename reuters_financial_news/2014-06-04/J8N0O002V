KAMPALA, June 4 (Reuters) - Uganda's central bank cut its key lending rate <UGCBIR=ECI> by 50 basis points to 11 percent on Wednesday, citing a lower inflation rate and concerns about sluggish growth.

Bank of Uganda (BoU) Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said political instability in some of Uganda's trading partners, a reference to neighbouring South Sudan, and a weak agriculture sector were the biggest downside risks to the economy. Tumusiime-Mutebile also told a news conference he expected headline inflation to be 6 to 7 percent in 2014/2015. Uganda's statistics office had said on Monday that inflation slowed to 5.4 percent in the year to May from 6.7 percent in April.
