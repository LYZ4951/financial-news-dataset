SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares slipped 0.4 percent on Wednesday to a near 2-week low, driven by losses across the financial sector and a drop among miners as iron ore prices continued to fall - although upbeat GDP numbers helped lift the market from session lows.

Australia's gross domestic product was 3.5 percent higher in the first quarter than the year before, a marked pick-up from the 2013 trough of 2.1 percent as booming resource exports and spending by households helped offset a big drag from inventories, lifting the benchmark from session lows of 5,455.0. The 'Big Four' banks all fell, with top lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> fell 0.6 percent, while third-largest lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> dropped 0.7 percent as it traded ex-dividend.  "My view in the market is that things have run up very high and people are taking some money off the top", said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.  "The period of instability is still in people's minds, there are signs of improvement here and there, but not enough in reference particularly to the labour market." The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> lost 21.5 points to 5,458.2 by 0201 GMT, to a near two-week low. The benchmark fell 0.7 percent on Tuesday. Housing sector stocks buoyed the broader market, with Stockland Corp Ltd <SGP.AX> gaining 1.8 percent to its highest since November, at A$4.02.  Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX> shares bounced 5.9 percent to A$4.56, a near six-year high, after the company said it received a A$2.6 billion takeover offer from Singapore real estate firm Frasers Centrepoint Ltd <FRCT.SI>, narrowly trumping a bid by Stockland.
