June 4 (Reuters) - Britain's Workspace Group Plc <WKP.L> reported a 43 percent jump in full-year net asset value as the landlord saw an increase in occupancy and charged higher rates in a recovering commercial property market.

The real estate investment trust, which provides office spaces to small businesses, said EPRA net asset value - a key measure of industry performance - rose to 496 pence per share in the year to March 31 from 348 pence a year earlier. [ID:nRSD7703Ia] EPRA (European Public Real Estate Association) net asset value excludes market adjustments of effective cash flow hedges, deferred tax relating to revaluation movements and capital allowances and derivatives. Last year, growth in the UK commercial property business  climbed to its highest level since 2010, with income returns from commercial assets rising to 6.8 percent, data from real estate benchmark provider Investment Property Databank Ltd showed.

The company charged like-for-like rent per square foot of 15.28 pounds, up 8.5 percent from a year earlier.
