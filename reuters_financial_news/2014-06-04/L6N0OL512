LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - The Bank of England's risk watchdog will consider the country as a whole and not just London when it considers possible intervention in the property market later this month, a BoE policymaker said on Wednesday.

The Bank's Financial Policy Committee meets on June 17 and the surging property market will be on the agenda as some economists say there is already a bubble in London.
