OSLO, June 4 (Reuters) - Norway's DNB <DNB.OL> bank must hold 30-40 percent more equity than competitors in neighbouring Sweden because of different rules for calculating core capital, Chief Financial Officer Bjoern Erik Naess said on Wednesday.

Both countries are implementing stricter bank rules but use different methods to calculate risk weighted equity ratios. "Our equity capital today ammounts to 140 billion Norwegian crowns ($23.30 billion). If we had been under the Swedish regime we could have had 30-40 percent less equity," Naess told Reuters on the sidelines of a banking conference. "Comparable risks are getting lower weights in Sweden," he added. Naess said that stricter rules in the wake of Europe's financial crisis had been good for the continent's banks but Norway should have similar regulations to other countries. "There are a lot deviations in the Norwegian banking regulations which are affecting the competitiveness of Norwegian banks and financial services," Naess said. In its latest move to boost liquidity in the sector, Norway named DNB, Kommunalbanken and Nordea's <NDA.ST> local unit as systemically important, requiring them to hold an additional two percentage points in capital.  Naess said the strict Norwegian rules carried a cost both for mortgage borrowers and businesses alike. Banking lobby Finance Norway said it was hoping Nordic authorities would eventually harmonise regulations. "I think it's sad that Norwegian bank (shares) are priced so low compared with Swedish banks. I think the reason is the regulatory issues," Finance Norway Chairman Finn Haugan said. Haugan is also chief executive of regional bank Sparebank 1 SMN <MING.OL>.
