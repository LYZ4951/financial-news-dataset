SINGAPORE, June 4 (Reuters) - Singapore shares eased on Wednesday after a survey showing the city-state's manufacturing activity grew in May but at a slower pace than in the previous month, took a toll on investor appetite, while commodities and property stocks declined on profit booking.

The Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management's Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.8 from April's 51.1. The previous month's figure was the highest since October. [ID:nS7N0MN00G] "The market has been trading sideways for a while, with not many fresh catalysts," said OCBC investment analyst Carey Wong. "Manufacturing numbers aren't very strong either." The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> slipped 0.5 percent to 3,280.35. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was down 0.3 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] The Singapore index was also weighed down by losses in real estate and diversified industrials stocks, with both sectors declining 0.15 percent and 0.18 percent respectively. Frasers Centrepoint Ltd <FRCT.SI> fell as much as 4.2 percent after the real estate company made a surprise A$2.6 billion ($2.41 billion) cash takeover bid for Australia's Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX>. [ID:nL3N0OK4Y5] Australand shares, however, soared as much as 7 percent to their six-year high after the deal was announced. Ascendas REIT <AEMN.SI>, the newest entrant to the index, was the top traded stock on the Singapore index by value. The stock fell as much as 3.3 percent, extending losses into a fourth day.
