FRANKFURT, June 4 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> delayed by at least one day plans to price around 6.3 billion euros ($8.6 billion) in new shares as part of a capital increase, market participants said.

The rights issue forms the lion's share of an 8 billion euro ($11 billion) capital hike announced by the bank in mid-May to strengthen its capital base and to see through a costly restructuring. "It's a technical issue. It has nothing to do with demand," said one market participant.
