June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

This announcement replaces the version published earlier on 4 June 2014 to remove the senior secured rating, which Fitch Ratings has not assigned to the issuer. Fitch Ratings has affirmed Pacnet Limited's [PCNTIP.UL] (Pacnet) Long-Term Foreign-Currency  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B'. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed the  company's USD350m guaranteed senior secured notes due 2018 at 'BB/RR1'. The  Outlook is Stable. The telecoms network and IT infrastructure company has dual  headquarters in Hong Kong and Singapore.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Smaller Scale, Intense Competition: The ratings reflect low profitability,  strong competition from better-capitalised market participants, a weak financial  position, and the high execution risk of its data centre strategy. The company  competes with large telecoms incumbents in its primary service offerings such as  managed data connectivity solutions. Pacnet's data centre operations are also  smaller than those of its rivals in key markets. Limited Data Centre Contribution: To date, contribution from its core data  centres - those that are built, owned and operated by Pacnet rather than  reselling of facilities - has been limited. We expect further improvement in  EBITDA will be slow in the next few quarters, and a more meaningful contribution  from core data centres is likely to come in 2015. The successful rollout and  rapid take-up of its new data centre capacity are important to Pacnet's  long-term strategy and could drive improvement in credit metrics. High Leverage: Fitch expects Pacnet's free cash flow to remain negative for at  least the next 12-18 months, and funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net  leverage to be at around 4x (2013: 3.6x) and cash flow from operations  (CFO)-adjusted net leverage to remain at over 5x (2013: 5.3x) for the next 12-18  months. However, both maintenance capex and committed capex are low, and  therefore the company has some flexibility to manage its cash requirements  should internal funds need to be retained - as the company has demonstrated in  the past. High Recovery Rating: The 'RR1' Recovery Rating on the outstanding USD350m  guaranteed notes reflects Fitch's recovery calculation for the proposed notes of  at least 90%, and the bonds are therefore rated three notches higher than the  IDR under our recovery rating methodology. The notes are subordinated to any  future debt raised at non-guarantor subsidiaries. However, Fitch understands  that the company has no plans to raise such funds. Adequate Liquidity: Fitch believes Pacnet's liquidity remains adequate. At  end-2013, unrestricted cash amounted to USD54m. However, there was no major debt  maturing within one year at end-2013, except finance lease obligation of  USD0.1m. The refinancing of USD29m in bank loans by USD50m of new bank loans in  June 2013 and also the refinancing of the previous USD300m senior secured notes  with the USD350m senior secured notes in December 2013 raised the average debt  maturity to over 4 years, from 2.0 years previously.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - FFO-adjusted net leverage rising over 5x - FFO fixed charge coverage falling below 2x (2013: 2.5x), both on a sustained  basis  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - CFO-adjusted net leverage falling below 4x - FFO-adjusted net leverage falling below 4x
