June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in its latest European Leveraged Loan CLO Tracker that CLOs continue to demonstrate stable ratings and strong performance.  The average net loss across all transactions was -1.56% at end-April 2014, up  from -1.49% at end-April 2013. The increase was due to the continued workout of  defaulted or credit risk names. However, one of the most significant drivers of  net portfolio losses in 2014 has been the default of the Vivarte transaction. In the past 12 months, Fitch has rated 11 transactions that have become  effective and which are included in the CLO Tracker data file. A further seven  transactions have closed but have not yet become effective. The average time to  ramp-up was 3.4 months and the average percentage ramped at closing was 66%. CLOs 1.0 rated by Fitch have performed in line with investor expectations, with  an annual average cash return of approximately 14% and an average cumulative  distribution near 90% of the equity balance. 80% of the CLOs 1.0 rated by Fitch  made an equity payment on the most recent payment date, with an average  annualised cash return of more than 17% and a median annualised cash return  above 20%. Fitch notes a high disparity between deals. Amend and extend activity has diminished as refinancing options have become  available through the high yield bond market and on the back of new CLO  issuance. On average, transactions that are one year from the end of their  reinvestment period have paid down their senior liabilities by 10% and 22% after  two years, as seen in Figure 1. CLOs are overweight loans with a Recovery Rating of 'RR3'. They represent 44% of  assets in CLO portfolios, compared to 35% of credit opinions for senior secured  loans. However, covenant-lite (Cov-Lite) loans have increased as part of CLO  portfolios and CLO 2.0 transactions typically now have Cov-Lite buckets ranging  from 20% to 50%. The credit quality of recent vintage Cov-Lite loans has  migrated from 'B' to 'B'/'B-'. This trend shows a growing appetite for risk  among leveraged loan investors The report, European Leveraged Loan CLO Tracker, is available on  www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the link below.
