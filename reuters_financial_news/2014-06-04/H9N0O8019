HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's main stock index slipped from a five-month high on Wednesday, hit by a slumping property sector as investors sold off the shares of developers after recent strong gains.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.6 percent at 23,151.71 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong shed 0.5 percent. Both indexes suffered their biggest declines in almost a month.  Property stocks were some of the heaviest hit following a recent rally in the sector. Henderson Land Development <0012.HK> shed 2.8 percent, while Sun Hung Kai Properties <0016.HK> was off 1.7 percent.  Chinese developers listed in Hong Kong also fell on concerns over a slowdown in China's housing market that could affect sales. China Overseas Land & Investment <0688.HK> and China Resources Land <1109.HK> were down 2.2 and 2.3 percent, respectively. Link Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) <0823.HK> edged up 0.2 percent to close at a one-year high after corporate earnings for the year ended March 31. The company posted a 14 percent growth in distributable income from a year earlier.
