JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest insurer, Sanlam <SLMJ.J>, reported a 23 percent jump in earnings for the first four months of the year on Wednesday after booking increased new business volumes and higher returns from investment services.

The company established nearly a century ago said new business increased 21 percent to 59 billion rand ($5.5 billion) while earnings from financial services improved by 40 percent.  Sanlam said on Tuesday it had concluded an agreement to purchase a 63 percent stake in Soras Group, Rwanda's biggest life and non-life insurer. The $24.3 million purchase is its first foray into the country. Sanlam has businesses in 16 countries including 11 other African countries and has set aside $370 million for emerging market acquisitions this year.
