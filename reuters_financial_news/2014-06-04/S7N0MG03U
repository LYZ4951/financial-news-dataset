BANGALORE, June 4 (Reuters) - Activity in India's huge services industry expanded for the first time in nearly a year in May, driven by a surge in new business, a survey showed on Wednesday.

The HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index <INPMIS=ECI>, compiled by Markit, rose to 50.2 in May from 48.5 in April, the first rise above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since June last year. A landslide win for Narendra Modi and his Bhartiya Janata Party - which created India's first majority government in three decades - has fuelled expectations for key economic reforms after years of policy paralysis. That optimism showed in the new business sub-index, which rose to 50.5 in May, also the highest since last June. The PMI data also showed input costs and prices charged by services companies rose at a slower pace last month. Inflation has eased this year. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan opted to keep the central bank's key repo rate unchanged at 8 percent on Tuesday, as expected, after a series of rate rises. [ID:nI8N0N1010]
