June 4 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1000 GMT on Wednesday:

** Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co <8750.T> has agreed to buy U.S. peer Protective Life Corp <PL.N> for $5.7 billion, the largest acquisition by a Japanese insurer, displaying its determination to grow overseas to counter weak prospects at home. Dai-ichi Life, Japan's second largest private-sector life insurer, said it would issue up to 250 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in new shares to help finance the widely expected purchase of Protective Life.

The sale marks a lucrative exit for private equity group PAI Partners and GECOS - part of Italian retailer GruppoPam - which have jointly owned Nuance since a 2011 buyout that valued the company at 676 million francs. [ID:nL6N0OL0UN]  ** Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> said it raised 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) from a share sale to help fund its long-planned takeover of Swedish truckmaker Scania AB <SCVb.ST>. VW said on Wednesday it had issued 10.47 million new preference shares at 191 euros each in an accelerated book building with institutional investors, a move that confirmed an earlier Reuters report. [ID:nL6N0OL191]  ** Singapore-listed Frasers Centrepoint Ltd <FRCT.SI> made a surprise A$2.6 billion ($2.41 billion) cash takeover bid for Australia's Australand Property Group <ALZ.AX>, trumping an offer from Australian firm Stockland Corp Ltd <SGP.AX>. Backed by Thai beer billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, Frasers Centrepoint made its offer less than a week after Stockland upped its bid to A$2.5 billion, Australand said in a statement on Wednesday. [ID:nL3N0OK4Y5]  ** Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <0013.HK> has resumed talks with Russian telecoms group Vimpelcom Ltd <VIP.O> over merging their Italian mobile firms, encouraged by Hutchison's 3 getting the go-ahead last week for an acquisition in Ireland, according to several people familiar with the situation. [ID:nL6N0OK4UO]  ** The administrators of troubled New Zealand clothing retailer Postie Plus Group Ltd <PPG.NZ> said on Wednesday they had found a likely buyer for the company. The struggling company called in administrators from PricewaterhouseCoopers on Tuesday after its bank refused to back the retail chain, which has been racking up losses and losing market share for the past two years. The stock last traded at 7.3 NZ cents a share, valuing the company at NZ$2.9 million ($2.45 million). [ID:nL3N0OL0T7]  ** French cement maker Lafarge SA <LAFP.PA> will combine its South Africa business with publicly traded Nigerian unit Lafarge Wapco <WAPCO.LG>, listing its Africa interests together on the Lagos bourse, its country chief executive said on Tuesday. Guillaume Roux said the deal, worth $1.35 billion, would see the Lafarge group get $200 million in cash and 1.4 billion new shares in Lafarge Wapco to effect the merger. [ID:nL6N0OK4TM]
