FRANKFURT, June 4 (Reuters) - German public-sector trust RAG foundation is reducing its stake in Evonik <EVKn.DE> with an exchangeable bond that carries a zero percent coupon, a source familiar with the transaction said.

The exchange price of the bond is being set at a 37.5 percent premium above the volume weighted average price, the source said on Wednesday. RAG earlier said that it would issue a bond worth as much as 600 million euros ($680 million) that can be exchanged into about 3 percent of Evonik's share capital. [ID:nL6N0OL224]
