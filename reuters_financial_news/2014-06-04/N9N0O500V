SAO PAULO, June 4 (Reuters) - Activity in Brazil's services sector posted a fourth straight month of meager expansion in May as new orders grew ahead of the World Cup kicking off this month, however, grim business sentiment weighed on the outlook for the rest of the year.

HSBC's Purchasing Managers Index for Brazilian services <BRPMIS=ECI> edged higher on a seasonally adjusted basis to 50.6 in May, from 50.4 in April. A reading above 50 indicates growth. In turn, HSBC's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> for the country, incorporating the weakest manufacturing activity in 10 months, slipped to 49.8 in May from 49.9 in April. The weak results added to evidence of a deepening malaise in Brazil's economy, which barely grew in the first quarter as investment plunged and consumer spending flattened. [ID:nL1N0OG0JC] "The business expectations index fell steeply for the second month in a row ... signalling an increase in downside risk for economic activity in the coming quarters," wrote Andre Loes, Chief Economist for HSBC in Brazil. Business expectations among service providers fell to the lowest level since HSBC began collecting data in March 2007.
