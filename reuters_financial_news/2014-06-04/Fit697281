June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Results from Fitch Ratings' 2Q14 European fixed income investor survey show that European investors fear deflation much more than inflation, despite the gradual economic recovery and the substantial global monetary stimulus since the start of the crisis.  Only 4% of those polled view inflation as a high risk, while 11 times as many  investors - 44% - say deflation remains a more serious threat. This figure was  virtually unchanged from the January survey but more than double the reading in  the poll last October when investors had a "Goldilocks" outlook, viewing neither  inflation nor deflation as high risk factors. These investor views on deflation acknowledge the expected move by the ECB on  Thursday to cut rates and announce new measures to support credit growth. May  inflation data shows eurozone inflation at a lower than expected 0.5%. Fitch's 2Q14 survey was conducted from 2 April to 16 May. It represents the  views of managers of an estimated EUR5.3trn of fixed-income assets. The full survey, including a video highlights summary, is now available on  www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the link below.
