June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its criteria assumptions for assessing credit risk in Belgian residential mortgage loan pools. The updated criteria assumptions do not have any impact on existing Belgian RMBS and covered bond ratings. The assumptions factor in the credit strength of the sovereign (AA/Stable) as  well as the stable performance of the residential loans. It also reflects the  fact that the Belgian economy is recovering. Fitch expects growth to accelerate  in 2014 and 2015 following broadly stagnant GDP growth in 2012 and 2013.  Furthermore, we expect unemployment to stabilise in 2014 and decrease in 2015.  Fitch regards the credit profile of Belgian housing loans as relatively healthy  and backed by a strong underwriting framework. Fitch's rating assumptions have  not materially changed due to the broadly stable outlook for the Belgian economy  and the mortgage and housing market. The main changes relate to the market value decline (MVD) and the prepayment  assumptions. Overall, while property sale prices in Belgium continued to  increase in 2013 (1.8% and 3.1% year-on-year increases for houses and apartments  respectively), the increase was only slightly above inflation (1.2% CPI),  meaning that overall property prices, relative to affordability, have broadly  remained unchanged. Fitch's overall house price decline (HPD) assumption expectations for the  Belgian real-estate market is 5.5%, down from 10% previously. This HPD  assumption reflects our expectation that house prices will remain relatively  unchanged in the coming years, although some disparity could occur between  regions. Fitch's overall base foreclosure frequency for Belgium for a standard loan is  2.2%, unchanged from 2013, reflecting the relatively stable macroeconomic  expectations over the next years and the market-specific performance over the  past 12 months.  Considering historical prepayment data provided by Belgian mortgage lenders and  observed from Belgian RMBS transactions, Fitch has revised downwards its high  voluntary prepayment stress assumptions. We view the revised stresses as  providing a sufficient cushion when compared to the prepayment levels that can  be expected to be reached, even in a context of high refinancing opportunities  with decreasing mortgage rates. The published criteria assumptions will be used for rating new and existing RMBS  transactions and covered bond programmes. The MVD assumptions will also be used  for SME CLOs secured by residential real estate.
