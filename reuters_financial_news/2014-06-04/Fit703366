June 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has upgraded Banco Santander,  S.A.'s <SAN.MC> (Santander, A-/Stable/F2/a-) cedulas hipotecarias (mortgage covered bonds  or CHs) to 'AA-' from 'A' and has placed them on Rating Watch Positive (RWP).   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade reflects an IDR uplift of 2, following the approval of European Bank  Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) by the European Parliament and of the  Council of the European Union on 15 May 2014. As indicated in Fitch's prior  communication with respect to Spanish covered bonds (see "Fitch Revises Outlook  on Spanish Covered Bonds on Criteria Amendments" dated 2 April 2014), the rating  of Santander CHs could be upgraded once the BRRD was sanctioned and provided the  over-collateralisation (OC) that Fitch relies upon in its analysis is  commensurate with the breakeven level for the new ratings. The Issuer Default Rating (IDR) uplift of 2 is based on Fitch's opinion of Spain  being a covered bonds-intensive jurisdiction and Fitch's view that resolution  rather than liquidation methods would most likely be used should Santander fail  to service its senior unsecured obligations. It also reflects on the agency's  view of Santander as a systemically important financial institution in light of  its large size relative to the domestic market.  The 'AA-/RWP' rating of the CHs is based on Santander's Long-term IDR of 'A-',  an IDR uplift of 2 and the minimum OC between cover assets and outstanding CHs  of 25% set by the Spanish legislative framework. This minimum OC provides for  recoveries in excess of 51% on CH assumed to be in default in a 'AA-' scenario,  corresponding to a one-notch uplift from the bank's uplifted IDR.  Fitch will resolve the RWP after receiving updated cover pool data from  Santander, which at the time of this rating action was only available as of  December 2013. The RWP reflects the potential for an upgrade to 'AA' as long as  the cover pool is sufficient to support an outstanding recovery expectation  greater than 91%, which would be commensurate with a two-notch recovery uplift  from the uplifted IDR. If the updated cover pool balance and composition is  broadly similar to the one reported by Santander over the past quarters, Fitch  considers the 'AA' rating would be achievable. Fitch's lifetime default and recovery expectations on the entire cover pool are  22.9% and 44.3%, respectively, under our base case scenario, and 41.9% and 31.2%  under a 'AA-' stress. These expectations take into consideration the cover pool  composition by asset type, which in the case of Santander has a greater  proportion of non-residential mortgages (34%) than the average observed in other  Spanish covered bond programmes rated by Fitch (26%). This larger share of  non-residential assets of Santander cover pool influences its lifetime base case  loss rate of 12.7%, which is slightly above the average expectation for other  Spanish mortgage cover pools rated by Fitch of 10.6%.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The covered bonds could be upgraded if the total cover pool balance provides for  sufficient relied-upon OC in excess of the agency's breakeven OC of 80%  estimated for the 'AA' stress.  The Fitch breakeven OC for a given rating will be affected, among others, by the  profile of the cover assets relative to outstanding covered bonds, which can  change over time, even in the absence of new issuances. Therefore it cannot be  assumed to remain stable.
