BEIJING, June 4 (Reuters) - The current slowing in China's property market is a normal adjustment, and most indicators of the property market are at normal levels, a senior housing ministry official told a media briefing on Wednesday.

Feng Jun, chief economist at the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, also said the government would continue to curb speculation in cities where home prices face upward pressure.
