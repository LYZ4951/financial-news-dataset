KIEV, June 4 (Reuters) - Ukraine's finance ministry said on Wednesday it had paid off in full and on time a 2-year $1 billion Eurobond, news which may bring relief to foreign investors concerned about the country's finances as it battles an insurgency in the east.

"We transferred yesterday $1,039,750,000," an official from the ministry said, adding that the $39.75 million extra was a coupon payment.
