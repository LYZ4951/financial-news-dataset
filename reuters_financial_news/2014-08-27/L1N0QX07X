SAO PAULO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Grupo Oi SA <OIBR3.SA>, the Brazilian telecommunications company grappling with swelling debt, hired investment bank Grupo BTG Pactual <BPAC3.SA> late on Tuesday to advise on a plan to win control of a larger rival.

In a securities filing, Oi named BTG Pactual as a "commissioner" to find potential alternatives to buy the stake that Telecom Italia SpA <TLIT.MI> has in local carrier TIM Participacoes SA <TIMP3.SA>. The filing did not specify any details on the advisory contract or what those alternatives could be.
