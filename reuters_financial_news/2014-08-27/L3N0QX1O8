BANGKOK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares snapped three sessions of falls on Wednesday as bargain hunting emerged in large caps and banks while consumer-related stocks outperformed in Thailand amid expectations of improving domestic economy and more political stability.

Investors looked forward to a Wednesday meeting of president elect Joko "Jokowi" Widodo and current president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to discuss fuel price subsidy, which brokers said could lead to a fuel price increase and higher inflation.[ID:nL3N0QW1VN] "Our sensitivity analysis shows that inflation is likely to rise from 5 percent to 6.6 percent if fuel price is increased from 6,500 rupiah to 8,000 rupiah a litre and markets may fall by about 5 percent in near-term but more positive for long-term," broker Trimegah Securities said in a report. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> was up 0.3 percent, recovering from a 1.2 percent loss over the past three days. Shares of Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> and Astra International <ASII.BK>, among recent losers, led the rebound. In Bangkok, shares of Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK> and retailer CP All <CPALL.BK> rose in strong volumes, bringing the benchmark SET index <.SETI> to 1,569.25 at midday, the highest since May 31, 2013. Bank of Thailand governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said early on Wednesday that economic growth forecast of 1.5 percent for this year is still "highly" possible. [ID:nL3N0QX1S6] The formation of a new government next month could pave the way to government spending and domestic demand recovery, brokers said. [ID:nL3N0QV1DH] "The new cabinet should be formed by early September, on time for the new fiscal year starting in October," broker KGI Securities said in a report. Other equities markets  in Southeast Asia tracked Asia higher, with Singapore <.FTSTI> rebounding from a fall on the previous day, Malaysia <.KLSE> rising from a flat close, the Philippines <.PSI> eking out slim gains and Vietnam <.VNI> hitting the highest since October 2009. The euro came close to cracking on Wednesday as feverish speculation of further policy stimulus in the euro zone drove bond yields to all-time lows and lifted Asian stocks to peaks not seen in almost seven years.
