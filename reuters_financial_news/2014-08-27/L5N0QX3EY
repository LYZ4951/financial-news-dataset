FRANKFURT, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has selected Blackrock Solutions <BLK.N> to provide it with consultancy services in its preparations for a programme to buy asset-backed securities (ABS), an ECB spokesman said on Wednesday.

Blackrock will provide advice on the design and implementation of a potential ABS purchase programme, but all final decisions will be taken by the ECB itself, the spokesman said.
