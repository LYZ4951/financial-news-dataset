LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Ukraine's debt insurance costs rose to a three-month high on Wednesday on continuing worries about the conflict in the east of the country.

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko told Russia's Vladimir Putin after late-night talks on Tuesday that he would work on an urgent ceasefire plan to defuse the conflict. But it remained unclear whether the rebels would agree to the plan and how long it could last. A group of Russian soldiers crossed the border into eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian military said on Wednesday. [ID:nL5N0QX27V]"The fear of the market is that the agreement with Putin is going to be completely ineffective," said Regis Chatellier, emerging markets strategist at Societe Generale. "They also have a situation where we are looking at a change of government, which adds to the uncertainty."  Ukraine 5-year credit default swaps hit a three-month high, up 19 basis points from Tuesday's close to 975 basis points, according to Markit.
