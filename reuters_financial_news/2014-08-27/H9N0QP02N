HONG KONG, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China shares ended a tick firmer on Wednesday, as losses in a few major banks offset gains from the oil and aviation sectors.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended a choppy session up 0.1 percent at 2,209.47 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings inched up 0.2 percent. Among top index boosts, XiAn Aero-Engine PLC <600893.SS> surged the maximum allowed daily limit of 10 percent and AVIC Aircraft <000768.SZ> climbed 4.4 percent.  The manufacturing of China's first large commercial passenger jet, the C919, is to enter the final assembly stage, the 21st Century Business Herald reported late on Monday. Jiangxi Hongdu Aviation Industry <600316.SS>, maker of the aircraft's forebody, jumped 6.3 percent. China Oilfield Services <601808.SS> rose 4.6 percent after posting a 39 percent rise in first-half profit late on Tuesday.
