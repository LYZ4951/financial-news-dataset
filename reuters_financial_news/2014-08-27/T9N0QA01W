TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Japan Post Holdings Co is not thinking of changing its stance on investment in Japanese government bonds, its chief executive said on Wednesday.

Taizo Nishimuro told a regular news conference that a significant change in Japan Post's JGB investment policy would adversely affect the JGB market given its massive holdings of government bonds.
