ISTANBUL, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank cut its overnight lending rate to 11.25 percent from 12 percent on Wednesday despite stubbornly high inflation, at its first rate meeting since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was elected president.

It also cut its primary dealers overnight borrowing rate to 10.75 percent but left its other rates unchanged.
