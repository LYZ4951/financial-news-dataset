PARIS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - European shares were steady in early trade on Wednesday, pausing after their brisk 2-1/2 week rally, with data showing German consumer morale falling for the first time in more than 1-1/2 years denting investors' appetite for stocks.

Market research group GfK said on Wednesday its forward-looking consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 8.6 going into September from a downwardly revised 8.9 in August. [ID:nL9N0O5022] At 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was 0.02 percent higher at 1,376.99 points. The index has surged about 6 percent since a low hit on Aug 8.
