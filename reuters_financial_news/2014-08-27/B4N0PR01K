BERLIN, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a newspaper on Wednesday that European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi had been "overinterpreted" after suggesting that fiscal policy could play a greater role in promoting growth.

The comments, made last Friday have been widely seen as a shift of emphasis towards support for greater fiscal stimulus over austerity. "I know Mario Draghi very well, I think he is being overinterpreted," Schaeuble told the Passauer Neue Presse in an interview, adding he respected the independence of the central banker.
