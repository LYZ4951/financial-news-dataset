LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - British building group Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> said the value of its public-private partnership portfolio had increased by 46 percent to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.74 billion) following a review.

The company, fresh from snubbing a merger proposal from rival construction firm Carillion <CLLN.L> last week which it said undervalued it, said the review was based on a new valuation methodology reflecting amongst other things improved cash flow and macro-economic assumptions. [ID:nL5N0QQ0RT] Public-private partnerships are infrastructure ventures which are funded by a partnership of government and company funds. Balfour Beatty is involved in a total of 37 such projects in Britain and 26 in North America including building roads, hospitals, schools and military housing.
