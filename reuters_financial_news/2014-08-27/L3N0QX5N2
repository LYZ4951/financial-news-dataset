SYDNEY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Australian shares are seen ticking higher in early trade on Thursday, bolstered by a fresh high for the S&P 500, although Australia's national flag carrier Qantas may be hit after a record full-year net loss.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> added 0.2 percent to 5,615.0, but were at a 36.2-point premium/discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark added 0.2 percent on Wednesday, closing at a six-year high in a second day of gains.  * Qantas Airways Ltd <QAN.AX> reported its biggest financial loss ever after taking a hefty A$2.6 billion writedown due to a company restructure that includes a re-valuing of its fleet. [ID:nL3N0QX1L5] * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was flat in early trade. *  U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 creeping up to another record closing high in a lethargic session, although a number of retail stocks traded heavily after reporting results. * Spot iron ore slipped further below $90 a tonne to hit its lowest in nearly two years after futures prices in China and Singapore fell, with buying interest for cargoes tepid. * Copper dipped on the prospect of increasing supply of the metal, offsetting growing confidence in U.S. economic growth, while spot gold edged higher on a lower dollar and lingering geopolitical pressures.  * Atlas Iron Ltd <AGO.AX> posted A$9 million in underlying profit, compared with a year-ago loss, as sharply higher production offset lower iron ore prices. [ID:nL4N0QS1TD] * Capital expenditure data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for Q2 is due out later in the day as well as new home sales data from the Housing Industry Association.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2310 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   2000.12  0.01% 0.100 USD/JPY <JPY=>   103.89   0.04% 0.040 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.3608  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1282.7   0.02% 0.250 US CRUDE<CLc1>   93.76   -0.13%-0.120 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   17122.01 0.09% 15.31 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  154.25   0.06%  0.09 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St drifts to another record high in light trading  [.N]   * Crude oil little-changed after oil inventory draw, Cushing build[O/R]   * Spot gold edges up on dollar drop, heightened tensions[GOL/]   * London copper dips on firm dollar, increasing supply [MET/L]  DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
