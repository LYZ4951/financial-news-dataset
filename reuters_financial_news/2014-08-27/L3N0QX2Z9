MUMBAI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Wednesday to record closing highs as expectations of further monetary stimulus in the Euro zone raised hopes of continued foreign inflows, lifting blue-chips such as ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS>.

The European Central Bank is due to hold its next policy review on Sept. 4, which comes after its president Mario Draghi appeared to open the door for more monetary easing by saying all available tools would be considered should inflation in the euro zone fall further. [MKTS/GLOB] Foreign investors bought Indian shares worth $60.4 million on Tuesday, bringing the total for the year to nearly $13 billion in 2014. Traders now await the expiry of equity derivatives on Thursday, India's April-June growth data on Friday and balance of payments data this week, to gauge near-term direction of the market. "India remains in a bull run. Inflows would continue as a lot of money is waiting on the sidelines to be invested in Indian shares," said Phani Sekhar, fund manager at Angel Broking. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> rose 0.4 percent, or 31.30 points, to end at a record closing high of 7,936.05, and above the psychologically important 7,900 level. The index had climbed to an all-time high of 7,968.25 on Monday. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose 0.44 percent, or 117.34 points, to end at 26,560.15, marking a record closing high and its fifth consecutive day of gains. Blue-chips, which tend to benefit most from foreign inflows, led the gainers: ICICI Bank rose 2.1 percent, Tata Motors Ltd <TAMO.NS> gained 1.8 percent. Companies with significant sales to Europe also gained as expectations grew for further ECB monetary stimulus measures.
