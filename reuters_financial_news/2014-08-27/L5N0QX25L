LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Shares in British online fashion retailer ASOS <ASOS.L>, which have fallen sharply in recent months after profit warnings and a warehouse fire, jumped on Wednesday on an unconfirmed report of a U.S. bid for a stake in the business.

ASOS shares, a previous market darling which have fallen by almost two-thirds this year, surged 13.5 percent to 2,665 pence. British financial website This Is Money said there was "vague talk" of a U.S. cash bid in the region of 50 pounds ($83) a share, adding a U.S. buyer was believed to have approached 27.4 percent shareholder Bestseller, a Danish fashion firm that also holds a stake in German rival Zalando. Among the firms the website said were interested were e-commerce giants eBay <EBAY.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O>. ASOS was not immediately available to comment. ASOS shares fell sharply in June after a fire at the firm's Barnsley distribution centre in northern England, just two weeks after the company warned its full-year profits would miss forecasts by 30 percent. [ID:nL6N0P416D] ASOS had already spooked investors in March when it announced plans to spend on infrastructure to meet future demand, at the expense of short-term profits. [ID:nL6N0MF3M9]
