SEOUL, Aug 27 (Reuters) - South Korean shares rose for the third-straight session on Wednesday, supported by a rally in brokerages after the government announced a plan to allow riskier private investment in retirement pension funds.

Samsung Securities <016360.KS> soared 6 percent while Daewoo Securities <006800.KS> climbed 4 percent. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.33 percent at 2,074.93 points. The South Korean won edged higher as exporters bought the local currency for month-end settlements. However, it briefly pared gains in late trade with dealers citing intervention bids by the financial authorities.
