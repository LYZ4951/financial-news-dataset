HONG KONG, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China shares eked out slim gains on Wednesday morning, thanks to stronger aviation and aerospace sectors that gained on strides made in manufacturing the country's first large aircraft.

Hong Kong's main share index barely changed, but the gauge for H-shares outperformed underpinned by strength in the shares of China Oilfield Services due to strong earnings.  By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was flat at 25,067.18 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 0.5 percent.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings added 0.4 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> edged up 0.2 percent at 2,212.12 points.  "The market is still in a consolidation, weighed down by recent soft economic data and the coming subscriptions for initial public offerings," said Zhang Yanbin, an analyst from Zheshang Securities in Shanghai. Among top index boosts in Shanghai, XiAn Aero-Engine PLC <600893.SS> jumped the maximum allowed 10 percent and China Avic Electronics <600372.SS> 2.4 percent. The manufacturing of China's first large commercial passenger jet, the C919, is to enter the final assembly stage, the 21st Century Business Herald reported late on Monday. Jiangxi Hongdu Aviation Industry <600316.SS>, maker of the aircraft's forebody, climbed 5.2 percent. The biggest drag, Agricultural Bank of China <601288.SS>, fell 0.4 percent. On Tuesday, the country's third-largest bank by assets became the third major Chinese bank to report slowing profit growth and rising bad loans for the second quarter, as a slowing economy hurts lenders. [ID:nL3N0QW2PK] China Oilfield Services <601808.SS> <2883.HK> leapt 8.2 percent in Hong Kong, hitting a 7-month high, and climbing 4.5 percent in Shanghai.
