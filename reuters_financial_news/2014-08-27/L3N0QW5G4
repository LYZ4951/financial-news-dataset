SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, August 27 (Reuters) - Australian shares nudged up on Wednesday thanks to strong earnings and firmer Wall Street stocks, though gains were capped by a handful of top-tier firms trading ex-dividend.

The market has been underpinned in recent weeks by a batch of healthy corporate results, which have helped take some of the sting out of geopolitical tensions. Boral Ltd <BLD.AX> jumped 4.5 percent to its highest since early May of A$5.63 after it said it swung to an annual net profit, led by a recovery in construction activity and lower losses at its U.S. business. [ID:nS9N0PX011] Lend Lease Corp Ltd <LLC.AX> climbed 1.5 percent after its annual net profit jumped 50 percent, in line with recently upgraded company forecasts. [ID:nL4N0QS1VW] "There still seems to be this trend where we're not seeing a lot of revenue growth in a lot of businesses, but we are seeing reasonable earnings growth and that's because there's still a lot of cost cutting going on right across corporate Australia," said Ben Clark, a portfolio manager at TMS Capital. The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> ticked up 10 points or 0.2 percent to 5,647.6 by 0228 GMT. It eked out a gain of 0.1 percent on Tuesday.  The benchmark index hit a 5-1/2 trough of 5,425.2 on August 8 but has since jumped more than 200 points to hover at six-year highs, underpinned by a robust earnings season.  In the U.S., the S&P 500 moved just a hair above the 2,000 mark on Tuesday, its first close above that milestone, after data pointed to a brighter future for the economy. The Big Four banks continued to attract buyers chasing their high dividend yields. Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> added 0.3 percent and National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> rose 0.7 percent.  On the downside, stocks trading ex-dividend dragged on the main index. Among them, Australia's biggest telecommunications provider Telstra Corporation Ltd <TLS.AX> lost 3.4 percent to two-week lows of A$5.54. Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPL.AX> dropped 2.5 percent, while Santos Ltd <STO.AX> lost 1.1 percent.   Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd <FLT.AX> dropped 2.7 percent after reporting its full year net profit after tax of A$206.9 million versus A$246.1 million last year.[ID:nWNBS00NME]New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index <.NZ50> rose 23.1 points to 5,218.73, a 3 1/2-month intraday high.  The index was boosted by a 2.1 percent rise in Air New Zealand <AIR.NZ> to a two-month high of NZ$2.20 after the national carrier announced a 44 percent rise in annual profits and declared a special dividend, while forecasting a further improvement in 2015.
