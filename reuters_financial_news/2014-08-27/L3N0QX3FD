BANGKOK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets gained on Wednesday in line with others in Asia, with Indonesia snapping three days of falls aided by bargain-hunting, but shares of coal miner PT Bumi Resources Tbk <BUMI.JK> came under selling pressure.

Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> finished up 0.4 percent, recovering from a combined 1.2 percent loss over the past three sessions, amid selective buying in recently beaten-down stocks such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK>. Among underperformers, Bumi Resources dropped 2.1 percent after a report that Indonesia may revoke the contracts of 17 coal miners that owe royalties to the government, including PT Arutmin Indonesia, a unit of PT Bumi Resources Tbk. [ID:nL3N0QX2P6] The region brought in foreign inflows amid positive sentiment in Asia, including Malaysia's 157.61 million ringgit($50 million) worth of net foreign buying and Thailand's 419 million baht ($13.13 million), stock exchange data showed. The Philippine stock market <.PSI> posted a net foreign inflow of 1.2 billion peso ($27.48 million), mainly from strong inflows into shares of Philippine Long Distance Telephone <TEL.PS>, stock exchange data showed. The euro was cracking under pressure on Wednesday as feverish speculation of further policy stimulus in the euro zone drove bond yields to all-time lows and lifted Asian stocks to peaks not seen in almost seven years.
