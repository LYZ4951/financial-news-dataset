ZURICH, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Switzerland's housing bubble has been gradually easing since January, averting the danger of house prices plummeting, according to an annual study published on Wednesday.

Housing prices are in focus ahead of the Swiss National Bank's quarterly monetary policy assessment in September, after Swiss bank UBS <UBSN.VX> said this month that steps to shrink Switzerland's housing bubble were taking effect.

The study, conducted in conjunction with comparis.ch, an Internet comparison shopping tool, said Switzerland will avoid a property crash despite persistently high housing prices. For the first time since 2013, there were no areas deemed as critical, and the danger in nine districts that had shown a bubble in the last report, from January, had dispersed, it said. The state provides no official data on the housing market. Mortgage lenders, the Swiss government and the central bank are fighting high property prices -- fuelled by ultra-low interest rates, immigration and Switzerland's appeal as a safe haven for financial investors -- with a variety of supply- and demand-side measures.
