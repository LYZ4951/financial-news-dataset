MANILA, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Philippine liquor maker Emperador Inc <EMP.PS> is set to debut in the Philippines' benchmark stock index on Sept. 15, replacing the country's largest miner Philex Mining Corp <PX.PS>, the bourse said on Wednesday.

Emperador, which mainly makes brandy, will join the 30-company index following a year-long review of trading activities, the exchange said in a statement. The Philippine Stock Exchange <PSE.PS> changes the PSEi's composition based on a stock's liquidity, free float and market capitalisation. Hong Kong-listed First Pacific Company Ltd <0142.HK> is the principal investor in Philex.
