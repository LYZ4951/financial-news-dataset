WARSAW, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Poland's Alior Bank <ALRR.WA> is selling its wholly owned drugstore chain Polbita to drug distributor Pelion <PELIO.WA> and will take an impairment charge on the asset that will cut third-quarter net profit by 31 million zlotys ($9.7 million).

The No. 15 Polish bank in terms of assets said on Wednesday it would sell the company, operator of a chain of 270 shops, for an undisclosed sum.
