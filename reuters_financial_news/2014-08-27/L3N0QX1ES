HONG KONG, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Shenzhen stock exchange has submitted a plan to launch a programme letting it connect to Hong Kong's stock market like one planned for Shanghai, media reports said on Wednesday.

Authorities in the southern Chinese city will promote the launch of a "through train" stock trading system similar to what is being launched between Hong Kong and Shanghai, the official China daily reported, quoting Xiao Zhijia, deputy director-general of Shenzhen's Office of Financial Development Service. When contacted by Reuters, Shenzhen's office of Financial Development Services did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the article. The Shenzhen stock exchange, a rival to Shanghai's market,  looks to emulate the Nasdaq in the United States by focusing on companies in their early growth stages. It also has some big-name listings, including China Vanke <000002.SZ>, the country's biggest residential property developer.   Authorities expect the landmark stock-connect programme between Shanghai and Hong Kong - another step in China's efforts to open up its markets - will launch in October. Regulators and market participants are racing to test mechanisms to ensure readiness. While China investors anticipate a wave of institutional money will flow into the mainland's relatively undervalued markets, Hong Kong stock punters are hoping Chinese money will boost trading volumes and lift stocks.
