MELBOURNE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Australian shares are poised to open higher on Monday, underpinned by steady metals and oil prices, takeover activity and bargain hunters snapping up beaten-down stocks.

* Share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 1.3 percent to 5,305.0 to sit at a 33.3-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 0.4 percent on Friday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.6  percent to 5,178.6 in early trade. * Wall Street gave a strong lead, with U.S. stocks having extended their rebound on Friday from this month's bruising selloff, as worries about the U.S. earnings outlook eased. However the S&P 500 still posted its fourth straight week of declines. *  Industrial metals rebounded on Friday, taking a pause after heavy losses this week, but analysts cautioned that markets were still on edge and vulnerable to deeper losses. Gold slipped on Friday but posted a second straight weekly gain. * Transfield Services <TSE.AX> said on Monday it had rejected a A$1 billion ($876 million) takeover proposal from Ferrovial Servicios SA <FER.MC>, but said it was open to talking to and opening its books to the Spanish firm. The proposal at A$1.95 a share was at a 30 percent premium to Transfield's last trade. [ID:nL3N0SE0MK] * Downer EDI <DOW.AX> said it had bought gas, power and water infrastructure contractor Tenix Holdings Australia for A$300 million ($263 million), funded through a bank debt facility.
