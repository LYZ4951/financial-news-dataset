DUBAI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The recent slump in U.S. stock prices, in which the S&P 500 index <.SPX> has posted four straight weekly losses for the first time in more than three years, is unlikely to go on for much longer, one of America's best-known investment strategists said on Sunday.

Byron Wien, veteran investor and vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners, part of investment and advisory firm Blackstone Group LP <BX.N>, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai it was unlikely the U.S. market would fall much further.  "Nobody knows how long it (falling markets) lasts and it always goes farther than you think, but I do think it's a correction and not the beginning of a bear market," Wien said. A bear market is an extended phase during which shares slump some 20 percent from their peak levels. "Maybe it'll go a little bit further, but it's already gone down almost 10 percent, so I hope we're nearing the end of it," Wien added. The S&P 500 was down more than 6 percent at the end of last week from a record high set in September, despite a rally on Friday aided by estimate-beating third-quarter earnings from blue chip stocks including General Electric <GE.N>.
