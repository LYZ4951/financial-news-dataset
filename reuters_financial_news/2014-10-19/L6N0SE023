DUBAI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Burgan Bank <BURG.KW>, Kuwait's third-largest lender by assets, will launch a 21.6 million dinars ($74.8 million) rights issue by the end of 2014 pending regulatory approvals, it said in a bourse filing on Sunday.

Burgan said it plans to issue 216 million new shares and that the rights issue will raise its paid-up capital to 197.18 million dinars. This would indicate that shares would be priced at 0.1 dinars in the rights issue, a significant discount to the 0.54 dinars the stock closed at on Thursday. The shares will be available to existing shareholders on a proportional basis and any unsold shares will then be put on general sale, the bank said in the statement.
