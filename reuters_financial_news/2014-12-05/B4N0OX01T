FRANKFURT, Dec 5 (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Jens Weidmann said on Friday that the ECB's monetary policy for the euro zone was rightly expansionary, though he said it was too loose for Germany, Europe's largest economy.

"We have a monetary policy that is too expansive for Germany," he said at an event hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit in Frankfurt.
