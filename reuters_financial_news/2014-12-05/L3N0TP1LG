SHANGHAI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chinese stocks slipped early Friday, but the fall was checked by soaring brokerage shares and a key index could produce its best week this year as small investors stayed bullish.

The main indices both rose over 2 percent before investors booked profits, particularly on property shares that earlier surged on speculation Beijing would ease policy further.  At the end of the morning, the CSI300 index <.CSI300> was off 0.6 percent at 3,084.98 points and the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> also lost 0.6 percent, to 2,881.28 points. The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mostly high tech startups listed in Shenzhen slumped 3.3 percent. "There is strong profit-taking pressure, with the index set to hit 3,000 points and after such a big jump," said Zhang Yanbin, analyst at Zheshang Securities in Shanghai. The real estate sub-index of the CSI300 <.CSICMREI> fell 3.1 percent but remained up over 4 percent for the week. Haitong Securities <600837.SS>, Hong Yuan Securities <000562.SZ> and Southwest Securities <600369.SS> rose their 10 percent daily limits. The Shanghai Composite and CSI300 leapt around 20 percent during a bull run the past nine days after China's first interest rate cut in more than two years. The CSI300 is up over 9 percent this week and the SSEC 7 percent. But volatility has also risen. Ten-day volatility on the CSI300 stood at over 30 on Friday, its highest since a cash crunch of 2013 saw indexes tank. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index <.HSI> rose 0.7 percent, to 24,007.69 points, mainly supported by overseas flows, with financials leading gains. The Hong Kong China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> gained 1.1 percent, to 11,611.39. For the week, the indexes were up 0.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. "Overseas money inflows added to the momentum, leading to a high turnover today," said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong shares of dual-listed Chinese firms continued to trade at sharp discounts to onshore versions, with the A-H share premium index <.HSCAHPI> hovering near an 17-month high.  The index was down about 0.14 percent at 113.72. A value over 100 indicates that shares in dual-listed companies are cheaper in Hong Kong than in Shanghai. Total volume of A-shares traded in Shanghai was 43.73 billion shares, while Shenzhen had 21.08 billion shares.
