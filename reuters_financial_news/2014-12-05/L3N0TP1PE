JAKARTA, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Indonesian oil and gas firm PT Energi Mega Persada <ENRG.JK> hopes to refinance $170 million worth of loans by February next year and is considering acquisitions to raise its production, its top executive said on Friday.

Energi Mega is trying to replace loans from Farallon Capital bearing an annual interest rate of 18 percent above LIBOR with loans from Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> at 11 percent, president director Imam Agustino said at a briefing. Energi Mega is part of Indonesian conglomerate Bakrie Group, which has expanded into mining, plantations, telecommunication, property and other businesses mainly through debt-funded acquisitions.

It is also seeking a partner to drill for oil and gas in Mozambique, he added. "We hope that by 2020, our production can reach 200,000 barrels per day. So it can't just be organic (growth), it can also be inorganic," Agustino said, declining to disclose how it will get the funding.
