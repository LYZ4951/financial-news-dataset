TORONTO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia <BNS.TO>, Canada's No. 3 lender, reported a weaker fourth-quarter profit on Friday after taking a previously announced charge related to soured bets in the Caribbean and Latin America.

This compared with a profit of C$1.7 billion, or C$1.29 per share, a year earlier. Excluding notable items, the bank said it had earned C$1.32 a share. Analysts had expected C$1.40. Scotiabank had warned it November it expected to book a pretax charge of C$451 million. It had said the moves would reduce earnings by about 28 Canadian cents a share. [ID:nL4N0SU5C9]
