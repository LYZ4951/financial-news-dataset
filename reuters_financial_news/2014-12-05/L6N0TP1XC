NICOSIA, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Cyprus on Friday eased restrictions on overseas payments, but fell short of scrapping completely capital controls imposed in the wake of a bailout crisis in early 2013.

Authorities said they would raise the limit on cash transfers abroad to 2 million euros without prior permission required, from 1 million euros.  Individuals would also be able to transfer up to 10,000 euros out of the country per month, from a previous 5,000 limit. Travellers abroad would also be allowed 6,000 euro per person, from a previous 3,000 euro ceiling. Cyprus introduced capital controls in April 2013 to prevent a cash flight after a chaotic bailout forced the closure of one bank, and a second bank seized deposits to recapitalise.  It was the first time controls were imposed in the history of the euro zone.
