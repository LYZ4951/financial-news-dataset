Dec 5 (Reuters) - Teen apparel and accessories retailer Delia*s Inc <DLIA.O> said it was liquidating assets and would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection "in the very near term," wiping out more than 85 percent of its market value.

New York-based Delia*s, which launched a review of strategic alternatives in September, said it was unable to sell itself or secure financing to allow it to remain a going concern. [ID:nBw4Jq0wRa] Delia*s, like many other teen apparel retailers, has been losing market share to fast-fashion brands such as H&M <HMb.ST>, Forever 21 and Inditex's <ITX.MC> Zara, which bring the latest styles from the runway to their stores within weeks. The company, which has not reported a quarterly profit since early 2011, previously disclosed total liabilities of $37.6 million and assets of $75.6 million as of Aug. 2.
