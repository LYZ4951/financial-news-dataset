SEOUL, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> edged higher on Friday as dollar bulls paused ahead of the release of U.S. non-farm payrolls data, although gains were capped by fears of intervention by financial authorities amid prolonged weakness in the yen <JPY=>.

The won <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,114.1 to the dollar at the end of onshore trade, compared to Thursday's close of 1,115.2 and down 0.6 percent for the week. South Korean shares closed nearly unchanged after trading in a tight range all session, although bargain-hunting in battered sectors provided limited support.
