SINGAPORE, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation Ltd's <KTEL.SI> initial public offering (IPO) of a real estate investment trust for its data centres is set to raise S$513 million ($390 million), in what would be the second-biggest listing in Singapore this year.

Keppel DC REIT said the offering of 261.1 million units was priced at the top end of the price range at S$0.93 per unit.  Keppel T&T, a unit of conglomerate Keppel Corp <KPLM.SI>, has data centres in Asia and Europe.   Cornerstone investors such Fortress Capital and Eastspring Investments will separately buy S$270 million worth of shares, the statement said. The successful pricing comes after Universal Terminal postponed its up to S$1 billion ($762 million) business trust IPO of oil storage terminals earlier this week due to uncertain market conditions, IFR reported.
