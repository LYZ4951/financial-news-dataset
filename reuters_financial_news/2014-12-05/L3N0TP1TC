SYDNEY, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 0.6 percent on Friday, weighed by losses in mining and energy firms with investors nervous ahead of a key U.S. jobs report that could trigger sharp moves.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> shed 33.5 points to 5,335.3 at the close of trade, but was still up 0.4 percent for the week.
