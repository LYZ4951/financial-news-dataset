LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - British infrastructure group Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> said on Friday it had rejected a 1 billion pound ($1.6 billion) offer from John Laing Infrastructure Fund <JLIF.L> for its public-private partnership assets.

The non-binding proposal, which was made on Monday, fell significantly short of Balfour's valuation of the portfolio, the company said in a statement. [ID:nL6N0TL0RY]
