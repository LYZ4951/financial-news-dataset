HANOVER, Germany, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> finance division expects 2014 operating profit to narrowly beat last year's result of 1.6 billion euros ($1.98 billion), its Chief Executive Frank Witter said.

VW Financial Services handles dealer and customer financing and the German car maker's banking and leasing business.  The division benefited strongly from its insurance and servicing operations which may post 18 percent growth this year to 4.4 million contracts, Witter told reporters at a briefing late Thursday.
