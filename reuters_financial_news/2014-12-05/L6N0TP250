LAGOS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Nigerian naira <NGN=D1> closed at 180.1 to the dollar on Friday, the same level as its previous close, after the central bank stepped into the market to sell U.S. currency to some commercial lenders, dealers said.

The currency remains below a new target band of 160-176 to the dollar, set by the central bank last week after it devalued the currency by 8 percent. The naira eased slightly in early trades on Friday, weakening to 182.65 against dollar, before central bank intervention helped it recover, dealers said.
