TBILISI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Georgia's central bank said on Friday it had all instruments to prevent possible further major fluctuations in the lari and protect financial stability in the ex-Soviet country after a sharp fall in the value of the national currency.

The Georgian lari slipped to 1.9527 per dollar on Friday from 1.7542 lari at the start of November and 1.7379 at the beginning of this year. "There is no threat to financial and macroeconomic stability," Georgy Kadagidze, the National Bank chief, told reporters, adding the currency depreciation of the last few days had a "speculative nature." "If we monitor rise in negative expectations and risks, we will intervene and use all instruments that we have to prevent further fluctuations." Kadagidze said the lari's depreciation was the result of recent developments on regional and international markets. He said the central bank did not expect any major inflationary pressure due to the currency fluctuations. Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent year-on-year in November after rising 3.4 percent year-on-year in October. In month-on-month terms, consumer prices declined 0.1 percent in November, down from 0.3 percent monthly inflation in October. The government targets 2014 inflation in the former Soviet South Caucasus republic at 6.0 percent. Georgia's central bank kept its key refinancing rate unchanged at 4 percent on Nov. 19, after data showed annual inflation below the government's 2014 target.
