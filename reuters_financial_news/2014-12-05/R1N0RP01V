ROME, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said on Friday that the country would likely see more consumer price declines in coming months, which could create a deflationary situation that can have "very serious consequences" for high-debt countries like Italy.

It is "likely" that Italy will see further price declines in coming months, Visco said at a conference in Rome.
