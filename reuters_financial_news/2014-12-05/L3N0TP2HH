HANOI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.07 percent at Friday's close in cautious trade amid market talks that a cap on banks' investment in stocks due early next year might be delayed, while Vietcombank <VCB.HM> hit a multi-year high.

As of Feb. 1, 2015 banks can lend a maximum 5 percent of its registered capital for share investment, and only banks with bad debts below 3 percent of loans are qualified for the loans, a central bank's directive issued last month said. [ID:nL3N0TB1NV] Volume was below the five-day average level at 107 million shares while stocks moved mixed. Analysts said the cap could hurt short-term liquidity on the equity markets. Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, the country's top lender by market value, attracted heavy trading and ticked up 3.41 percent to 30,300 dong ($1.42), its highest close since May 2012, Reuters data showed. Ho Chi Minh City-based Eximbank <EIB.HM>, however, retreated 2.24 percent from a combined 20-percent gain in the previous four sessions on market talks of a merger deal.
