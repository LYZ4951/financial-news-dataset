NAIROBI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Kenya has raised $750 million by increasing its debut $2 billion Eurobond, which closed in June, a senior Finance Ministry official said on Friday.

Investors in Kenya have been watching the fund-raising exercise closely, in part because the market has faced a shortage of dollars, due largely to a slide in revenues from tourism as a result of a spate of Islamist militant attacks. Kenya added $250 million to the five-year tranche of the Eurobond, paying a 5.0 percent yield and $500 million to the 10-year tranche at 5.9 percent. The original 10-year bond paid a yield of 6.875 percent and the five-year 5.875 percent. "The interest rates were very favourable," said Finance Ministry principal secretary Kamau Thuge. "They (investors) are seeing a good credit story and a good growth story." He added that the cash was already in Kenya. Investors have snapped up African bonds in recent months, eying the continent's strong growth rates.
