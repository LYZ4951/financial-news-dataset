NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - March 9 marks the five-year anniversary of the bottom for U.S. equities, the culmination of a 56.8 percent plunge in the S&P 500 from its previous record as the economy fell into its worst recession since the Great Depression.

Since the S&P 500's closing low of 676.53 on that day in 2009, the benchmark index has climbed more than 177 percent. Its advance has been driven by massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve, a drawdown in debt and a rebound in corporate profits. The S&P 500 ended on Friday at a record high at 1,878.04.  Over the same time span, the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> has gained more than 150 percent while the Nasdaq <.IXIC> has rocketed more than 240 percent.
