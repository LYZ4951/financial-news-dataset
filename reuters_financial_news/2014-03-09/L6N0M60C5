PRAGUE, March 9 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank will not tolerate any sharp firming of the crown currency next year when it expects to end its current policy of keeping the crown weak, Governor Miroslav Singer said in a television interview on Sunday.    The bank intervened to weaken the currency by about 7 percent to the euro <EURCZK=> last November to prevent the economy from falling into deflation. The steps followed cutting interest rates to 0.05 percent.

The bank pledged to prevent the crown from firming above around 27 to the euro, and expects to maintain the regime at least until early 2015. The currency stood at 27.35 on Friday. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive in crown terms and therefore adds to inflation, which the bank says would fall below zero if it did not act. Singer said that even after leaving the regime, the bank would not allow the crown to jump back quickly or recover the ground lost against the euro in the November interventions."I cannot imagine we would want to see movements that would bring the economy back deep below zero or toward zero, or (cause) undershooting of the inflation target," Singer said on Czech Television. "I cannot imagine we would go through this entire episode (of interventions) just to face the same problem half a year later," he said. He said the bank would discuss in the coming months how to communicate the expected exit from the interventions regime. He added that the central bank has always had the option to intervene in the foreign exchange market, and had done so in the past to fight sharp currency movements.
