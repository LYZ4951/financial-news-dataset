BOGOTA, April 23 (Reuters) - Colombia's financial regulator said on Wednesday it will increase the proportion of liquid assets brokerages must hold starting in November, in a bid to reduce exposure to risk.

The regulator said it will alter, and impose limits on, the way it measures liquidity risk. The new rules will require brokerages to hold a big enough share of liquid assets in their portfolios to offset risk from cash investments, term deposits and investments in derivatives.
