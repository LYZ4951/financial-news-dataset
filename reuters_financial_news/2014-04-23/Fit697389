April 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised Carrefour SA's <CARR.PA> (Carrefour)  Outlook to Positive from Stable. Its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and  senior unsecured rating have been affirmed at 'BBB'.  The Positive Outlook reflects signs of a successful turnaround in Carrefour's  French business in 2013 (including strong operating margin improvement and  better price positioning), rapid de-leveraging over the past two years and its  reinforced financial flexibility.  Fitch does not expect net debt to continue to substantially decrease over the  next two years, following the divestment of non-core assets and as the company  enters a comprehensive store investment phase. However, the agency believes that  Carrefour will be able to generate sustained sales and profit growth through  accelerated capex, leading to funds from operations (FFO) generation and further  credit metric enhancement. This could then support an upgrade to 'BBB+' within  the next 12-18 months.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Improved Operating Margin In 2013 Carrefour's operating margin increased to 2.9% from 2.7% in 2012, mainly  due to a substantial improvement in France, where its share of profits increased  to 51% of the group total (2012: 42%). We expect the improvement in the  operating profit margin to be at least sustainable at the group level. This  reflects a structural improvement in the French operations' cost structure, as  well as expected stabilisation of the foreign operations' profitability. Spain  shows signs of recovery, while Latin America's increasing profitability, based  on strong organic sales growth, should compensate for recurring weaknesses in  Asia.   French Turnaround  Last year marked a turning point in Carrefour's French operations, with the  fastest organic growth since 2007 and its operating margin up by 80 bps  year-on-year at 3.4%. Hypermarket sales are back in growth territory and gross  margins have seen strong increases due to an improved commercial mix. As  Carrefour's largest market, France is key to its business profile enhancement.   The rating assumes further investments in sales (refurbishment, acceleration of  expansion) and in costs (ongoing IT and logistics restructuring). Sustainable  profit improvement in the French operations will depend on Carrefour's capacity  to generate sufficiently high sales volumes to offset the recurring "price  reductions" (margin sacrifice) required in a highly competitive environment that  is still characterised by weak consumer confidence.   Strengthened Financial Flexibility  Lease-adjusted FFO net leverage (excluding financial services) decreased to 3.1x  in 2013 from 3.8x in 2011 while the group enjoys a strong liquidity profile. The  group has used most of its non-core business disposal proceeds to reduce debt. A  prudent financial policy, with limited dividends and capex outflows led to  positive free cash flow (FCF) generation in 2012 and 2013. The Positive Outlook  reflects our confidence that Carrefour will enter a virtuous cycle of financial  and business profile improvements as financial flexibility generates further  operating performance gains, notably through capex acceleration.  Foreign Operations Next Challenge  The success of the final part of Carrefour's renewal strategy will depend on  accelerating sales and profit growth from foreign operations as the French  market matures. This will be important to ensuring the long-term sustainability  of sound credit metrics.  In this respect the Chinese market has not yet improved despite Carrefour's  growing scale (236 hypermarkets at end-2013). While Spain is showing signs of  recovery, Italy remains Carrefour's weakness in Europe. Latin America enjoys  solid organic growth but faces increasing competition. The Positive Outlook  assumes  that management will achieve a more balanced growth profile across all  regions through accelerated store renovation and expansion in Latin America,  expansion in China and the Italian turnaround process, among others. Deleveraging to Continue  Fitch expects lease-adjusted FFO net leverage (excluding financial services) to  be at or below 3.0x by 2016. Net debt should remain fairly stable, with no  material deterioration expected in the group's cash balances.  At the FCF level, we assume that increasing capex should be offset by the  continuation of a prudent financial policy, notably regarding working capital  management and dividend distribution. FCF should mostly absorb remaining tax  litigation payments and limited acquisition activity. Carrefour's leverage and  FFO fixed charge cover ratios should benefit from growing FFO generation. In the  short-term this will be supported by maintaining a low level of absolute debt,  as well as contained interest and restructuring costs.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action include: -Group EBIT margin sustained at above 3%, mainly reflecting further improvement  in France and the stabilisation of other European operations; together with  positive FCF generation on a sustained basis -FFO fixed charge cover sustained at or above 3.0x (2013: 2.6x) -Lease-adjusted FFO net leverage (excluding financial services) sustained at  around 3.0x (corresponding to 2.5x on EBITDAR basis)  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: -Group EBIT margin falling to 2.5% or below -Recurring negative FCF, reflecting a further deterioration of the consumer  environment and/or no impact from Carrefour's initiatives to improve its  operating performance -FFO fixed charge cover below 2.0x -Lease-adjusted FFO net leverage (excluding financial services) trending  towards 4.0x (corresponding to 3.5x on EBITDAR basis)
