April 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has updated its non-US International Local and Regional Government Ratings Criteria.  The updated report replaces the criteria published on 6 April 2013. The main  change is the reference to the scoring card and the merger of the "Ratings  Subnational Above The Sovereign - Outside US" criteria which was previously  under separate criteria. However, there is no impact on existing local and  regional government ratings.  The criteria report is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the  link below.
