MADRID, April 23 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Bankinter <BKT.MC> on Wednesday said net profit rose 19.1 percent to 60 million euro ($83 million) in the first quarter from a year ago, helped by growing net lending income but missing analyst expectations.

Five analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an average first quarter net profit of 65 million euros. [ID:nL6N0NE3RI]
