MUMBAI, April 23 (Reuters) - Indian shares hit record highs for a third consecutive session on Wednesday as infrastructure-related companies such as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> extended recent gains, offsetting profit-taking in other outperformers such as Tata Motors <TAMO.NS>.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.52 percent higher at 22,876.54. The index had advanced as much as 0.63 percent earlier in the day to a record high of 22,912.52.
