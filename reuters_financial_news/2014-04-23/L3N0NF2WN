HANOI, April 23 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stocks lost ground on Wednesday, led by Singapore with investors booking profits after recent gains; while shares in Thailand bucked the regional trend to close at a critical resistance level.

The Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> fell 0.6 percent on profit-taking after a winning streak of six days. It had closed at its highest level in nearly 11 months on Tuesday. [ID:nL3N0NE2C1] Keppel Corporation Ltd <KPLM.SI> was the top loser, with shares dropping 3.45 percent to their one-month low as the stock went ex-dividend on Wednesday at 30 Singapore cents, according to data from the Singapore Exchange. KPLM has lost 5 percent since April 16 when it reported a 5 percent drop in first-quarter net profit compared with a year earlier. [ID:nWNBS00F9F] "Results came in weaker than expected, so (Keppel's) share prices have actually been off since," said an analyst with Maybank Kim Eng. The Jakarta Composite Index <.JKSE> and Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> both edged down 0.1 percent each, and Philippine equities <.PSI> reversed their four-session winning streak with a 0.23 percent fall. But stocks in Thailand <.SETI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> bucked the trend, rising 0.59 percent and 0.05 percent respectively.  Analysts expect the SET Index would face a correction soon as it has reached a critical resistance level between 1,420 and 1,430.
