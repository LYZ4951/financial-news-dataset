LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce <RR.L> has won a $400 million contract with Azul Brazilian Airlines to service Rolls-Royce engines, which it said will be used to power the Brazilian company's aircraft.

Rolls, the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines behind U.S. group General Electric <GE.N>, said on Wednesday Azul's six Airbus A330-200 and five A350-900 XWB aircraft would be powered by its Trent 700 and Trent XWB engines respectively.
