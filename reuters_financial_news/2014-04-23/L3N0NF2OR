MUMBAI, April 23 (Reuters) - Indian shares hit record highs for a third session in a row as infrastructure companies such as Larsen & Toubro extended recent gains while lenders including Yes Bank advanced on hopes the worst was over in terms of asset quality deterioration.

Sentiment was also supported as foreign investors remained net buyers for a third consecutive session on Tuesday, though of shares worth a modest $30.80 million, bringing their net total to $135.24 million since Thursday. Still, broader gains were capped by continued profit-taking in recent outperformers such as Tata Motors Ltd <TAMO.NS>, and by falls in regional shares after a survey showed manufacturing activity in China was still contracting in April. [MKTS/GLOB]  Analysts expect gains to be limited in the near-term as companies post their financial results and India continues its five-week-long election process. Markets will remain shut on Thursday when Mumbai goes to the polls. "This is the time to be cautious as markets have spiked up substantially. You will have to look out for good quality stocks, where valuation comfort is still there," said Daljeet S Kohli, head of research at IndiaNivesh Securities.
