PARIS, April 23 (Reuters) - Safran expects "very solid" orders for engines and other equipment in 2014 amid robust activity in the commercial aircraft market, its chief executive said on Wednesday.

Jean-Paul Herteman also said the French group was continuing to work on a possible purchase of Italy's Avio Spazio, but had no further plans for acquisitions in the United States beyond  completion of the $270 million purchase of a division from Eaton Corp <ETN.N>, expected in the first half. [ID:nL2N0KU0KV] British private equity fund Cinven wants to sell its 81 percent stake in Italian space propulsion company Avio and has said several buyers, including Safran, have expressed interest. Airbus Group <AIR.PA> is also seen as a bidder [ID:nWEB00ISD]. There has been speculation about whether Herteman would seek to remain chief executive of partially state-owned French aerospace group Safran when his mandate expires in May 2015.   Such a decision would require a change in retirement age.
