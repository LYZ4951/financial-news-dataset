CAIRO, April 23 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound weakened at a central bank dollar sale <CBEO> on Wednesday but strengthened on the black market.

The central bank said it sold dollars at a cut-off price of 6.9853 pounds, weaker than the rate of 6.9802 pounds at its last sale on Thursday before a long holiday weekend. Dollar shortages have fuelled a thriving black market, but the dollar rate slipped further on Wednesday ahead of another long weekend as people opt to wait until next week to buy. A trader on the parallel market said the dollar was being offered at 7.37 pounds on Wednesday, compared with 7.47 on Thursday. The central bank sold $38.3 million on Wednesday, it said. It had offered $40 million.
