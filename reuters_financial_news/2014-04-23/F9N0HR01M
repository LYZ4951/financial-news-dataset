TALLINN, April 23 (Reuters) - Quantitative easing, or printing money to buy assets, would be operationally complex for the European Central Bank, ECB policymaker Ardo Hansson said on Wednesday, adding that he saw a lot of questions around how to implement such a programme.

Seeking to head off a drop in inflation expectations, the ECB governing council said earlier this month it was unanimous in its commitment to use unconventional tools - central bank-speak for things like quantitative easing (QE) - to counter a protracted period of low inflation. But Hansson, who sits on the governing council, expressed concerns about QE, telling Reuters: "I still have questions because it is so operationally complex." "There are a lot of issues you that have to decide," he added on the sidelines of a news conference in Tallinn.
