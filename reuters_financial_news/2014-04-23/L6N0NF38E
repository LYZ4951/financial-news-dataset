LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - British insurance company Saga is planning to announce its intention to float next week in a London stock market debut that could value the company at 3 billion pounds ($5.1 billion), two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Saga, which is owned by Permira, Charterhouse [CHCAP.UL] and CVC <CVC.UL>, would raise at least 750 million pounds assuming the London stock exchange's minimum free float of 25 percent, one of the sources said.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N> will lead the deal, with Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> and Citi <C.N> as joint bookrunners, the other source said.
