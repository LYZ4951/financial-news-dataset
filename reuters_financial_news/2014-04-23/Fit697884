April 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Novartis <NOVN.VX> and GlaxoSmithKline's <GSK.L> (GSK) asset swap deal  highlights the industry's growing emphasis on efficiency through more focused  research and development (R&D) and the pursuit of scale in consumer healthcare,  Fitch Ratings says. We do not expect the transaction to affect either company's  credit rating when it completes. As the risk and cost of bringing new drugs to market rises, we expect  pharmaceutical companies to concentrate on a smaller number of therapeutic  areas. With a full late stage oncology pipeline across the sector, we see  oncology drugs as a key area of competition due to the high returns available  and the prospects for next generation treatments, particularly in combination  with already established drugs. Adding to its already strong oncology portfolio and the potential for  combination therapies are likely to be key benefits for Novartis in its  acquisition of GSK's oncology business, which will consolidate the group's  position as the second largest in the field. For GSK the disposal of its cancer  drug portfolio, where it didn't have the scale to compete, and the acquisition  of Novartis' vaccines business will enable it to focus on the stronger areas in  its R&D pipelines, including vaccines and respiratory drugs. The combination of the companies' consumer healthcare arms highlights the  importance of scale in driving efficiency in this segment. The joint venture  will create the second largest global consumer healthcare business, improving  geographic reach and supply chain logistics. The limited geographical and  product overlap should help the companies obtain regulatory approval. If the deal is approved it's likely to have little impact on GSK's financial  ratios, given that a large portion of the proceeds will be passed through to  shareholders via extraordinary share buybacks, but we expect some margin benefit  in the long term from cost savings. The group's business profile would benefit  from becoming the global leader in the vaccines segment in addition to the  improved position in consumer healthcare. This creates a more stable growth  platform with still sufficient diversification.
