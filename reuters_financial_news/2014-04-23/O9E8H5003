TALLINN, April 23 (Reuters) - The Estonian central bank said on Wednesday that the risks to the Baltic state's financial stability have increased due to the crisis in Ukraine, weakness in the return to growth in the euro zone and high real estate prices in Nordic countries.

Euro zone member Estonia's banking sector is more than 90 percent owned by the Nordic banking groups like SEB <SEBa.ST>, Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> and Nordea <NDA.ST> and the small, open economy is strongly affected by the global economy. "On top of the risks stemming from the recovery of growth in the euro area, political uncertainty has increased following the events in Ukraine, and with it uncertainty about economic developments in trading partners," the Estonian central bank said in its financial stability report.  The bank warned there remains the danger the risk assessment for the Nordic economies and banks could worsen, which would increase funding and liquidity risks of the parent banking groups and could be passed on to the Estonian financial sector. But the bank added that the Estonian banking sector is more self-sufficient for loans from local deposits compared to the 2008-2010 recession. The bank said it was prepared to act to make sure local banks did not lend irresponsibly as the country recorded a price rally in real estate sector.  "It will be important that banks continue to follow responsible lending principles when assessing the loan repayment ability of borrowers and requiring them to make sufficient down payments," it said. "Eesti Pank is prepared to impose requirements for stricter lending conditions if necessary," the bank added.
