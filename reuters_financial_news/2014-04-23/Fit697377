April 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has revised Germany-based E.ON SE's <EONGn.DE> (E.ON) Outlook to Negative from Stable and affirmed its Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) at 'A-'. Its Short-term IDR was affirmed at 'F2' and its senior unsecured  rating at 'A-'. The Outlook revision reflects mainly weaker-than-expected earnings contributions  from E.ON's growth businesses - Russia and exploration & production - as well as  guidance on operating cash flow of EUR5.4bn (E.ON EBITDA guidance for 2014 of  EUR8bn-8.6bn and cash flow conversion at 60%-70%). These changes have resulted  in an increase of forecast leverage that would not be commensurate with an 'A-'  IDR in the short- to medium-term, even after taking into account reduced  business risk from a change in earnings contributions from the company's various  divisions.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Weaker Earnings from Growth Businesses A tariff freeze in Russia and a material depreciation of the rouble have led to  a reduction in forecast earnings for this division, although operational  performance continues to be strong. At the same time, production targets for  hydrocarbon assets in the North Sea have been materially revised downwards over  the last six months, demonstrating execution risk of E.ON's business plan. In  response Fitch has cut forecast EBITDA for these businesses by around EUR700m  for the medium-term.Business Mix Warrants Higher Leverage Guideline A change in the composition of prospective earnings, ie lower contributions from  Russia and exploration & production plus (proportionally) higher contributions  from regulated or quasi-regulated earnings, have caused Fitch to raise its  leverage guideline to 3.75x on both a lease-adjusted and a nuclear-adjusted  funds from operations (FFO) basis, from 3.5x previously.   Credit Metrics Weakly Placed   Under Fitch's calculations E.ON reported a lease-adjusted and nuclear-adjusted  FFO net leverage of 3.84x at end-2013, with a corresponding fixed charge cover  of 5.61x. The group made sizeable pension deficit repair payments during the  year. Normalising cash flow for recurring pension contributions would have  brought leverage to within the 3.75x guideline. However, taking into account  management guidance for operating cash flow of EUR5.4bn for 2014 gearing is  likely to rise and remain above 3.75x for some time. Therefore, the agency has  revised the Outlook on E.ON's Long-term IDR to Negative.   Developments on Nuclear Fuel Tax   In 2013 the Hamburg Fiscal Court referred the nuclear fuel tax to the German  Constitutional Court and the European Court of Justice, raising expectations  that the law enacting the tax may contravene the German constitution and/or  European directives. On 14 April 2014 the Hamburg Fiscal Court ruled that E.ON  be provisionally refunded for EUR1.7bn in nuclear fuel tax already paid (for the  2011-13 period). An appeal by the government is legally possible and the  decision by the Hamburg Fiscal Court to uphold E.ON's motion for refunding does  not give any further insights as to how the German Constitutional Court or the  European Court of Justice will rule. Hence, the tax burden remains for the time  being and Fitch will treat any refunded tax payments as restricted cash.  Well Diversified Business Profile The group has a well-diversified profile with network and retail activities  across Europe, conventional and renewables generation across various  jurisdictions, upstream oil and gas interests in Russia and the North Sea,  investments into several emerging markets as well as trading operations that can  rely on some infrastructure assets. Regulated and quasi-regulated earnings from  grids and renewables are expected to represent around 50% of the total in the  medium term, contributing to an overall strong business profile.  Government Intervention Remains a Threat European governments have imposed a variety of additional taxes, regulatory  requirements and other measures on utilities in the recent past. The political  debate to find a balance between budget consolidation and economically  sustainable energy policies remains an ongoing and uncertain process. E.ON's  operations have a high degree of diversification across countries, business  segments and technology of generation plant. Therefore, E.ON has a lower  exposure to potential government intervention than most of its peers.  Continued Investment Discipline  Management has guided towards a lower level of normalised investment activity of  around EUR4bn in the medium term, focusing on maintenance of existing assets and  selected growth projects with sound earnings and return visibility.   LIQUIDITY E.ON's liquidity continues to be strong. As of 31 December 2013, the group held  EUR4bn of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, around EUR2.6bn of short-term  securities and fixed income deposits and EUR5bn of committed, undrawn credit  facilities with a maturity in November 2018. Also, the group expects to complete  disposals in Sweden, Denmark and the Czech Republic in 2014 for a consideration  of around EUR700m.  The group has debt maturities of around EUR6.5bn-EUR7bn in 2014 and 2015.  Negative free cash flow (FCF) in 2014 is expected to be covered by disposal  proceeds and management guidance points towards positive FCF from 2015. Hence,  the current funding position should be sufficient to sustain the group into  2016. E.ON also has available another EUR3.8bn of longer-term fixed income securities,  which are liquid investments, but do not qualify as cash and cash equivalents  under Fitch methodology.RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - Lease- and nuclear- adjusted FFO net leverage materially above 3.75x and/or  corresponding fixed charge cover materially below 4x on a sustained basis - Increase in business risk, for example corporate activity or management  loosening investment discipline related to capital expenditure or significant  cash flow generation from emerging markets and upstream oil and gas  Positive: Future developments that could lead to a positive rating action  include:  -Lease- and nuclear- adjusted FFO net leverage at or below 3.75x and  corresponding fixed charge cover above 4.0x on a sustained basis - A court decision leading to the cancellation of the nuclear fuel tax
