NEW YORK, April 23 (Reuters) - Foreigners bought the lowest amount of U.S. 10-year Treasuries notes at auction in a year, according to Treasury Department data released on Wednesday.

Overseas investors purchased $2.659 billion or 12.7 percent of the $21 billion of the benchmark 10-year notes the Treasury offered on April 9, the data showed. The amount was below the $4.227 billion they bought in March and the lowest since the $1.670 billion they bought a year ago. At this month's 10-year auction, the Treasury Department sold the 10-year supply at a yield of 2.72 percent <US10YT=RR>, the lowest yield since October. [ID:nZXN0D5700]
