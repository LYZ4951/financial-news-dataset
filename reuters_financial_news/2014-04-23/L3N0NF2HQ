HONG KONG, April 23 (Reuters) - The pilot economic zone in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen said it will auction four parcels of land next month, and set specific business and revenue criteria on bidders for each parcel of land for the first time.

The Qianhai economic zone said on Wednesday it is planning to auction a total of around 582,000 square metres of land for a combined 5.7 billion yuan ($913.83 million) on May 22. Bidders for one parcel of land have to be a listed internet company, with annual revenue above 40 billion yuan, Qianhai authority said, while bidders for another parcel have to be a private equity fund company with over $4 billion of assets under management. Bidders for the other two parcels of land are both required to be ecommerce or IT-related companies. Focused on finance, logistics and IT services, the Qianhai Bay economic zone, an hour by car from Hong Kong, hopes to draw on the financial centre's expertise as a hub for the renminbi, or offshore yuan, as it seeks to provide the same services in renminbi, bond and equity offerings, insurance products and trade settlement.
