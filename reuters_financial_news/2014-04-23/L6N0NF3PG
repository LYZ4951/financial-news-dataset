MADRID, April 23 (Reuters) - Spanish bank Caixabank <CABK.MC> will report first quarter net profit of 162 million euros ($223.50 million), halved from the same period last year when results were swollen by one-off income from the purchase of state-rescued Banco de Valencia, according to a Reuters poll of analysts.

The bank will report on Thursday before market open. The poll consists of simple averages of forecasts and is in millions of euros.
