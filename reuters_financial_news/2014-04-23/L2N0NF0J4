April 23 (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.TO>, which made a $47 billion unsolicited offer for competitor Allergan Inc. <AGN.N> on Tuesday, said during an interview on CNBC that he was "disappointed" with Allergan's so-called poison pill.

Allergan on Tuesday night said that its board of directors had adopted a one-year stockholder rights plan to give it more time to consider takeover proposals. The Valeant offer was made with Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund, which built up a stake in the company.
