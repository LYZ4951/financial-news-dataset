HANOI, April 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.53 percent at the break on Wednesday in low volume as many investors stayed on the sidelines, waiting for more corporate news, an analyst said.

Banks lead the rise, with shares in Vietcombank <VCB.HM> climbing 0.69 percent, followed by Sacombank <STB.HM> with a 3.59 percent advance. Food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> gained 2.7 percent. "Shares of companies with good performance results in the first quarter of this year rose slowly as many investors have been awaiting more supportive news," said analyst Vu Thi Thu Trang at Asia-Pacific Securities. Volume hit 39 million shares by midday, far below the five-day average of 93 million, Reuters data showed. Shares in Vietnam's top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM>, dropped 0.77 percent to 38,700 dong ($1.83) each. Police have launched investigation against the former chief executive and two senior officials of the insurance firm for wrongdoing in management, causing losses to the state, the Hanoi police-run Capital Security newspaper reported on Wednesday.
