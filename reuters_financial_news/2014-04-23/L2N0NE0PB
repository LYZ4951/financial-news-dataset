SAO PAULO, April 23 (Reuters) - Private-sector lenders Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA likely posted the strongest set of first-quarter results among Brazil's largest listed banks, after fully incorporating the impact of higher borrowing costs into earnings, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.

After three years of downward pressure on interest margins amid mounting competition, quarterly data may show both banks finally regained pricing power, the poll of analysts said. In recent months, competition from state-run Banco do Brasil SA <BBAS3.SA> receded, allowing Itaú and its private-sector peers to raise lending rates from record lows seen early in 2013. The central bank's year-long plan to increase the benchmark Selic rate to combat inflation allowed Itaú <ITUB4.SA> and Bradesco <BBDC4.SA> to charge higher interest rates for most loan segments even though demand for credit had a downbeat start to the year, the poll found.  Itaú and Bradesco "were more exposed to these trends than others, and that will become clear during the earnings season," said Carlos Macedo, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Banco do Brasil, Itaú, Bradesco and Banco Santander Brasil SA <SANB11.SA> kept growing in less-risky, lower-yielding segments such as mortgages and payroll loans to fend off lending risk. The four banks also stepped up cross-selling - or the sale of financial services such as insurance and card products tied to checking and savings accounts - during the quarter, helping bolster profits, the poll found. However, the room for additional margin expansion stemming from a higher Selic is smaller than in prior tightening cycles, analysts said. Spreads, or the difference between a bank's lending and deposit rates, probably fell at Banco do Brasil and Santander Brasil in the quarter, a sign both banks are worried about potential market share losses. Banks grew their loan books at a tepid pace in the quarter, reflecting sluggish economic growth and faster inflation. The seventh quarterly drop in defaults failed to translate into lower loan-loss provisions, except for at Itaú. The earnings-reporting season for Brazilian banks starts on Thursday, when Bradesco announces results before markets open. Itaú and Santander Brasil will publish earnings on April 29, and Banco do Brasil will report on May 7. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  TABLE on first-quarter bank results:  [ID:nL2N0NE12L] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Investors will keep an eye on details of loan book growth, margin and provisions trends. Better-than-expected performance at Itaú and Bradesco could extend recent gains in their stock prices, while those of Santander Brasil may slip if earnings underperform for another quarter, analysts said. Bradesco is expected to post the largest gain in recurring net income, or profit excluding one-time items, at 5.8 percent, the poll showed. Recurring profit at Itaú fell 2.9 percent in the period, but analysts are likely to forgive the slide after record profit in the fourth quarter. Itaú outperformed peers in other first-quarter indicators. The São Paulo-based bank was the only one that saw loan defaults fall in the quarter. The decline in defaults helped trigger a 4.7 percent reduction in loan-loss provisions - making Itaú the only bank in the poll that cut such expenses. Bradesco was also the only bank among Brazil's big four listed lenders that managed to boost return on equity, a gauge of profitability that measures how well banks spend shareholder money, the poll showed. Bradesco's ROE, as the gauge is known, rose to 18.8 percent in the first quarter, compared with 18 percent in the previous three months, the poll showed.
