April 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says the French National Consumer Credit  Register would only have had a limited positive impact if adopted. The French Constitutional Council ruling that a National Consumer Credit  Register (NCCR) would be unconstitutional is credit neutral as Fitch expected  its impact to be limited as: (i) the NCCR would not have included residential  loans and inactive revolving loans, (ii) the NCCR would only have been an  additional element in assessing a borrower's repayment capacity as part of the  lenders' underwriting process and (iii) over-indebtedness is concentrated on  high-risk products such as revolving loans, the proportion of which is limited  in French ABS transactions. After several attempts to create a NCCR in France, the French Constitutional  Council recently blocked the latest proposal due to its unconstitutionality.  This decision is motivated by the extent of the register (more than 12 million  individuals), the length of conservation of the data (the whole credit tenor),  as well as the number of employees having access to the register (potentially  tens of thousands of credit institutions' employees), which would have  represented a threat to privacy rights in France. The NCCR would have recorded all consumer loans contracted by individuals in  France. This could have strengthened consumer protection against  over-indebtedness and made credit institutions accountable for their  underwriting practices. However, the NCCR would have excluded revolving credit  facilities inactive for more than one year as well as residential loans. In  addition, according to the Banque de France, 81% of the files accepted by the  over-indebtedness commissions as of 4Q13 also included other debts (rents, tax,  energy and telecom bills), not captured in the NCCR. More importantly,  over-indebtedness is often the result of passive indebtedness (i.e. the loss of  employment, sickness, divorce or death) and only to a limited extent of active  indebtedness (i.e. the result of too many loans). The NCCR could also have had a positive impact on underwriting quality, as more  extensive and more reliable data would have been available to lenders (limiting  false declarations or fraud for instance). However, Fitch notes that an  applicant's repayment capacity is already assessed and checked as part of the  underwriting process through bank account statements verification (usually  required to check resources and existing indebtedness) and the mandatory  consultation of the Fichier National des Incidents de Remboursement de Credits  aux Particuliers (a national register which records all late or missed payments  under any loans granted to individuals).
