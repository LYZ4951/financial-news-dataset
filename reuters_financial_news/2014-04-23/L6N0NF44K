WARSAW, April 23 (Reuters) - Poland's fourth largest bank, mBank <MBK.WA>, is expected to report a 3-percent rise in its first-quarter net profit, mostly due to lower price it pays for deposits and higher net interest income, a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday.

mBank, which is controlled by German lender Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, may report a net profit of 334 million zlotys ($110 million) in the first quarter of this year according to the average of forecasts given by seven banks and brokerages. Poland's central bank lowered interest rates by 1.5 percentage points to 2.5 percent in 2013, their lowest level in history, to help revive a sluggish economy.
