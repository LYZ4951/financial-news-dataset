April 23 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Banco Angolano de Investimentos (BAI) a Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B+' and a Viability Rating (VR) of 'b'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR is Stable. A Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF), respectively of '4' and 'B+'  have also been assigned. A full list of rating actions is provided at the end of  this rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, SR AND SRF The bank's IDRs, SR and SRF reflect a limited probability of support from the  Angolan authorities (BB-/Stable), if required. Fitch believes that propensity to  support the bank is high, given BAI's market position as one of the country's  leading banks. However, the authorities' ability to support BAI is constrained  by the sovereign rating.  The Stable Outlook on the Long-term IDR reflects that on Angola's sovereign  rating.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SR AND SRF The bank's IDRs, SR and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's view of the  willingness or ability of the Angolan authorities to provide support for BAI.  The ratings could be upgraded if the Angolan sovereign rating is upgraded.  However, this is not Fitch's current base case given the recent revision to  Stable from Positive of the Outlook on Angola's ratings (see 'Fitch Revises  Outlook on Angola to Stable; Affirms BB-' dated 11 April 2014, available at  www.fitchratings.com). A downgrade is also unlikely at the present time.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VR The bank's VR reflects the evolving operating environment in Angola, where the  financial markets and regulatory framework are in a development phase. The VR is  also driven by certain limitations inherent to the banking sector, notably high  concentrations in lending, funding and liquidity profiles. BAI's balance sheet  contains a high proportion of cash and government securities, but markets for  Angolan securities are not deep. In addition, the bank's deposit base is  concentrated and volatile, particularly in foreign exchange, exposing BAI's  funding base to event risk. The VR also considers BAI's loan book. Although the loan book represents a  relatively small proportion of the bank's balance sheet, loan quality displays  some weaknesses. The weak performance of the real estate sector (real estate and  construction represented 36% of lending at end-2013) is a source of risk and  single obligor concentration is high, although within prudential limits.  Related-party lending is significant, but not uncommon within the Angolan  banking sector. Loan impairment charges as a proportion of pre-impairment  operating profits were high at (71%) in 1H13, limiting the bank's capacity for  internal capital generation. BAI's earnings are predominantly generated through interest on corporate loans  and government securities. Following several years of consistently strong  returns, BAI's return on average equity declined to 8.7% in 1H13, marginally  above inflation.  BAI's capital ratios are calculated under the Basel I framework, which has been  adapted by local regulators, requiring additional capital charges for FX  exposure. The bank's Fitch Core Capital/Weighted risks ratio at end-1H13 was  15.1%, considered adequate by Fitch given the bank's asset profile.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VR The bank's VR is sensitive to developments in its operating environment. In  addition, the VR is sensitive to event risk given concentrations on both sides  of the balance sheet. While we believe the authorities would be supportive of  the bank, BAI is sensitive to a liquidity shock, given deposit concentrations,  should it not be able to access central bank liquidity for any reason.  Founded in 1996, BAI is the largest bank in Angola by total assets and total  deposits. BAI is predominantly a corporate bank, supplemented by retail and  private banking activities. The bank is supported by its treasury function which  manages BAI's liquidity. The bank owns subsidiaries in Portugal and Cape Verde and also has domestic  subsidiaries operating in microfinance and insurance. The domestic banking  operation, however, contributes the majority of operating income to the group. BAI's shares are widely owned. The largest shareholder is the state oil company  Sonangol, which owns 8.5% of the bank. The remaining shares are owned by  investment companies, directors of the bank and local investors.   The rating actions are as follows:  Banco Angolano de Investimentos Long-term IDR assigned at 'B+'; Outlook Stable Short-term IDR assigned at 'B' Viability Rating assigned at 'b' Support Rating assigned at '4'
