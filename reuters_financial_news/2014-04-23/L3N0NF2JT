TOKYO, April 23 (Reuters) - Japan's Asahi Life Insurance said on Wednesday that it plans to increase its foreign bond holdings for the fiscal year through March 2015 in a search for higher returns as domestic yields are stuck at low levels.

Asahi, with total assets of about 5.6 trillion yen ($54.6 billion), plans to keep investments in yen bonds unchanged for 2014/15, a senior official told Reuters in an interview. Japanese insurers collectively hold assets of over 180 trillion yen and their investment plans are closely watched by financial market players. "Because domestic bond yields are at low levels, we are looking to increase foreign bonds," said Takahiro Ono, general manager of Asahi Mutual Life Insurance. Asahi plans to increase its foreign bond portfolio by "tens of billions of yen" in the current year, after having raised the holding by 40 billion yen last financial year to around 250 billion yen, he added. Of that amount, about 60 percent is in U.S. debt, 30 percent in Europe and the remainder in Australia -- a makeup that Asahi wants to maintain in the current financial year. But the insurer could buy more European debt as it sees a risk of a fall in U.S. bond prices because of solid expansion in the U.S. economy. Asahi plans to maintain the ratio of currency hedging on its foreign bonds, about 90 percent at this point, but it consider reducing hedging on dollar bonds, as it expects the dollar to strengthen against the yen. The company sees the dollar rising to 110 yen by end of March, from around 102.50 yen now <JPY=>.   On the other hand, Asahi expects its domestic bond holdings, the core part of its portfolio, to be flat in the current financial year at around 3.0 trillion yen. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield <JP10YTN=JBTC> has been stuck around 0.6 percent in recent months, its lowest level expect for two short periods below that level, one in 2003 and the other in 2013, as a result of the Bank of Japan's massive bond purchase.
