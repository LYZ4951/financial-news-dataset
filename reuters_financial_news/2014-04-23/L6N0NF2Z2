MADRID, April 23 (Reuters) - Mid-sized Spanish lender Sabadell <SABE.MC> is expected to report first quarter net income more than double that of a year ago after integrating several acquisitions, according to the averaged forecasts of nine analysts polled by Reuters.

The bank, Spain's sixth biggest by market value, has bought several local peers throught the country's financial crisis, including bailed-out Banco Gallego, which began to contribute to earnings in the first quarter of 2014. Like many peers, Sabadell's net interest income (NII), which tracks earnings on loans minus funding costs, is also expected to grow compared to the first quarter of 2013, as deposit costs fall. Analysts forecast NII would rise just over 13 percent to 512 million euros ($706 million) in the period, according to their averaged predictions. The poll put net profit at 83.2 million euros, up 63 percent on the first quarter of 2013.Sabadell is due to report first quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday.Following are the results of the poll in simple averages and millions of euros:
