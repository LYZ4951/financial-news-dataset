SINGAPORE April 23 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd <SGXL.SI> reported a 22 percent fall in net profit on Wednesday, hit by a continued slide in share trading volumes, though a steady performance by its derivatives, listings and market data businesses meant it fared better than analysts expected.

SGX posted a net profit of S$75.8 million ($60.33 million) for the March quarter, above the S$73.8 million average of five analysts polled by Reuters.  The exchange, Asia's third largest listed bourse by market value, has been hit by a slide in securities trading volumes following a penny stock crash last October. In March, the volume of securities traded on the exchange was 25 percent lower than a year ago.  Since that crash the bourse and Singapore's central bank have proposed a series of reforms to try and improve liquidity in the market and reduce the prevalence of penny stocks by raising the minimum share price for a company listed on its main market. [ID:nL3N0LC3LT] Revenue from share trading and other listed-securities was 32 percent lower than a year ago at S$52.3 million, while derivatives was down 2 percent to S$52.3 million.  "We are confident that our securities market will recover over time and we remain committed to our long term growth strategies," the exchange said in its outlook statement
