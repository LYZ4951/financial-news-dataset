LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Britain's largest pawnbroker H&T <HTGR.L> said on Monday it had ended talks with the administrators of its smaller rival Albemarle & Bond <ALBH.L> about buying some of the chain's assets.

H&T submitted a proposal to the administrators of Albemarle & Bond  a week ago. [ID:nFWN0MV01B] Albemarle, which was hit by the fall of gold after it expanded heavily in 2011, put itself up for sale in December, but was unable to find a buyer. The company provides short-term loans to individuals and small businesses against items such as watches and jewellery and also buys gold.
