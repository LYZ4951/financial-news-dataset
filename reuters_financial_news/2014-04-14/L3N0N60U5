April 14 (Reuters) - Blackstone <BX.N> and Goldman Sachs' <GS.N> investment arm are set to buy Ipreo from KKR <KKR.N> in a private equity secondary deal that values the data company at $975 million, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

The deal could be announced as early as Monday, the newspaper said. (http://r.reuters.com/qyb58v) The planned sale, coming barely three years after KKR acquired Ipreo for $425 million, reflects the trend for private equity groups to flip assets among themselves at a time when there are fewer fresh deals on the ground, the FT said. Ipreo was formed by the merger of i-Deal and Hemscott in 2006, with the backing of Veronis, Merrill Lynch and Citigroup.
