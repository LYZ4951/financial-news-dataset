BEIJING, April 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished slightly higher on Monday in subdued trade, with a strong performance from blue chips including Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd <0388.HK> pulling up the index.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 0.2 percent at 23,038.8. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was also up 0.2 percent.

Haitong Securities Co Ltd <6837.HK> dropped 2.7 percent while CITIC Securities Co Ltd <6030.HK> shed 2.4 percent.
