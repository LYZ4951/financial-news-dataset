April 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating to Platinum Trust - February 2014's pass-through certificates (PTCs) as follows: INR2,550.6m Series A PTCs due June 2018: 'BBB-sf'; Stable Outlook The rating addresses timely payment of interest and principal in accordance with  the scheduled payout in the transaction document. The distribution tax will be  deducted from the scheduled payout before the income is distributed by the trust  to the PTC holders. The transaction document has specified that the variation in  the scheduled payouts on account of deductions for the distribution tax shall  not amount to any PTC event of default.  The transaction is a static securitisation of Indian rupee-denominated  commercial vehicle loans originated by Cholamandalam Investment and Finance  Company Limited <CHLA.NS> (CIFCL), which is also the servicer.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating and outlook reflect adequate external credit enhancement (CE) of  10.0% of the initial principal balance, CIFCL's origination practices, servicing  experience and expertise in collection and recovery, as well as the sound legal  and financial structure of the transaction.  The CE is cash collateral in the form of fixed deposits with IDBI Bank Limited <IDBI.NS> (BBB-/Stable/F3) in the name of the originator with a lien marked in favour of  the trustee.   The credit enhancement is deemed sufficient to cover the commingling risk of the  servicer and the liquidity for the timely payment of the PTCs. India's economic situation has been factored into Fitch's analysis. The 2012  vintage had more delinquencies that were 90 or more days past due (90+ dpd) than  earlier and subsequent vintages as a result of unfavourable economic conditions  in 2012. The agency has considered the heightened economic risks in India in its  base-case default-rate assumptions. The default rate, recovery rate and time to  recovery, together with the portfolio's weighted-average yield, were stressed in  Fitch's Asia-Pacific ABS cash flow model to assess the sufficiency of cash flow  for timely payment at the current rating level. Fitch has received the latest servicer report dated March 2014, and finds that  the 90+ dpd delinquencies have performed in line with other CIFCL's transactions  rated by Fitch at the same level of seasoning.   No interest-rate or foreign-currency risks exist in the transaction because both  the assets and the PTCs are fixed-rate and denominated in rupees. This portfolio has been assigned to the trust at par. The collateral pool  features only new vehicles and has a weighted-average (WA) seasoning of 15  months, with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of INR2,550.6m as of 31  January 2014. The pool consisted of 9,494 loans, had a WA loan-to-value ratio of  82.9%, and a WA yield of 14.6%. Loans for new light-commercial vehicles  accounted for about 82% of the pool, while the rest of the pool comprised loans  originated for new small-commercial vehicles. The portfolio is also  geographically diversified, and exposed to 15 Indian states in terms of obligor  composition.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Based on Fitch's sensitivity analysis, the base-case default would need to  increase by at least 21% from the current rate, or the base-case recovery rate  to decline by at least 35%, before a rating downgrade of the PTCs to 'BB+sf' is  considered. The rating-sensitivity analysis assumes that the CE and other  factors remain constant. The rating could be upgraded if the rating of the bank holding the cash  collateral is upgraded to above 'BBB-' and the portfolio performance remains  sound, with adequate CE that can withstand stress at above a 'BBB-sf' rating  scenario. CIFCL has assigned new commercial-vehicle loans to the trust, which in turn  issued the PTCs. The PTC proceeds were used to fund the purchase of the  underlying loans.
