HANOI, April 14 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> was down 0.21 percent at the mid-day break on Monday as investors turned cautious following recent declines, an analyst said.

Real-estate led the fall with Vingroup <VIC.HM> losing 0.72 percent and HAGL Co <HAG.HM> dipping 0.35 percent. Bank shares also dropped with Eximbank <EIB.HM> down 0.71 percent and Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, Vietnam's largest listed bank, falling 0.65 percent. "The trading volume, which was at a low level during past two weeks, pushed investor sentiment down," said analyst Nguyen Tuan at An Binh Securities. "Big investors might sell a large amount of shares this week as some stocks have already risen too much over their expected prices," Tuan added.
