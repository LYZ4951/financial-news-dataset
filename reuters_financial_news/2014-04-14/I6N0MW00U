MILAN, April 14 (Reuters) - Short-selling on the shares of Banca Popolare di Milano <PMII.MI> has been temporarily banned, the Italian market regulator said on Monday after the stock fell 8 percent following a rejection of governance reforms by its shareholders.

Consob said the ban would last until the end of Tuesday's trading session.
