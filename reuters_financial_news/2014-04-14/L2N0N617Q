SAN FRANCISCO, April 14 (Reuters) - U.S. venture funds raised $8.9 billion in the first quarter, the most in six years and almost double the amount raised the year before, underscoring the growing enthusiasm of investors for start-up companies.

It was the strongest showing since the 2007 fourth quarter, when venture firms raised $10.4 billion, according to the report from the National Venture Capital Association, based on Thomson Reuters data. Venture-capital research firm CB Insights reported last week that investments by venture-capital firms into start-ups hit $9.99 billion last quarter, more than any quarter since 2001. [ID:L2N0N12H3] Some 58 venture funds were raised during the first quarter, 10 more than a year earlier, the NVCA said. A hot market for initial public offerings and acquisitions is likely bolstering investor appetite for the sector. Earlier this month, the NVCA said venture capital-backed companies held 36 initial public offerings in the first quarter, more than any quarter for at least five years. [ID:nL1N0MU20L]  TCV, a late-stage investor based in Palo Alto, California, raised the largest fund of the quarter, the $1.38 billion TCV VIII. Founders Fund raised a $1.01 billion fund, Founders Fund V. Both firms backed social-networking company Facebook <FB.O>.
