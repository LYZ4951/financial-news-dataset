MILAN, April 14 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian cooperative lender Banca Popolare di Milano <PMII.MI> fell sharply on Monday after its shareholders unexpectedly rejected a governance reform aimed at luring new investors.

The reform proposal, which would have given institutional investors a greater say and limit the power of employee shareholders and union representatives, was rejected by a shareholder meeting on Saturday.
