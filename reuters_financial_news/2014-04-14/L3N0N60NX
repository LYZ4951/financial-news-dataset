SEOUL, April 14 (Reuters) - Seoul shares ended flat on Monday as a rally in technology stocks offset weak leads from Wall Street, while the won <KRW=> snapped a four-day gaining streak on dollar short-covering and caution over strong remittance outflows.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.02 percent at 1,997.02 points. Foreign investors sold a net 22.8 billion won ($22 million) worth of KOSPI shares, Korea Exchange preliminary data showed. If the figures hold, foreigners would be snapping a 13-day net buying streak which brought their total purchases for the period to a net 3.00 trillion won. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,038.9 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, down 0.4 percent from Friday's close at 1,035.0. The won appreciated almost 2 percent during the four-day winning streak, breaching the 1,050 threshold, a level that had not been breached until then since August 2008.
