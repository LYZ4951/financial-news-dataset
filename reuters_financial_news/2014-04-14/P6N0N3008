PARIS, April 14 (Reuters) - European stocks fell extended last week's retreat on Monday after late losses on Wall Street and as tensions in Ukraine flared again.

By 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.4 percent at 1,308.17 points, having fallen 3 percent last week. Ukraine gave pro-Russian separatists a Monday morning deadline to disarm or face a "full-scale anti-terrorist operation" by its armed forces, while the UN's Security Council held an emergency session on Sunday night to discuss the crisis.
