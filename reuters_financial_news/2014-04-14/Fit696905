April 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned France-based SGD Group SAS  (SGD Pharma) an expected Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B(EXP)' with  Stable Outlook. Fitch has concurrently assigned the group's upcoming issue of  EUR335m senior secured notes an expected 'B(EXP)' rating.  The assignment of the final ratings is contingent on the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already received. Failure to refinance the  existing debt with the proposed notes issue according to plan would result in  the withdrawal of the ratings. The ratings are based solely on the pharma business of SGD Group and exclude the  perfumery business, which is being demerged from the group, with expected  completion by end-2015. The ratings are also based on our assumption that the  legal separation of the pharma and perfumery businesses will mostly be completed  at the time of the notes issue, that SGD Pharma will continue to pay for the  operational costs of the perfumery business until separation is complete and  that the shareholder, Oaktree Capital, will provide credit support for any  indemnity.  The ratings reflect SGD Pharma's limited scale of its operations and fairly high  funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage, which we forecast to remain at  around 5.5x. However, the group's credit profile is supported by leading  positions in the stable pharma glass packaging market, high barriers to entry  and limited end-market and customer concentration.   KEY RATING DRIVERS High Leverage Leverage is high, but adequate for the ratings. FCF generation over the next two  years will be limited by large investment outlays of EUR75m. We expect the group  to be FCF positive from 2016, when it completes the separation of its perfumery  and pharma operations and capex returns to normalised levels.   Sound Business Profile SGD Pharma's business profile is commensurate with the 'B' rating category. The  limited scale of its operations and focus on the pharmaceutical glass market are  mitigated by a range of therapeutic end-markets served by its products. In  addition, customer concentration is limited, eliminating dependency on the  success of single drugs, formats or customers.  Stable End-Markets The molded glass packaging market has been growing at healthy rates of around 4%  since the 2009 recession. We expect long-term favourable demand growth for  pharma packaging, driven by global growth in population, life expectancy,  chronic diseases and fast-growing demand for healthcare and pharma in emerging  markets.   Strong Market Positions SGD Pharma has strong market positions, particularly in the profitable type I  glass market, where it holds a 30% global share. The market for this type of  glass is highly concentrated, with the top three players supplying 80% of the  market. In its core western European markets (63% of revenues), the group is the  undisputed leader in type II and III glass markets  with a 55% and 33% share,  respectively.  High Barriers to Entry The group's profitability is protected in the short- to medium-term by high  entry barriers provided by its technological leadership, the large investments  required to set up new production and high switching costs for customers,  including high regulatory requirements and the reputational risks associated  with product quality issues. For SGD Pharma's customers, switching suppliers is  therefore often not economical, given that the price of packaging is small  compared with the price of the final product. It amounts to up to 3% for type I  glass and up to 5% for type II glass.  Refurbished Asset Base The group's assets benefit from large historical investments. This will enable  the group to reduce maintenance capex for a number of years, particularly during  the construction of its new French plant and the operational separation of its  pharma and perfumery businesses, which is capital-intensive.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - FFO adjusted leverage below 4.0x - Positive FCF generation through the cycle  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - FFO adjusted leverage above 6.0x - Quality issues, operational disruptions or growing competitive pressure in  type II or III markets, resulting in EBITDA margin in the teens - Liquidity pressures from negative FCF or covenant breaches  LIQUIDITY
