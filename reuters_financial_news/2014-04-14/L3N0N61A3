KUALA LUMPUR, April 14 (Reuters) - Malaysia's largest asset manager Permodalan Nasional Bhd has partnered with Tokyo-based Inspire Corp to form Japan's first fund devoted to investing in Malaysian sharia-compliant firms.

PNB-Inspire Ethical Fund will start with 4.95 billion yen ($48.70 million) and identify small-to-medium sized Japanese firms with potential for expanding to Islamic markets in ASEAN, according to a statement by Inspire Corp.  It hopes to rope in more regional banks to grow to 6 billion yen ($59.03 million) by the end of the year. Japan's Oita Bank <8392.T> and Hiroshima Bank <8379.T> are listed as limited partners for the fund. Islamic finance is emerging as a popular entry point for global firms to tap into the growth of Muslim-majority countries within Asia. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, a unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group <8316.T>, last month established an Islamic finance arm in Malaysia to capture demand for sharia-compliant loans within Southeast Asia [ID:T9N0L503J].
