April 14 (Reuters) - China-focused hospital operator Chindex International Inc <CHDX.O> received a buyout offer of $23 per share, higher than the $19.50 offered by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group <600196.SS> and private equity firm TPG in February.

Chindex, which runs the United Family Healthcare hospitals in China, did not name the new bidder. [ID:nPnbSkK2d] The latest offer represents a 23 percent premium to Chindex's Friday close on the Nasdaq and values the company at $416 million, based on 18.1 million outstanding shares as of March 11.  Chindex's shares were trading at $22.89 on Monday morning. In February, Shanghai Fosun and TPG agreed to take Chindex private to gain access to China's fast-growing private healthcare market. [ID:nL2N0LN00W] Chindex said on Monday that the latest offer constitutes a "superior proposal," as per the company's earlier agreement with the buyout group led by Shanghai Fosun and TPG.
