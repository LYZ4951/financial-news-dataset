April 13 (Reuters) - Hong Kong brokerage CLSA, owned by Citic Securities <600030.SS>, has made an undisclosed investment in BTIG LLC, a fast-growing institutional broker-dealer formed by former executives of Speer Leeds Kellogg and Montgomery Securities, BTIG said on Sunday.

Proceeds from the investment will help the company grow its core business and expand into new areas, BTIG said. It will continue operating as an independent firm. BTIG was co-founded in 2002 by Steve Starker of SLK, a major Wall Street trading firm acquired by Goldman Sachs Group, and Scott Kovalik of Montgomery. In 2008 Goldman Sachs became an investor.
