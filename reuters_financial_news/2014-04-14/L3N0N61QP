HANOI, April 14 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> extended losses to a third straight session on Monday and ended down 0.74 percent, led by a fall in blue-chips as investors turned cautious.

Most blue-chips in the banking sector fell with Eximbank <EIB.HM> dropping 1.42 percent, Vietcombank <VCB.HM> losing 0.97 percent and Vietinbank <CTG.HM> down 0.6 percent. PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's biggest listed company by market capitalisation, ended down 0.53 percent after hitting a record high close of 94,500 dong ($4.48) on Friday. While the market had risen strongly in the past three months, a lack of positive news has led to slower cash flow into the market, said Doan Thi Anh Nguyet, an analyst at Saigon-Hanoi Securities.
