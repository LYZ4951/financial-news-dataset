VIENNA, April 14 (Reuters) - Vienna prosecutors are investigating several people close to the ousted Ukrainian government on suspicion of money-laundering and  sanctions violations, Austrian law enforcement officials said.

The Austrian justice ministry said "numerous" persons were being investigated over money-laundering and other crimes, including former Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his son Oleksii. "The justice ministry has asked Ukraine's public prosecutor to submit a letter of request in which it would make its suspicions more concrete," it said in a written answer to a parliamentary question from the NEOS party. A spokesman for the Vienna prosecutors' office declined to say who the other people under suspicion were. "There are currently investigations but I can't say against whom," he said on Monday. Switzerland's public prosecutor has also opened two formal money-laundering investigations into unnamed associates of toppled President Viktor Yanukovich, who is suspected of human rights abuses and misuse of state funds.
