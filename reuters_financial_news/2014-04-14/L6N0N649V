April 14 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc <BARC.L>, under fire from shareholders for raising bonuses despite a fall in profit, will appoint Crawford Gillies to its board on Tuesday, Sky News reported, citing sources.

Sky News said Gillies, who will join the bank as a non-executive director in the coming weeks, will take over chairmanship of the remuneration committee from John Sunderland later this year. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. The British bank angered some shareholders after raising its bonus payouts for staff by 10 percent last year, despite a one-third drop in profit, and pressure is building on Chief Executive Antony Jenkins to rein in pay at the bank.
