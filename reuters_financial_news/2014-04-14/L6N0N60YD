DUBAI, April 14 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Gulf Bank <GBKK.KW> missed analyst estimates despite reporting a 10 percent increase in first-quarter net profit on Monday.

The country's fourth-largest lender by assets said net profit for the three months to the end of March was 8.73 million dinars ($31.1 million), compared to 7.94 million dinars in the same period a year ago. Analysts at Global Research and Arqaam Capital had forecast a net profit in the period of 9 million and 10 million dinars respectively. [ID:nL6N0N01A5]
