April 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed German Residential  Funding 2013-1 Limited's (GRF 2013-1) ratings, as follows: EUR1,235.1m class A due August 2024 (ISIN XS0944452563): affirmed at 'AAAsf';  Outlook Stable EUR238m class B due August 2024 (ISIN XS0944452993): affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook  Stable EUR136m class C due August 2024 (ISIN XS0944453967): affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook  Stable EUR272m class D due August 2024 (ISIN XS0944454858): affirmed at 'BBBsf';  Outlook Stable EUR102m class E due August 2024 (ISIN XS0944455152): affirmed at 'BBB-sf';  Outlook Stable  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect stable operating performance since the notes' issue in  June 2013, reinforced by stable demand for low-risk income streams, such as that  generated by well-managed German MFH (multi-family housing) assets. Residential  vacancy has been stable at just above 5%, and remains in line with Fitch's  expectations at closing. This is supported by continued growth of the large  German cities, where around half of the assets are located. Irrecoverable costs, a key driver of operating margins, remain at around 40% of  net cold rent (rental net of recoverable items), in line with other comparable  diversified MFH portfolios. Higher capital expenditure for modernisation and  energy efficiency may temporarily increase the cost ratio, but investment in the  maintenance of the buildings is favourable for value and occupancy over the long  term. Fitch expects investor appetite for well-managed German MFH portfolios to remain  strong in 2014, following record sales volume in 2013 since the previous peak in  2007. Fitch expects the portfolio's market value will be supported over the  medium term by strong interest from investors drawn by the portfolio's stable  cash flows derived from a highly granular tenant base.RATING SENSITIVITY Any disruption in the management of the portfolio or a sharp economic decline in  the regions represented in the portfolio could prompt downgrades or revisions of  the Outlooks to Negative.
