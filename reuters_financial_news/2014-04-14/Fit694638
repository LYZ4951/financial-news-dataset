April 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned ADIF Alta Velocidad's (ADIF AV; BBB/F2/Stable), Spanish high speed rail infrastructure administrator, proposed EUR3bn EMTN programme expected   ratings of 'BBB(EXP)'.  The EMTN programme will be used for general corporate purposes and issues under  the programme will constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and  unsecured obligations of the ADIF AV.  The assignment of the final ratings on the programme is contingent upon the  receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. ADIF AV was created at end-December 2013 through Royal Decree 15/2013, after it  was segregated from ADIF (BBB/F2/Stable) (see 'Fitch:ADIF Split Neutral on  Credit Profile' dated 19 December 2013). The existing ADIF is responsible for  the conventional rail network in Spain and receives state subsidies, while ADIF  AV is responsible for the maintenance and expansion of the high speed rail  network.  KEY RATING DRIVERS ADIF AV's ratings are equalised with those of Spain's Issuer Default Rating  (BBB/Stable/F2). This reflects the entity's public sector legal status and  strong operational and strategic ties with the government, resulting in a high  likelihood of extraordinary government support if needed. ADIF AV is therefore  classified as a dependent public sector entity under Fitch's criteria.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
