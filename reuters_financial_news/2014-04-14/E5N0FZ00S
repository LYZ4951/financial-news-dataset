RIO DE JANEIRO, April 14 (Reuters) - The global private equity industry will see more listed players in coming years, focus more on emerging markets while depending less on leverage, and more on good management of their investments, a senior industry executive said on Monday.

Buyout firms will have to focus on "value creation," or an active management to enhance returns on their investments, said David Rubenstein, co-chief executive officer of Carlyle Group LP, one of the U.S. largest private-equity firms.
