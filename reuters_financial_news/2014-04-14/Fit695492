April 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that a small group of banks in the European Union will continue to have state support factored into their ratings due to specific forms of state sponsorship for each of them, according to two new reports.  Fitch would continue to factor support into the ratings of some banks for three  main reasons: they have a specific, recognised policy role; they are in orderly  run-down under state ownership or sponsorship; or the state is a long-term  strategic investor, as is the case, for example, with the German Landesbanken.  A considerable proportion of German banks' ratings benefit from state support  and are likely to continue to do so. Of 23 banking groups based in Germany and  rated by Fitch, 19 have Issuer Default Ratings based on state support. Fitch is  likely to retain some degree of support consideration in 15 of these, and has  therefore published a separate report on support for German banks. The EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution  Mechanism for Banking Union countries are scheduled to be voted on in the  European Parliament on 15 April. Once incorporated into national laws and  regulations they will make extraordinary support for senior creditors in banks  less likely.  Fitch highlighted in March that weakening sovereign support mostly affects EU  and US banks (see "Sovereign Support for Banks Rating Path Expectations"  available at www.fitchratings.com). The new reports expand on rating reviews in  March announced in "Fitch Revises Outlooks on 18 EU State-Sponsored Banks to  Negative on Weakening Support", dated 26 March, which accompanied a series of  other rating actions around the globe.
