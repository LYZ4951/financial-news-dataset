LAGOS, April 14 (Reuters) - Nigerian naira <NGN=D1> traded flat against the U.S. dollar on Monday as lenders sold dollars on the interbank market to improve liquidity, shoring up the weakening local currency, dealers said.

The naira had initially weakened to 161.30 in mid-day trade before some lenders started to sell the greenback on behalf of offshore clients participating the bond market. In addition,  the local unit of Addax <SASAAP.UL> sold $10 million. The move helped the naira recover to close flat at 161.05 naira, compared with Friday's close of 161 naira. "We don't expect any major move in the naira this week as demand slows and offshore dollar flows into the market," one dealer said, noting that the unit could trade around 160-161.50 naira throughout the week.
