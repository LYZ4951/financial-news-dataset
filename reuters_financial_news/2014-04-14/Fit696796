April 14 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings  and Rating Outlooks to Kubota Credit Owner Trust 2014-1:  --$62,100,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf'; --$93,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$94,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$50,900,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.  Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in Fitch's presale  report, 'Kubota Credit Owner Trust 2014-1', published today and available at  'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the below link.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Quality of Receivables: For the 81% of the pool with FICO scores, the obligors  have strong credit quality, as evidenced by the WA FICO of 741 for the 2014-1  pool. Additionally, the majority of the 2014-1 pool (approximately 87%) consists  of new AG equipment, which is the strongest performing collateral type. The  2014-1 pool is also diversified in terms of geographic concentrations and has  limited exposure to obligor concentrations. Strong Managed Portfolio: Kubota Credit Corporation's managed portfolio has  experienced consistent and low levels of delinquencies and net losses dating  back to 2008. As static pool data from a recessionary period were not available,  Fitch supplemented the KCC data with proxy data from prime auto loan issuers  with similar FICO composition on the consumer portion (81%) of the pool and John  Deere and CNH Capital proxy data for the commercial portion (19%) of 2014-1 to  derive an expected base case cumulative net loss (CNL). Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 2014-1 is 4% for  the class A notes. The transaction also benefits from expected excess spread of  2.02% per annum (p.a.). Based on Fitch's stressed cash flow scenarios, the  structure can support 6.62% in net loss coverage under a 1.30% base case proxy.  This results in loss multiples in excess of 5.0x, consistent with an 'AAAsf'  rating for the class A notes.Quality Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing Platform: KCC has demonstrated  adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by  historical delinquency and net loss performance of the managed portfolio.  Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should  provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of  payments on the securities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on  defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and  could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the  sensitivity of the ratings assigned to KCOT 2014-1 to increased CNL over the  life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays  some sensitivity to increased defaults and CNL, showing a potential downgrade of  one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes  could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories, although still  remain investment grade, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.  Key rating drivers and rating rensitivities are further detailed in the  accompanying pre-sale report.  Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction  can be found in 'Kubota Credit Owner Trust 2014-1 - Appendix'. These R&W are  compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in Fitch's  April 17, 2012 special report, 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement  Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions'.
