BANGKOK, July 15 (Reuters) - Indonesian stocks rose on Tuesday as battered large-caps rebounded ahead of the official results of the presidential election next week while commodity-related shares fell across the region amid weakness in crude oil markets. [O/R]

Shares of Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> and Kalbe Farma <KLBF.JK>, which had been hit by profit-taking since Friday, saw good buying activity. The Jakarta composite index <.JKSE> was up 0.5 percent at midday. Optimism around a possible win for Jakarta Governor Joko "Jokowi" Widodo, seen as more market friendly, sent stocks to an over-13-month high on Thursday, a day after the election. Investors sold the overbought market on Friday and Monday as some caution remained over the vote count, with rival candidate former general Prabowo Subianto also announcing a victory. [ID:nL4N0PM137] "We continue to suggest buying on weakness ahead of the KPU's (the Elections Commission) official announcement on presidential election on July 22," analysts at broker Trimegah Securities wrote in a market strategy report. Shares of palm plantation firms and energy companies were among the weak spots in Southeast Asia, with Malaysian palm oil futures falling to a more than nine-month low in line with weak oil prices. [POIL][O/R] Indonesia's palm plantation firm Astra Agro Lestari <AALI.JK> hit a three-month low, Singapore's Keppel Corp <KPLM.SI> pulled back after gains over the past three days and Thailand's PTT <PTT.BK> fell almost 1 percent at one point. Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> inched 0.2 percent lower at midday amid technical-led selling after 12 consecutive days of gains. Singapore <.FTSTI> and the Philippines <.PSI> were range-bound while Vietnam's <.VNI> blue-chips traded mostly higher ahead of the earnings season. [ID:nL4N0PQ1D0] Malaysia is shut for a market holiday and will reopen on Wednesday. Asian shares rose on Tuesday after Citigroup's earnings and a fresh round of merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. healthcare industry lifted global share prices. [MKTS/GLOB]
