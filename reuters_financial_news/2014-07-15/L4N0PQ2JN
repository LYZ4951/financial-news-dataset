BANGKOK, July 15 (Reuters) - Indonesia's key index rose on Tuesday, led by large cap banks, while Thai shares retreated from an over 13-month high as investors cashed in recent gainers after twelve straight days of gains.

Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> closed up about 1 percent after a combined 1.5 percent drop in the past two days. Shares of Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> and Bank Rakyat <BBRI.JK> led the rebound. A key market focus is the official result of the presidential election scheduled for July 22, according to brokers. Thai SET index <.SETI> eased 0.3 percent, trimming some of the 4.7 percent gain since June 25. The index closed at 1,524.53 on the day, retreating from Monday's close of 1,529.23, the highest since June 2013. Shares of Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> and PTT Global Chemical <PTTGC.BK> were among losers. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and the Philippines <.PSI> edged slightly higher, in line with Asian stock markets <.MIAPJ0000PUS>. Vietnam <.VNI> added 0.5 percent. [ID:nL4N0PQ2KJ]
