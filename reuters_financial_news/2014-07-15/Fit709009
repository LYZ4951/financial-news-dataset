July 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned China Huarong Asset Management Co., Ltd's (China Huarong; A/Stable) USD1.2bn 4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and USD300m 3% senior unsecured notes due 2017 final ratings of 'A'. The proceeds will be used as working capital and for general corporate purposes.   The assignment of the final ratings follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final ratings are in line with the expected  ratings assigned on 4 July 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - US Dollar Senior Unsecured Notes The notes, to be issued by Huarong Finance Co., Ltd., are to be unconditionally  and irrevocably guaranteed by Huarong (HK) International Holdings Limited  (Huarong Hong Kong), a wholly owned subsidiary of China Huarong. In place of a guarantee, China Huarong has granted a keepwell deed and a deed of  equity interest purchase, investment and liquidity support undertaking to ensure  that the guarantor, Huarong Hong Kong, has sufficient assets and liquidity to  meet its obligations under the guarantee for the US dollar notes. The notes are rated at the same level as China Huarong's Issuer Default Rating  (IDR), given the strong link between Huarong Hong Kong and China Huarong and the  keepwell deed and the deed of equity interest purchase, investment and liquidity  support undertaking, which provide additional support and transfer the ultimate  responsibility of payment to China Huarong. In Fitch's opinion, both the keepwell deed and the deed of equity interest  purchase, investment and liquidity support undertaking signal a strong intention  from China Huarong to ensure that Huarong Hong Kong has sufficient funds to  honour the proposed debt obligations. The agency also believes China Huarong  intends to maintain its reputation and credit profile in the international  offshore market, and is unlikely to default on offshore obligations.  Additionally a default of Huarong Hong Kong could have significant negative  repercussions on China Huarong for any future offshore funding. China Huarong was established in 1999 and is one of four big asset management  companies approved and set up by the State Council to safeguard the country's  economic and financial stability  RATING SENSITIVITIES - US Dollar Senior Unsecured Notes
