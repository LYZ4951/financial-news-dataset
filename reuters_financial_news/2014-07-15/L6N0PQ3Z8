RIYADH, July 15 (Reuters) - Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, Saudi Arabia's largest listed lender, has trimmed its proposed cash dividend for the first half of 2014, after reporting lower profits earlier this week.

The bank has proposed paying 1 riyal ($0.27) per share for the six-month period to June 30, according to a bourse filing on Tuesday. This is below the 1.38 riyals per share the bank paid for the corresponding period of 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.
