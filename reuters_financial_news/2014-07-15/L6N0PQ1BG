COPENHAGEN, July 15 (Reuters) - Danish investment company Novo A/S said it bought hearing technology firm Sonion from Swedish private equity firm Altor, entering a market in which Denmark has been a major player for decades.

Sonion manufactures advanced miniature components such as high-end microphones and electromechanical components. Its applications are mainly for hearing aids but also in-ear earphones for musicians and electro-acoustic communication components for extreme environments. Together with U.S. listed Knowles <KN.N>, it controls a major portion of the global market for advanced micro-acoustics.   Sonion has over 3,200 employees and earned revenues of $154 million in 2013. Novo A/S did not disclose the purchase price. "Unlike private equity companies, we are long-term investors," Chief Executive Eivind Kolding told Reuters. The investment firm is the controlling shareholder in insulin maker Novo Nordisk <NOVOb.CO> and enzyme producer Novozymes <NZYMb.CO>, and a major shareholder in food ingredients maker Chr. Hansen Holding <CHRH.CO>. William Demant Holding <WDH.CO> and GN Store Nord <GN.CO> are among a group of Danish companies that supply half of the world's hearing aids.
