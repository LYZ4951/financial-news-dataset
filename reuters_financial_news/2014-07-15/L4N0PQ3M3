MUMBAI, July 15 (Reuters) - India's market regulator on Tuesday ordered five former executives of Satyam Computer Services <SATY.NS> to pay about 18.5 billion rupees ($307.72 million) because of alleged 'wrongful gains' in share transactions.

Satyam shocked investors in 2009 with revelations that the firm's profits had been overstated for years and assets falsified. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused the former Satyam executives of accruing illegal gains in share transactions through "fraudulent acts, omissions and illegal transactions."
