BRASILIA, July 15 (Reuters) - Anatel, Brazil's telecommunications regulator, hopes Portugal Telecom SPGS SA <PTC.LS> does not have to reduce its stake in the new company that would result after its merger with Grupo Oi SA <OIBR3.SA>, the head of the agency said on Tuesday.

Anatel President João Rezende told reporters that such a move would require the regulator's approval, but he said he did not believe that would be a problem.
