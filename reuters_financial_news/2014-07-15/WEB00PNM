FARNBOROUGH, England, July 15 (Reuters) - BOC Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of Bank of China Ltd <601988.SS>, placed an order for 36 Airbus <AIR.PA> A320ceo and seven A320neo planes on Tuesday.

The lessor told a news conference at the Farnborough Airshow that 17 of the 43 planes would be a larger A321 version.  The first eight A320ceo aircraft will be powered by IAE engines, with decisions for the rest of the fleet to follow, Airbus said. IAE is part-owned by United Technologies Corp <UTX.N>. BOC Aviation Chief Executive Robert Martin added that Airbus was right to launch a revamped, more fuel-efficient version of its wide-body A330 aircraft, unveiled at the air show on Monday.
