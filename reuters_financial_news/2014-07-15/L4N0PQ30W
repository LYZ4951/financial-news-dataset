HANOI, July 15 (Reuters) - Malaysia's Public Bank Bhd <PUBM.KL> has agreed to buy from  Vietnamese lender BIDV <BID.HM> its stake in their $62.6 million Vietnam-based joint venture, BIDV said on Tuesday.

Representatives of both banks signed the deal in Hanoi, BIDV said in a statement. BIDV and Public Bank each hold 50 percent of VID Public Bank, the joint venture they set up in 1992. The statement did not give a value for the deal. It said Public Bank will seek the approval of the Vietnamese government to operate a bank that would be 100 percent foreign owned.
