LISBON, July 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Espirito Santo, Portugal's largest listed bank, fell more than 9 percent in early trade on Tuesday after the bank's founding family sold a stake in the bank.

Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESFG.LS> said Monday, after the market closed, that it had sold a 5 percent stake in the bank at 0.34 euros a share - below the current market price. At 0740 GMT shares in BES were 8.9 percent lower at 0.4050 euros a share, having fallen as low as 0.4000 euros. BES shares have been dumped by investors ever since a holding company of the Espirito Santo family found financial irregularities that raised the prospect of destabilising losses at the country's largest listed bank.
