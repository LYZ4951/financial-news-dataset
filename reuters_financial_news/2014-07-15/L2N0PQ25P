July 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett this week donated $2.8 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> stock to five charities, as part of the billionaire's plan to give away nearly all of his wealth.

Buffett donated about 21.73 million Class "B" shares of Berkshire on Monday, a regulatory filing shows. About 16.6 million shares, worth more than $2.1 billion, went to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on education, health and poverty problems. The remainder went to four family charities, including a foundation named for his late first wife Susan and foundations for his children Howard, Peter and Susan. The $2.8 billion is the most Buffett has donated to these charities, reflecting Berkshire's near-record share price, since he began making annual gifts in 2006. Buffett still controls nearly 20 percent of Berkshire's stock, which made him worth $65.8 billion on Monday, according to Forbes magazine. Only Mexico telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim and Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> co-founder and Berkshire director, were worth more, Forbes said.
