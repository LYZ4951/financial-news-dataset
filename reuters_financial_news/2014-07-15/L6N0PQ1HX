LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - European shares pulled back on Tuesday, with tech shares leading fallers after business software maker Software AG <SOWG.DE> cut its sales outlook.

Shares in the German firm fell nearly 14 percent after it said it now saw 2014 revenues from business process management products stagnating from a year earlier, denting sentiment on other software firms, such as SAP <SAPG.DE>, which was down 1 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> was down 0.2 percent at 1,361.32 points at 0704 GMT, pausing after an 0.8 percent increase in the previous session.
