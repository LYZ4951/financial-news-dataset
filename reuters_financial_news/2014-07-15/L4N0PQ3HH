July 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported an 8 percent decline in second-quarter profit as a pullback in trading of bonds and currencies by big institutions hit revenue in its securities trading business.

Net income fell to $5.99 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $6.5 billion, or $1.60 per share, in the same quarter of 2013. [ID:nBw8vBjXSa]
