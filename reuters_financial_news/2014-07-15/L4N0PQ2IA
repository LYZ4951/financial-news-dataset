BEIJING, July 15 (Reuters) - China Huarong Asset Management Co. has sold $1.5 billion of dollar-denominated bonds through its unit in Hong Kong, the company said on Tuesday, one of the biggest bond sales by Chinese financial institutions in overseas markets.

The bonds were sold on July 9 in two tranches. The first worth $300 million matures in three years and has a coupon of 3 percent, while the second tranche of $1.2 billion is due in five years and has a coupon of 4 percent, it said. The firm said the proceeds from the sale will fund its overseas operations and meet other general business needs. The bonds, which were 8.5 times oversubscribed in the primary market, will list and trade on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd from mid-July, the company said. Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX>, Standard Chartered Bank <STAN.L>, Wing Lung Bank and ICBC Asia <601398.SS> <1398.HK> jointly coordinated the issue. Before the sale, Fitch Ratings had assigned China Huarong's proposed offshore U.S. dollar senior unsecured notes an expected "A (EXP)" rating. Fitch also gave Huarong an "A" rating with a stable outlook for its long-term local- and foreign-currency debt. [ID:nFit707341]
