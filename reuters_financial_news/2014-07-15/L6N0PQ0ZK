DUBAI, July 15 (Reuters) - The short-term technical outlook for the Abu Dhabi stock market has improved, suggesting the possibility of further gains on Tuesday, although the Ramadan lull may prevent any extended uptrend.

Abu Dhabi's index <.ADI> gained 1.5 percent to 4,914 points on Monday as trading volume more than doubled. This triggered an inverse head & shoulders pattern formed by the late June and early July highs, and pointing back up to the May peak of 5,255 points. Dubai <.DFMGI>, on the other hand, has not cleanly broken chart resistance in the 4,600-point area and its trading volume has been recovering more slowly. Shares in Dubai Investment bank Shuaa Capital <SHUA.DU> may attract interest after it said its second-quarter net profit more than quadrupled, but the recovery trend in its earnings was already well-known. [ID:nL6N0PQ0YL] Elsewhere, Saudi Cement <3030.SE>, the kingdom's largest listed cement producer by market value, could rise after it slightly beat analysts' expectations for second-quarter profit late on Monday. The firm made a net profit of 288 million riyals ($76.8 million) while six analysts polled by Reuters had forecast, on average, a profit of 272.7 million riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0PP3P2]
