MUMBAI, July 15 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, snapping a five-day selling streak as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> surged after inflation slowed amid a deficient monsoon, and ahead of the central bank's policy review next month.

ICICI Bank provisionally rose 3.4 percent while State Bank of India <SBI.NS> ended up 4.3 percent.
