MADRID, July 15 (Reuters) - Spanish police raided the headquarters of wireless networks provider Gowex <GOW.MC> on Tuesday in search of documents related to an accounting fraud in which the High Court has charged nine additional people.

The Gowex search was ordered by investigative magistrate Santiago Pedraz, who on Monday gave former Chairman and Chief Executive Jenaro Garcia Martin 15 days to pay bail of 600,000 euros ($818,400) or face jail. [ID:nL6N0PP34W] Garcia Martin, who has confessed to misrepresenting the company's accounts for at least the last four years, is charged with false accounting, distortion of economic and financial information and insider trading. He could face more than 10 years in jail. Pedraz widened the investigation on Tuesday by charging and calling to testify Garcia Martin's wife Florencia Mate, former head of investor relations, as well as the firm's chief financial officer Francisco Martinez Marugan, board member Javier Solsona and auditor Jose Antonio Diaz Villanueva. He also charged and called to testify four executives at other Spanish telecoms companies and a former Gowex board member, Ricardo Moreno Warleta, who signed the firm's accounts  between 2010 and 2013. The High Court did not specify the charges. Separately, Pedraz has asked Luxembourg authorities to provide any information about assets owned by Garcia Martin and Mate in a local bank account. During his testimony before the High Court on Monday, Garcia Martin acknowledged he had at least 3 million euros in a Luxembourg-based bank account.
