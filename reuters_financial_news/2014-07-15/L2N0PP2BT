WASHINGTON, July 15 (Reuters) - Shutting down the U.S. Export-Import Bank could take months and winding down its business may take years should Congress decide not to renew the bank's charter by Sept. 30 and force it to stop issuing new credit.

For 80 years Ex-Im has offered financing to foreign buyers of U.S. goods. In 2013 its loans were behind $37.4 billion of exports and 205,000 U.S. jobs, benefiting the likes of aerospace giant Boeing <BA.N> and heavy equipment manufacturers such as General Electric <GE.N> and Caterpillar <CAT.N>. Conservative Republicans are calling for the bank's charter to lapse. A decision by Congress not to reauthorize the bank would set in motion a series of events:  "ORDERLY LIQUIDATION" U.S. law authorizes Ex-Im to perform certain functions after its termination, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has told Congress. It may continue as a corporate agency of the United States and exercise any of its functions "for purposes of an orderly liquidation," including administering its assets and collecting any obligations it holds. The law does not address how long the bank might do this. Nor does it define "orderly liquidation." The phrase suggests the bank could undertake any activity it thinks is necessary to settle its affairs in a methodical way, CRS lawyers said.   CONSIDERABLE DISCRETION The bank would appear to have "considerable discretion" in structuring its orderly liquidation if Congress doesn't specifically tell it how to do so, CRS told lawmakers. Ex-Im Bank says that, if its authority lapses, it will manage its portfolio until maturity, including collecting funds, processing claims and making payments where it is obligated to do so but has been no more specific about what that means. SERVICING EXISTING LOANS The bank, probably with Treasury Department and White House Office of Management and Budget input, and discussions with Congress, would need a plan for collecting payments on outstanding loans. The bank has roughly $113 billion in exposure, about $12 billion of which rolls off the bank's books each year as loans mature. At that rate it might take 10 years for the bank's loans to be paid off. SKELETON STAFF Analysts estimate that 100 or fewer of the bank's roughly 400 staff would be needed to service loans and administer the bank's commitments, and the number would dwindle as loans matured.  The administration might decide to make Ex-Im eventually transfer some or all of those functions to the Treasury in a process that could take up to a year.  The bank might not have to leave its headquarters on Vermont Avenue in downtown Washington right away but would likely soon close its 12 offices around the United States.   ANOTHER PUSH TO SAVE EX-IM? Some congressional aides say lawmakers who support the bank could make another push to extend the bank's charter after the November election. The lengthy process of winding down the bank's affairs could give backers another opportunity to restore its charter.  Lawmakers who back the bank might seek to keep it in operation by including either a charter renewal provision or a funding provision in a stopgap government funding bill Congress is expected to take up at the end of September.   CHANGING EXPORT AND CREDIT PATTERNS Withdrawal of Ex-Im support would hit those small- and medium-sized businesses outside big supply chains the hardest; they would face greater difficulty finding commercial loans, analysts say. Opponents of the bank say that since Ex-Im's backing benefits only 2 percent of all U.S. exports, the effects would be narrowly felt, and that private financing could fill much of the gap.
