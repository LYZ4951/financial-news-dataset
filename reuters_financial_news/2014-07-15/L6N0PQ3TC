DUBAI, July 15 (Reuters) - Kuwait's Gulf Bank <GBKK.KW>, the Gulf state's fourth-largest lender by assets, reported a 9 percent increase in second-quarter net profit on Tuesday.

Net profit for the three months to the end of June was 6.87 million dinars ($24.4 million), compared to 6.3 million dinars in the year-earlier period, according to Reuters calculations. Gulf Bank didn't provide a quarterly breakdown so Reuters calculated the figure based on the bank's first-half financial statement. The figure missed the estimate of analysts at Arqaam Capital, who had forecast an 8 million dinar profit for the quarter.
