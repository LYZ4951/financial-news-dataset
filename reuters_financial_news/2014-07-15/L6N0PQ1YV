LISBON, July 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Espirito Santo, Portugal's largest listed bank, plunged 20 percent on Tuesday to a record low on persistent worries over the bank's exposure to the troubled companies of its founding family, traders said.

At 0850 GMT shares in BES were 17.5 percent down at 0.367 euros a share after hitting an all-time low of 0.3550. The Lisbon PSI20 <.PSI20> stock index was 1.6 percent down. Jose Novo, a trader at Orey iTrade brokers, said the stock was being hit by concerns over the bank's Angolan loan portfolio and the fact that the founding family sold shares in the bank on Monday at a low price. The family sold a 5 percent stake in the bank on Monday at 0.34 euros a share. "The sale by ESFG at a brutal discount shows they are jumping ship," said Novo.
