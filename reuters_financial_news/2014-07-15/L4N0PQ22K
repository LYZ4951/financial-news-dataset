HONG KONG, July 15 (Reuters) - China shares ended up on Tuesday as gains food and beverage companies erased losses stemming from concerns a second batch of initial public offerings (IPOs) could pull funds from existing stocks.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> added 0.2 percent at 2,070.36 points, hovering at a four-week high. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also inched up 0.2 percent. Chinese liquor makers rose again on a brightening outlook for the beaten-down sector. Kweichow Moutai <600519.SS> rose 2.7 percent and Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery <002304.SZ> jumped 5.4 percent. Among top index drags, Chongqing Changan Automobile <000625.SZ>, at a record high on Friday, sank 4.6 percent.
