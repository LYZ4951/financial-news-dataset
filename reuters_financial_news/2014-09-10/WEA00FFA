STOCKHOLM, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Sweden's countercyclical buffer will be set at one percent, as previously indicated, the country's financial regulator said on Wednesday.

The four major Swedish banks will have to hold between 14.7 to 19 percent of common equity tier 1 capital, Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said in a statement.
