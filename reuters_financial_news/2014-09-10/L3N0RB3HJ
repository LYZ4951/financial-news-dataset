BANGKOK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Indonesia's key stock market index posted its worst drop in two months on Wednesday amid outflows and losses in large-caps as the prospect of a sooner-than-expected U.S. rate hike triggered selling across markets in Southeast Asia.

Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> closed down 1.04 percent the biggest one-day fall since July 11. Shares of Astra International <ASII.JK>, the most actively traded stock, slipped 2.3 percent due to selling by foreign investors, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Indonesian stock market saw net selling by foreign investors of 816 billion rupiah ($69.11 million), Thomson Reuters data showed.  Other markets also posted net foreign outflows as Asian shares tumbled on Wednesday, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> down 1.3 percent. Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates lower for longer, and to raise them more slowly than the makers of U.S monetary policy themselves expect, according to research published Monday by the San Francisco Fed. [ID:nL1N0R915N] Malaysia <.KLSE> posted net foreign outflow worth 94.62 million ringgit ($29.57 million) and Thailand <.SETI> reported a net outflow of 224 million baht ($6.96 million).
