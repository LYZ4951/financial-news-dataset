STOCKHOLM, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Swedish construction firm Skanska has been picked as the preferred bidder for the 600 million pound ($966 million) redevelopment of the Battersea Power Station, according to a story posted on British construction industry magazine Building's website on Wednesday.

Building said Balfour Beatty <BALF.L>, Lend Lease, Mace and Skanska had been battling all summer for the contract, with all four pitching for the job with the Malaysian owners last month. "It is understood that following the Malaysian pitch, the race for the job narrowed to Skanska and Balfour Beatty, with Skanska this week getting the job," Building said. Skanska declined to comment on the report. "We only comment on signed contracts," Edvard Lind, head of media relations at Skanska told Reuters.
