Sept 10 (Reuters) - Tianhe Chemicals <1619.HK> denied allegations on Wednesday from a research house that it had overstated profits in its initial public offering prospectus.

The report from Anonymous Analytics, which describes itself as a "faction" of the hacker group Anonymous, spurred a trading halt, a spike in the cost of borrowing Tianhe shares and led to Goldman Sachs and UBS suspending their ratings on the stock. [ID:nL3N0RA2J5] Tianhe said it "unequivocally denies and vigorously refutes the groundless allegations in the report" [ID:nL3N0R31OE] Tianhe released a statement after it said its email system had been hacked. The company did not say when its stock would resume trading but said it wanted to get in front of any leakage of ongoing communication between itself and Hong Kong's stock exchange. Tianhe said it had obtained tax confirmations from local authorities which confirm the amounts presented in the share listing prospectus. Anonymous Analytics has in the past targeted other Chinese firms include Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings <0682.HK> and online firm Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd <QIHU.N>. The Anonymous Analytics report is the first short-selling report targeting a leading Hong Kong-listed Chinese company in recent years and is significant given Tianhe's size and investor base that included Fidelity and Robeco as of July-end. Morgan Stanley's private equity arm still holds an estimated $300 million stake in Tianhe.
