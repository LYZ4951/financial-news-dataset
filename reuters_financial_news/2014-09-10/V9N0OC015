VIENNA, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) <RBIV.VI> said on Wednesday it would appeal against a verdict issued by a Hungarian court in a loan refunds case that could cost the banking sector in the country up to 3 billion euros ($3.87 billion).

A Hungarian court rejected on Wednesday a lawsuit brought by the local unit of Austria's Raiffeisen to challenge a new law which the government says would compensate clients for past unfair lending practices.

We will appeal against this decision," RBI said in an emailed statement.
