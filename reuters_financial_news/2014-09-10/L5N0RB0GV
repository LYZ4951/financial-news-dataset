LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - London Stock Exchange Group <LSE.L> said on Wednesday it sees an encouraging pipeline of companies seeking to raise capital on its markets.

In a trading update the bourse said that revenues from trading of stocks and bonds were higher year-on-year in August and that its FTSE index business and LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house in which it has a majority stake, performed well last month. The statement covers a shorter period than usual because the exchange group gave a financial update last month when it unveiled the details of a $1.6 billion rights issue that is helping to fund a takeover of U.S. index compiler Frank Russell.[ID:nL5N0QS0LW][ID:nL6N0P71JP] LSE shareholders are meeting later on Wednesday in connection with the deal, worth $2.7 billion in total, that will help the bourse build a much larger footprint in the U.S.
