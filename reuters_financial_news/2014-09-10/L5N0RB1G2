STOCKHOLM, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Shares in Swedish mobile payment company Seamless <SEAM.ST> dropped 7 percent on Wednesday, a day after U.S. tech giant Apple <AAPL.O> launched a similar service it called "Apple Pay".

Seamless' shares were down 6.2 percent at 0925 GMT at 27.4 Swedish crowns, compared to a 0.2 percent fall for the broader market in Stockholm <.OMXSPI>, as investors feared Apple's service could threaten Seamless' SEQR mobile payment service. But Remium analyst Nils Sjogren said that threat could be over blown because Apple Pay's business model is different to that of Seamless' SEQR service, which is based on targeting retailers with promises of lower transaction fees.  "The Seamless business model is to halve card fees for retailers. What Apple has done is to incorporate credit cards in its mobile, much like Google Wallet, which has been around for a while. It won't affect card fees at all", Sjogren said.  "The only threat is that Apple succeeds in attracting customers in a better way than SEQR has done so far, creating a habit with this application," he said. However, growth in mobile payments trends, would be a positive for Seamless, he said. Seamless has said SEQR is cheaper for retailers partly because transactions includes fewer stakeholders than a regular a card payment.  The Swedish company hopes for strong growth in the segment, but revenues amounted to just 1.8 million Swedish crowns in the second quarter, down from 2.1 in the corresponding period last year.
