BUDAPEST, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Hungary's government on Friday will submit a proposed law specifying details of how banks will make mandatory reimbursements to loan clients for past charges the authorities considered unfair.

Antal Rogan, Parliament leader of the ruling Fidesz party, also told the daily Magyar Nemzet in an interview on Wednesday that they may impose an interest rate hike moratorium on banks until a new system of "fair banks and lending" is worked out. Rogan said he expects the legislation to be passed on Sept. 24.
