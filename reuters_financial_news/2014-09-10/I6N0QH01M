MARANELLO, Italy, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Outgoing Ferrari Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo said on Wednesday that taking on the chairmanship of Alitalia was a possibility but he would decide only after leaving the sports car maker in October.

The CEO of UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, one of the main shareholders of Alitalia, said on Wednesday Montezemolo would be a good candidate for the chairmanship of the Italian carrier. [ID:nI6N0QH01N]
