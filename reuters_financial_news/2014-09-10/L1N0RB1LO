NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - 21Vianet Group Inc's <VNET.O> shares fell as much as 35 percent before recovering and attracted big bearish bets in the options market on Wednesday after a short-selling research firm issued a research report on the China-based data center service provider, accusing the company of questionable business practices.

Shares were up $1.24, or 6 percent, $23.15, in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. The stock hit a low of $14.23 on the session before rebounding. About 28 million shares changed hands, making it the third most-active on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the day.  The stock plunged earlier on Wednesday after a research firm called Trinity Research Group, in a 121-page report on its website, accused the company of overstating revenue and accounting irregularities. 21Vianet responded in a publicly issued statement, noting that a "short seller" made the allegations and that they contain numerous errors, unsupported speculation and malicious interpretations of events. The company said it "intends to take all appropriate legal actions to defend itself against these malicious allegations." Shares recovered after the statement was issued.  Trinity's website does not name any of its principals or partners or provide a telephone number. "We do not disclose our exact locations but we have presence in China and the US," the company said in an emailed response to a Reuters request for comment. Options volume on 21Vianet spiked to 13 times normal with 62,000 puts and 14,000 calls traded on Wednesday, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. The September $22.5 strike puts, which expire at the close on September 20, were the most active, according to Trade Alert. The cost of those options rose sharply - at one point hitting $8.40 each - as the stock tumbled, only to turn around later and sell off as those bearish bets started to lose value when shares recovered. Lately those puts were trading at just $2.15 each.
