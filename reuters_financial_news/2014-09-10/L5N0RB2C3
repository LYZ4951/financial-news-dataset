LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Standard Lfe <SL.L> on Wednesday reiterated it could transfer business to England if necessary after next week's Scottish independence vote, and said it would have no impact on dividend payments or its London listing.

The plans, first announced in February, could mean the transfer of pensions, investments, and other savings held by UK customers to new companies in England.

This would enable transactions with all UK customers outside Scotland to be in sterling, to be part of the UK tax regime and to be covered by UK consumer protection and regulatory requirements, Standard Life said.
