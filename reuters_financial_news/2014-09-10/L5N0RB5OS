Sept 10 (Reuters) - Britain's Lloyds Banking Group Plc <LLOY.L>, which is based in Scotland, said on Wednesday it would set up legal entities in England as part of its contingency planning for next week's referendum on Scottish independence.

Separately, government and banking sources said Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>, another major British bank located in Scotland, would base itself in London in the event of independence being approved.
