MUMBAI, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Wednesday, retreating from record highs hit early this week, as worries that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates sooner than expected hit blue-chips such as Infosys.

Falls tracked lower global shares after a paper from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank released on Monday argued that investors could be underestimating the speed at which the U.S. central bank might raise interest rates. [ID:nL1N0R915N] Foreign investors have been a key driver of this year's record-setting rally in Indian shares, and as of Tuesday had been net buyers for a seventh consecutive session, bringing their total for the year to $13.94 billion. Caution is also expected to prevail ahead of the consumer inflation data due on Friday, the last one before the Reserve Bank of India's policy review on Sept. 30. [ID:nL3N0R64RF] "Today's fall is more of a technical correction, which will give a better entry for fresh participants. A larger amount of capital investment is awaited. We are relatively more positive towards the market," said Deven Choksey, managing director, KR Choksey Securities.
