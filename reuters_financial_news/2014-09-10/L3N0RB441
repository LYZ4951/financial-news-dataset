MUMBAI, Sept 10 (Reuters) - India's IDFC Ltd <IDFC.NS> is set to launch a share sale to institutional investors on Wednesday to raise up to $140 million, two sources directly involved in the deal said.

The share sale is expected to be priced at an up to 6 percent discount to the stock's Wednesday closing price of 144.90 rupees, said the sources, who declined to be named as the deal is not yet public. IDFC declined comment. IDFC, an infrastructure lender, is one of the two companies that won licences this year to set up banks.
