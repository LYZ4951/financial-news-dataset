-- New ECB measures are neither QE, nor ouvertures to it - Mersch

FRANKFURT, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's plans to buy asset-backed securities (ABS) and covered bonds are not comparable with a broad asset-purchase programme nor do they signal that such a step could follow, ECB policymaker Yves Mersch said on Wednesday.

The ECB cut interest rates to fresh record lows and announced the ABS and covered bonds purchase plans last Thursday, triggering market speculation that they may precede quantitative easing (QE) - essentially printing money to buy assets.  Mersch dismissed such speculation, noting in the text of a speech for delivery in Frankfurt that QE in the euro zone would inevitably throw up institutional and legal questions. "They are neither comparable with a broad programme of quantitative easing, nor do they represent the ouvertures to that," he said of the ABS and covered bond plans, adding: "Neither is the economic logic of Anglo-Saxon QE programmes transferable one-to-one to a bank-financed economic system like the euro zone. Nor would the effectiveness be secured at the moment given the strongly retreated yields of marketable paper." Rather, he said a broad plan to buy government bonds in the euro zone would only ever go ahead under two conditions: inflation would have to remain at its current low levels for too long, and the ECB would have to adhere strictly to its monetary policy mandate. Euro zone inflation slowed to 0.3 percent in August, far below the ECB's target of just under 2 percent over the medium term. Mersch, who sits on the six-member Executive Board that forms the nucleus of the ECB's policymaking Governing Council, said ECB monetary policy could not be at its optimal without governments pursuing reforms to shape up their economies.
