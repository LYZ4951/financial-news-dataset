Sept 10 (Reuters) - Bank credit growth in Qatar slowed to 7.1 percent in July, its lowest level since at least 2006, from 11.3 percent in the previous month, central bank data showed.

But money supply (M2) growth accelerated to 8.8 percent year-on-year at the end of July from 4.8 percent in the previous month. Non-resident deposits fell 16.2 percent on an annual basis and 3.2 percent month-on-month to 32.1 billion riyals ($8.8 billion).
