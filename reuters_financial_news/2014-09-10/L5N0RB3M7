BUDAPEST, Sept 10 (Reuters) - A Hungarian court rejected on Wednesday a lawsuit brought by the local unit of Austrian Raiffeisen Bank <RBIV.VI> to challenge a new law mandating refunds to clients on loans, Judge Szilvia Nagy said.

"(The court) primarily examined the principle of transparency and the system of contract conditions used by the bank did not comply with this (principle) in any of the periods examined," the judge said. The first-degree ruling is open to appeal.
