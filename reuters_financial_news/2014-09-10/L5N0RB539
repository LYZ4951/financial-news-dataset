BUDAPEST, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's recent interest rate cut and stimulus measures support Hungary's central bank in keeping local interest rates low for a sustained period, rate-setter Csaba Kandracs told national news agency MTI on Wednesday.

However, he added that the ECB's steps were not sufficient in themselves to trigger a policy change by the National Bank of Hungary, which has pledged to keep its base rate at a record low 2.1 percent <NBHI> until the end of next year.
