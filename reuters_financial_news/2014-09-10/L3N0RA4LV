SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Australian shares lost 0.7 percent on Wednesday as most sectors sold off after Wall Street lost ground overnight on fears of earlier than expected Fed rate hikes, and a measure of Australian consumer confidence slumped.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index suffered a sharp reversal showing a drop of 4.6 percent in September, from August when it jumped 3.8 percent, as households became more concerned about the outlook for the economy and employment. [ID:nS9N0M301V] Among consumer discretionary stocks, department store operator Myer Holdings Ltd <MYR.AX> declined 0.6 percent, electronics and entertainment retailer JB Hi-Fi Ltd <JBH.AX> slipped 0.1 percent, and Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd <HVN.AX> dropped 1.1 percent.  The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> tumbled 39.8 points to 5,568.1 by 0302 GMT, hovering around 3-1/2 week lows. The benchmark rose 0.5 percent on Tuesday. A group of stocks trading ex-dividend also dragged the market lower with Woolworths Ltd <WOW.AX>,Australia's largest supermarket chain by market share, tumbling 2.3 percent which to shave 4 points off the ASX 200 index, while health insurance company NIB Holdings Ltd <NHF.AX> slumped 5.2 percent.  The Australian benchmark jumped to a six-year peak of 5,679.5 on Aug. 21, since then, global growth worries, geopolitical tensions and a sharp drop in iron ore prices have dragged on the market. Iron ore miners continued to pressure the market as Shanghai rebar futures fell more than 2 percent to a record low. Bluechips BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> lost 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd <FMG.AX> skid 1.6 percent after the company said the Western Australian government plans to introduce legislation to "validate a number of past environmental approvals". [ID:nWNBS00OX5] "The continued weakness in iron ore has seen continued selling in that space which is a pretty big proportion of our market," said Ben Clark, a portfolio manager at TMS Capital. "It's a market that looks fairly valued so it's easy to see a correction."  Macmahon Holdings Ltd <MAH.AX> bounced 4.6 percent to A$0.115 after securing a new three year funding facility, saying its book-build closed oversubscribed, and the facility will be upsized from A$280 million to A$317.5 million. [ID:nWNBS00OWC] New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index <.NZ50> slipped 10.23 points to 5,233.47, creeping further away from a record high hit at the start of the week as the index tracked losses in global share markets. The slight losses reflected the ownership cut-off dates for dividend payments for companies including Air New Zealand <AIR.NZ>, steel products manufacturer Steel and Tube <STU.NZ> and online auction site TradeMe <TME.NZ>. But market participants said that overall movements were subdued as many investors were sidelined ahead of general elections on Sept. 22. A win is expected for the ruling, business-friendly National party, which would be positive for shares, although the make-up of a likely coalition government remains up in the air.  Power companies including Mighty River Power <MRP.NZ> and Meridian Energy <MELCA.NZ> held most of their gains after rallying in the lead-up to the vote, as falling support for the opposition Labour party is seen scuttling a proposal to create a national wholesale electricity buyer. This has reduced the risk of lower revenues in the sector, which market participants said would support those shares in the near term. "We could see a bit of an uptick in those companies as (Labour's) Kiwi power proposal would definitely be off the table," said James Smalley, director at Hamilton Hindin Greene, referring to a National win in the polls.
