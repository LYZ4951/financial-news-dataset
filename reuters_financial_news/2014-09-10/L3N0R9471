WELLINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged, as expected, on Thursday, and said a slowdown in growth, soft inflation pressures, and falling commodity prices meant it would likely stay on the sidelines for the foreseeable future.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held its official cash rate at 3.50 percent, after four rises totalling 100 basis points between March and July. It said further rate rises would be needed, but it was prudent to stay on hold for a period as it assessed the impact of the rises to date, and monitored the strength of the economy, the housing market, strong immigration, and a still elevated exchange rate. All 14 economists polled by Reuters had expected no change to rates, but opinion has now shifted to a resumption to rate rises in the first quarter of next year, most likely March, from earlier consensus of December.

They're on pause, on hold, but they are expecting to put rates up further in the future. "They've reduced their cash rate or short rate track by about 50 basis points, half a percent, that's consistent with lower growth and lower inflation. "It's probably on the soft side and the response of the markets to cut the currency seems appropriate. "It looks like it's likely to be early next year (for the next move)."   MICHAEL TURNER, STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS "Looking at their bill track, its about 50 basis points lower in the long run. So it's a pause, and the RBNZ thinks it'll have to tighten less than first assumed. That should not  disturb markets too much. "There's nothing in this to shake our view of a pause for a few months and then a resumption of tightening in the first quarter of next year."
