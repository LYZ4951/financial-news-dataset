Sept 10 (Reuters) - Famed U.S. short seller Carson Block, head of research firm Muddy Waters LLC, is shorting Chinese online lottery platform 500.com <WBAI.N>, Block said on Wednesday.

Block, who has exposed accounting problems at a slew of Chinese companies, said the lottery company had some "red flags," including an uncertain regulatory environment. He spoke on the sidelines at a public event at Baruch College on Wednesday. "We're short it," Block said. "As we termed it, it's in a legally somewhat gray area because the licensing regime is not clear, is not finalized."
