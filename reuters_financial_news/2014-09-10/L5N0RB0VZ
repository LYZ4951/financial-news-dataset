LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - European shares fell for a fourth straight day on Wednesday, tracking falls in U.S. and Asian shares overnight, as the prospect of a tightening in U.S. monetary conditions unnerved investors at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty.

Apple supplier ARM Holding <ARM.L> fell 2.3 percent to feature among top European fallers, tracking a late fall in the U.S. firm's shares after the unveiling of a watch, two larger iPhones and a mobile payments service on Tuesday. [ID:nL1N0RA1Q6] At 0810 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.2 percent at 1,382.72 points, falling for a fourth day after hitting a 6-1/2 year high on Thursday. Asian and U.S. shares fell overnight as markets wagered the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates earlier than expected.
