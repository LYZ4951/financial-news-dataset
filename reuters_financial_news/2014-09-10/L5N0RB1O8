PRAGUE, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The ceasefire in Ukraine should be given some time to produce a political dialogue before more sanctions are imposed on Russia, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman Didier Burkhalter said on Wednesday.

"The question has to be... is it a timely situation now for announcing new sanctions or does it make the fragile situation more fragile," Burkhalter, the president of Switzerland which holds the OSCE presidency, told reporters when asked about the timing of further European Union sanctions on Russia.
