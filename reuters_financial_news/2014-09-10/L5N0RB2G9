LAGOS, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Nigeria plans to sell 100 billion naira ($615 million) worth of bonds with maturities ranging from 3 to 20 years at an auction next Wednesday, the Debt Management Office said on Wednesday.

The debt office said it will auction 15 billion naira in the 3-year bond, 50 billion in the 10-year paper and 35 billion naira in the 20-year debt note, using a Dutch auction system. The bonds are reopenings of previously issued debt notes, the debt office said, noting that the results of the auction will be released the following day.
