MILAN, May 21 (Reuters) - Shareholders in Italian lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> approved on Wednesday a proposal to boost the size of a planned share sale to 5 billion euros ($6.9 billion) to help it absorb a hit on its finances it expects from a Europe-wide bank health check.

At an extraordinary meeting in the bank's hometown of Siena, shareholders agreed to boost the capital increase, initially planned at 3 billion euros, by two billion euros as requested by the bank's management.
