BANGKOK, May 21 (Reuters) - Bank of Ayudhya Pcl <BAY.BK>, Thailand's fifth largest lender, said on Wednesday its 2014 loans would rise only 4.5-5.0 percent, well below the company's target, if the prolonged political unrest drags down the country's economy to grow just 1.5 percent this year.

The bank, 72 percent owned by Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T>, however maintained its 2014 loan growth target of 7-9 percent, President Philip Tan told reporters.The bank aims to keep its non-performing loan (NPL) at 2.5 percent of total lending at the end of this year and plans to set aside more loan-loss provision in the second quarter if the number of bad debt rises, Tan said.
