LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air is set to unveil plans for a London initial public offering on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said, reviving stock market listing plans for Central and Eastern Europe's largest budget airline.

Barclays <BARC.L>, Citigroup <C.N> and JP Morgan <JPM.N> would lead the listing of Wizz, the source said on Wednesday. The three banks were appointed last year but the listing never occurred. [ID:nL5N0FB1ND]
