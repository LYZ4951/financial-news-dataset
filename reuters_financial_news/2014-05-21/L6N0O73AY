May 21 (Reuters) - Malaysia's Hong Leong Islamic Bank Bhd, a wholly-owned unit of Hong Leong Bank <HLBB.KL>, has set up an Islamic bond programme to raise as much as 1 billion ringgit ($310 million).

The subordinated sukuk programme is Basel-III compliant and will be treated as Tier 2 regulatory capital, rating agency RAM Ratings said in a statement on Wednesday.
