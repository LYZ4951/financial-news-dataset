DUBAI, May 21 (Reuters) - Pakistan's central bank has given Meezan Bank Ltd <AMZN.KA> approval "in-principle" to purchase the local banking business of HSBC <HSBA.L>, the sharia-compliant lender said in a bourse filing on Wednesday.

The statement did not give a price for the deal, which still requires shareholder approval and final consent by the regulator. The sale is part of a strategy by Europe's biggest bank to exit from countries where it is unprofitable or lacks scale. HSBC's Pakistan unit has 10 branches and had assets of about $455 million at the end of 2013. In contrast, Pakistani lenders are expanding, buoyed by regulatory steps to develop the Islamic banking sector in the world's second-most populous Muslim nation. HSBC and Meezan Bank agreed the deal earlier this month, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. [ID:nASM0006NK]
