MUMBAI, May 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell on Wednesday, snapping a four-session winning streak as blue-chips including Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS> fell, a day after foreign investors turned net sellers for the first time in about a month.

Investors took the opportunity to book profits in recent outperformers, especially in domestic-oriented sectors that led a powerful rally in anticipation of a victory by the Bharatiya Janata Party and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. Larsen & Toubro provisionally fell 2.1 percent while State Bank of India <SBI.NS> ended over 2 percent lower.
