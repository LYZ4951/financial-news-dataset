MILAN, May 21 (Reuters) - Italian banks should post collective net profit of 2.8 billion euros ($3.83 billion) in 2014, bouncing back from total net losses for the sector worth just below 16 billion euros last year, economic think-thank Prometeia forecast on Wednesday.

According to Prometeia, Italian banks should collectively turn in net profit worth 23 billion euros over 2014-2016,  leaving behind the deep losses suffered between 2011 and 2013, but still just a third of the net profit posted over 2005-07.
