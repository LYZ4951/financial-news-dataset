MADRID, May 21 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Liberbank <LBK.MC> said on Wednesday it was launching an accelerated share placement ahead of a rights issue, in two transactions through which it aims to raise up to 575 million euros ($786 million).

The bank, which had already announced it planned a rights issue to repay state aid, said it would place about 375 million shares through the prior share offering, including some stock owned by its controlling shareholders, a group of savings banks.
