May 21 (Reuters) - New York banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky said on Wednesday he is looking into reports Ocwen Financial Corp <OCN.N> is requiring struggling homeowners to agree not to criticize the company in public if they want to have a mortgage modified.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that a number of companies collecting payments on home loans, including Ocwen, are increasingly demanding borrowers in litigation sign non-disparagement clauses if they want the terms on their mortgages eased. In some cases, servicers are also demanding the clauses be inserted in loans modified outside of litigation. [ID:nL1N0O62AJ]  Those clauses prohibit consumers from printing or posting anything negative about the companies. "Reports that Ocwen is imposing a gag rule for certain struggling homeowners - preventing them from criticizing the company - are troubling and deeply offensive," Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services, said in an emailed statement to Reuters. "We will investigate this issue immediately." "Servicers have a responsibility to act in the best interest of borrowers and investors - not to try and sweep shoddy practices under the rug or muzzle struggling homeowners," Lawsky added.  A source familiar with Lawsky's thinking said the probe could be expanded to other servicers.
