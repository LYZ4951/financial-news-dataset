COLOMBO, May 21 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's stock exchange is struggling with lack of liquidity, and it is trying to increase the free float of the shares it lists to attract foreign funds, the chief executive of the exchange said on Wednesday.

"Liquidity is the main challenge," Rajeeva Bandaranaike told Reuters. "If we can break that and get the levels of liquidity in the market, we can encourage more funds to come in."  Foreign funds have long complained of lack of liquidity on the Colombo Exchange, which limits their entry and exit from the 2.63 trillion-rupee ($20.2 billion) bourse. In December, the country's Securities and Exchange said it was in talks with government funds about making large share parcels available to foreign investors. That move came days after the SEC ordered the main listed firms to have a minimum 20 percent free share floating.

The other thing is to get new listings. We are talking to big corporates to encourage them to get listed."  New companies, he said, "are quite positive on listing. Some have committed to get listed. I think it is a matter of time." Although 60 firms have been listed since a 26-year civil war ended in 2009, market liquidity never surged. A foreign inflow of 1.34 billion this year is largely due to 30 percent, or $6.28 billion rupees, divestment by Expolanka Holdings Plc <EXPO.CM> to S.G Holdings, a Japan-based holding company of freight and logistic company Sagawa group. [ID:nL3N0NV5ED]  The market is recovering from a crash in the main share index <.CSE> from a record high of 7,863.74 on Feb. 15, 2011. Optimism over post-war growth produced gains of 125 percent in 2009 and 96 percent in 2010.  "There was an unusual rise," Bandaranaike said. "Now there is no impetus or reason for the market to go in that direction." The index fell 22.8 percent after hitting its record high in 2011 and 7.1 percent in 2012, but rebounded with a 4.8 percent 2013 gain. It is up 6.4 percent so far this year. "We see increased levels of activity. Foreign investors are bullish about Sri Lanka ... We feel the index will sustain the gaining momentum," the exchange CEO said.
