LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulator on Wednesday won an appeal against a court decision to throw out a landmark fraud case because some of the defendants had been unable to find lawyers willing to represent them in court.

The Court of Appeal said the previous ruling involved  errors of law or principle and was not reasonable. The Financial Conduct Authority welcomed the decision, said it was committed to pursue criminal action in appropriate cases and was pleased the case could now proceed to trial.
