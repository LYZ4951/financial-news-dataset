SIENA, May 21 (Reuters) - Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena's <BMPS.MI> CEO Fabrizio Viola said on Wednesday the Italian lender would launch a planned rights issue in early June with the aim to complete it in early July.

The board of the Tuscan lender last month approved increasing the size of a planned capital increase to 5 billion euros ($6.85 billion) from 3 billion euros to absorb any potential loss uncovered by a European health check of lenders. [nI6N0MW01U]
