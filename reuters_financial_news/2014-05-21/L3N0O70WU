HONG KONG, May 21 (Reuters) - CVC Capital Partners Ltd [CVC.UL] has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Hong Kong-based serviced office provider The Executive Centre Ltd from Headland Capital Partners.

London-based CVC did not disclose the deal's value. Executive Centre generates more than $100 million in revenues from operations in 10 Asian countries. The investment will be CVC's first from its new $3.5 billion Asia fund, which closed this week. [ID:nL3N0O51P0] Headland Capital, a former Asia private equity unit of HSBC that was spun out of the bank in 2010, specialises in deals where it buys majority stakes. HSBC Holdings Plc <HSBA.L> and Babson Capital provided financing to back CVC's acquisition of the stake in Executive Centre.
