TEL AVIV, May 22 (Reuters) - China's Bright Food (Group) Co Ltd [SHMNGA.UL] has signed a deal to buy 56 percent of Tnuva from private equity firm Apax and Partners [APAX.UL] in a deal valuing Israel's largest food company at 8.6 billion shekels ($2.5 billion), Israeli news websites reported late on Wednesday.

Bright Food has not yet reached an agreement with Israeli investment company Mivtach Shamir Holdings Ltd <MISH.TA>, which owns 21 percent of Tnuva, the Calcalist website said. A group of kibbutzim, or cooperative farms, own the rest of Tnuva, a dairy specialist. Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Bright Food confirmed last September that it was in talks to acquire control of Tnuva. [ID:nL4N0GZ2KE]
