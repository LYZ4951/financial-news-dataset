COLOMBO, May 21 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka stocks ended weaker on Wednesday from a more than 11 month high hit in the previous session, as investors booked profits in blue-chips, but stockbrokers said the outlook was still positive due to multi-year low interest rates.

The main stock index <.CSE> ended 0.51 percent, or 32.29 points, weaker at 6,289.32, slipping from its highest close since June 10 last year.  "Profit-taking in blue-chips dragged the market down," a stockbroker said asking not to be named.  Stockbrokers expect gains due to lower interest rates after the central bank kept key rates at multi-year lows on Tuesday for the fourth straight month, as expected. [ID:nL3N0O60TJ] The exchange witnessed net foreign inflow of 496 million rupees ($3.80 million) worth of shares on Wednesday, extending year-to-date net foreign inflow to 1.34 billion rupees.  The day's turnover stood at 944.2 million rupees, less than this year's daily average of 1.03 billion. Shares of leading fixed-line telephone operator Sri Lanka Telecom PLC <SLTL.CM> fell 2.69 percent to 47 rupees a share, while top conglomerate John Keells Holdings PLC <JKH.CM> fell 0.17 percent to 233.60 rupees. The market has been on a rising trend since mid-March as many investors were compelled to return to the stock market because low interest rates have made fixed-income assets less attractive, stockbrokers said. However, analysts have raised concerns over sluggish economic growth due to lower credit growth and consumer spending. Despite a multi-year low interest rate regime, data showed private sector credit grew 4.3 percent in March from a year earlier, the slowest expansion since May 2010, while imports in February fell 6.2 percent on the year.
