STOCKHOLM, May 21 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at 6.00 percent on Wednesday and said increasing domestic consumption would probably mean rate hikes ahead.

"The level of the Bank's neutral real rate is uncertain, but increased growth in domestic demand in the near term will probably require further increases in the Bank's real interest rate, other things being equal," the bank said in a statement.
