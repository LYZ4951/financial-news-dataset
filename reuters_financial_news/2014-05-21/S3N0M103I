STOCKHOLM, May 21 (Reuters) - Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Wednesday moves to boost bank capital requirements and deal with high levels of household debt in the Nordic country will be a process that plays out over several years.

"I think we need, on a continuous basis, to tighten the demands on the bank system and take further measures to reduce risks with household debt and that is a process that is going to go on for several years ahead," Borg told reporters on the sidelines of a banking conference.
