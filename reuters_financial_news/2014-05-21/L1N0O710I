NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - Canadian equipment finance company Element Financial Corp <EFN.TO> is in exclusive talks to buy PHH Corp's <PHH.N> fleet leasing business for about $1.35 billion in cash, in a deal structured to include significant tax benefits, according to a source familiar with the matter on Wednesday.

PHH said in February that it was considering separating or selling its mortgage and auto fleet leasing businesses.  The source said a deal with Element for the fleet leasing business, PHH Arval, could come within the next two weeks. But the source added that the two sides had not finalized the deal yet and some details, including customer issues, needed to be worked out.  Representatives for PHH and Element declined to comment.
