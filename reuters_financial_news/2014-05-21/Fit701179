May 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed 20 classes of notes from ten  transactions from the PUMA Series of Australian residential mortgage-backed  securities (RMBS). Fitch also revised Rating Outlooks on three classes to  Positive from Stable. The transactions are backed by pools of Australian  conforming residential mortgages originated by managers and brokers under the  PUMA securitisation programme. The rating actions are listed at the end of this  commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect Fitch's view that available credit enhancement supports  the notes at their current ratings, the agency's expectations of Australia's  economic conditions, and that the credit quality and performance of the loans in  the collateral pools remain in line with the agency's expectations. The Outlook  Revisions on the junior notes reflect that credit enhancement is expected to  build to levels that could trigger positive rating actions on the notes in  future if performance remains within expectations. The underlying pools of PUMA P-15, PUMA P-16, PUMA P-17, PUMA S-13, PUMA 2013-1  and PUMA 2014-1 consist of 100% full documentation mortgages. The underlying  pools of PUMA S-6 and PUMA S-7 consist of more than 90% of loans to  self-certified or stated income borrowers, while the proportion in PUMA S-9 and  PUMA S-10 is around 46%. Of the pools backed by full-documentation loans, 30+ day arrears were highest in  PUMA P-16 (0.8% as at 31 March 2014), below Fitch's 4Q13 Dinkum Index of 1.21%.  The transactions which include low-doc/no-doc loans had 30+ day arrears levels  ranging from 1.6% (PUMA S 10) to 8.7% (PUMA S-7), compared to Fitch's Low-doc  RMBS Index of 5.7%. All loans in the underlying portfolios have lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) in  place, provided mainly by QBE Lenders Mortgage Insurance Ltd (Insurer Financial  Strength Rating: 'AA-'/Stable) and Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty  Ltd. Losses have remained within expectations, with all losses submitted to LMI.  At end-March 2014, PUMA S-7 had the greatest dollar amount of submitted claims,  totalling AUD4.6m, with 91.9% of claims paid by LMI. Excluding PUMA S-7, the  weighted average pay-out ratio across the transactions was 99%. All claims  reductions to date have been paid by excess spread. The Fitch-calculated weighted average (WA) current LVR ranged from 55.2% (PUMA  S-6) to 70% (PUMA S-13). PUMA P-16 benefitted the most from indexation with WA  LVR improving to 50% from 59%. The least seasoned pools, PUMA 2013-1 (30 months)  and PUMA 2014 1 (23 months) had the highest WA indexed LVRs, at 64% and 65%  respectively. The WA seasoning across the remaining pools is at least seven  years. Principal is being allocated on a pro-rata basis in PUMA S-10 and PUMA S-13  according to the outstanding balance of the Class A, AB and B notes. As long as  the Class B1 notes are outstanding, it will receive the Class B2 notes' share of  principal collections. After the Class B1 note is paid in full, the Class AB  notes will receive Class B2's share of principal collections. The principal  repayment method would switch to sequential when either the collateral balance  reaches 10% of the original balance or the trust has sustained a loss which will  not be mitigated in a timely manner. This principal allocation mechanism has  resulted in increasing credit enhancement to the Class AB notes of each  transaction and is likely to see the respective notes' principal fully repaid  prior to full repayment of the senior notes.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A significant and unexpected increase in delinquencies, defaults and losses  would be necessary before any negative rating action would be considered. Credit  enhancement levels for the Class A notes across the transactions can support  many multiples of the arrears levels reported in the latest investor reports. Credit enhancement to the 'A+sf' rated Class B notes of PUMA P-16 has increased  since issuance due to the presence of a non-amortising first loss reserve.  Credit enhancement is expected to continue to build as the transaction reduces  in size and may reach a level where an upgrade is considered appropriate, if  assets continue to perform as expected.  Credit enhancement to the Class B1 notes of PUMA S-10 and PUMA S-13 (each rated  A+sf) has been increasing since issuance due to receiving the Class B2 notes'  share of principal allocations, while Class A and Class AB's credit enhancement  has remained stable. The expected continued build-up of credit enhancement may  eventually result in consideration of positive rating actions on the Class B1  notes, if assets continue to perform as expected. The ratings of most transactions' notes are independent of downgrades to the LMI  provider's ratings; the exceptions are Class B1 notes of PUMA S-10; Class AB and  B1 notes of PUMA S-13; and Class B notes of PUMA P-16.
