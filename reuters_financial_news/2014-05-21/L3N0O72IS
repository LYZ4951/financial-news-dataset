MUMBAI, May 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped a four-session winning streak on Wednesday as blue chips, including Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS>, retreated from recent strong gains a day after foreign investors turned net sellers for the first time in about a month.

Foreign investors sold Indian cash shares worth a net 1.04 billion rupees ($17.8 million) on Tuesday, their first selling since April 16, provisional exchange data showed. [ID:nI8N0NH02I] Investors took that milestone as an opportunity to take profits in recent outperformers, especially in domestic-oriented sectors that have led a powerful rally in anticipation of a victory for Bharatiya Janata Party and Narendra Modi, its candidate for prime minister. "I do not think the market would take profit-taking or small sales by FIIs seriously. FII interest in India has increased considerably on hopes that policy bottlenecks would be removed soon," said Arun Gopalan, vice-president of research and fund manager at Systematix Shares. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> fell 0.32 percent, or 78.86 points, to end at 24,298.02, retreating from a record closing high hit a day earlier.  The index still remains below the all-time high of 25,375.63 hit on Friday, when the BJP won a clear majority in the country's elections. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> lost 0.31 percent, or 22.60 points, to end at 7,252.90. Domestic-oriented stocks fell after leading the recent rally on expectations that a Modi-led government would pass major reforms to revive an economy growing at its slowest in a decade. Among capital goods makers, Larsen & Toubro declined 2.2 percent after marking its highest in 6-1/2 years in the previous session, while Bharat Heavy Electricals <BHEL.NS> lost 2.4 percent. UltraTech Cement <ULTC.NS> slumped 3.2 percent, while ACC <ACC.NS> fell 2.9 percent. The NSE bank sub-index <.NSEBANK> fell 1.1 percent, heading for a second day of falls on profit-taking after making a record closing high on Monday.  State Bank of India <SBI.NS> lost 2.7 percent, Axis Bank <AXBK.NS> ended down 2.3 percent, HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> fell 0.8 percent and ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> ended 0.6 percent lower. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd <SUN.NS> fell 1.8 percent after the USFDA said on Tuesday that the drugmaker's response to a U.S. import ban on one of its plants lacked "sufficient corrective actions." [ID:nL3N0O63YO] But among the gainers, Bajaj Auto Ltd <BAJA.NS> rose 5.1 percent after the motorcycle maker's management issued a better-than-expected outlook in a conference call with analysts.
