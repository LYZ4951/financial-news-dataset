FRANKFURT, May 21 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Magnetar Capital is suing U.S. drugs wholesaler McKesson <MCK.N> over the price it offered minority shareholders as part of its acquisition of German peer Celesio <CLSGn.DE>.

McKesson structured the transaction in an unlawful way, discriminating against minority shareholders, Magnetar said in a statement on Wednesday. While Celesio shareholders were offered 23.50 euros per share, convertible bond holders were paid the equivalent of up to 30.95 euros per underlying share, it added."Under the German minimum price protections, McKesson should have offered to pay over 370 million euros ($507 million) of additional consideration to minority shareholders and bondholders of Celesio," Magnetar said.
