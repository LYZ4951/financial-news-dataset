MILAN, May 21 (Reuters) - Financial spread betting firm IG Group is offering a grey market contract that allows traders to bet on Poste Italiane's market value at the close of its first trading day, now seen at 12.5 billion euros ($16.4 billion).

Earlier this year, Fabrizio Saccomanni, finance minister in the last government, said the sale of a 40 percent stake in the post office could raise 4.0-4.8 billion euros, a price analysts said would value the group at around 10-12 billion euros. Italy approved the sale plan last week as part of a wider privatisation drive to cut public debt. The sale is expected to be wrapped up this year.[ID:nL6N0O237W] The first bet using the grey market was placed at 12 billion euros, the top of the indicative range, said Vincenzo Longo, a strategist at IG. "Now it's rising, we are at 12.5 billion (euros)," Longo said. This is the first time IG has issued a pre-IPO contract on the grey market for an Italian company, he added.  "It's a good way to figure out what the market expects from this IPO," Longo said. IG has offered the same type of contracts for the IPOs of social network giants Facebook <FB.O> and Twitter <TWTR.N>, Britain's Royal Mail <RMG.L>, and still has one on offer for the planned IPO of China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <IPO-ALIB.N>.
