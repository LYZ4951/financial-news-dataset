Thailand's SET index <.SETI> closed 0.6 percent firmer, led by energy shares, after having fallen more than 1.1 percent in the previous session.

Thailand's army chief will meet leaders of rival political groups and parties, Election Commission members and senators later on Wednesday to discuss a way out of the country's political crisis, an army spokesman said.
