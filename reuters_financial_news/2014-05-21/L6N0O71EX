PRAGUE, May 21 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank approved investment group PPF's mandatory buyout offer price for shares of Telefonica Czech Republic <SPTT.PR>, it said in a document posted on its website.

The document laying out its decision did not include the approved price. A PPF spokesman declined to comment. PPF acquired a 65.9 percent stake in the Czech telecoms company from Spain's Telefonica <TEF.MC> earlier this year, paying 2.467 billion euros ($3.33 billion), or 305.6 crowns per share.
