LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank governor said on Wednesday he could not rule out the possibility of deflation in Poland and that the balance of risks toward joining the euro remained tilted to the negative.

"I cannot dismiss the possibility (of deflation)," Marek Belka told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. Belka declined to give a time frame for Poland's possible swing into deflationary territory.
