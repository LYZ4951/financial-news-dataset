May 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Thuringia's EUR250m bonds (DE000A11QS31), due 26 May 2021, an expected Long-term rating of 'AAA(EXP)'. This is Thuringia's fifth issue to be rated by Fitch. The senior unsecured bond ranks pari passu with all Thuringia's other outstanding debt. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects the strong support mechanisms that apply to all members of  the German Federation, including the State of Thuringia, and the extensive  liquidity facilities they benefit from, which ensure timely debt and debt  service payment.  The support mechanism applies uniformly to all members of the German Federation:  the Federal Republic of Germany (AAA/Stable) represented by the federal  government (Bund) and the 16 federated states, which includes the State of  Thuringia undertaking this issue. All Laender are equally entitled to financial  support in the event of financial distress irrespective of differences in  economic and financial performances. The new EUR250m issue's liquidity is underpinned by the safe cash management  system the Laender operate in, which allows overnight cash exchanges between  Laender and the Bund when necessary, and recourse to appropriate short-term  credit lines. The issue is zero risk-weighted and European Central Bank  repo-eligible. Thuringia is located in eastern Germany and had a population of about 2.2  million at end-2013. Its capital is the City of Erfurt. Its GDP of EUR51bn  accounted for almost 1.9% of national GDP in 2013. Its GDP per capita of  EUR23,168 is about 30% below Germany's average of EUR33,355. The unemployment  rate was 8% in April 2014, above that of Germany (6.8%) but well below that of  eastern Germany (10%).  RATING SENSITIVITIES
