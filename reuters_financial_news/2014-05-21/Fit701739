May 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Melsta Regal Finance Ltd's (MRF) National Long-Term rating at 'A+(lka)'. The Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS MRF's rating reflects Fitch's expectation that support would be forthcoming from  its ultimate parent, the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLC (DIST;  AAA(lka)/Stable). Fitch classifies MRF as being of limited importance to DIST,  which results in a rating differential of four notches.  The agency's assessment is based on DIST's full effective ownership of MRF  through its 100% stake in investment holding company Melstacorp Limited, which  holds all non-beverage sector assets of the group. It addition, DIST has  representation on MRF's board, and has demonstrated support in the form of  regular equity infusions, a back-up credit line and the provision of letters of  comfort for borrowings. The assessment however, also reflects MRF's still  insignificant role in the group, the low level of operational integration, the  absence of a common brand and relatively small contribution to group profit  (0.6% in the nine months ending December 2013. Fitch is of the view that linkages between the entities could increase over the  medium term as MRF, a licensed finance company, increases its scale through  actively taking part in the financial sector consolidation. The authorities also  require MRF to increase its capital base to LKR1.5bn by end-2017 (LKR1.1bn at  end March 2014). In addition MRF is required to list by end-2014 with an  expected public shareholding of around 20%. Fitch believes that DIST will  continue to retain a majority stake. MRF has expanded quickly since it started commercial operations in October 2012  as part of DIST group and Fitch expects that it will continue to growth rapidly.  Short-term debt factoring and working capital finance remain MRF's core  products, accounting for approximately 60% of advances in the financial year  ending March 2014, with the remainder comprising mainly finance leases and hire  purchase vehicle finance. DIST's ability to support MRF stems from its market leadership in the cash  generative domestic alcoholic beverage sector, with profitability supported by  relatively stable demand for spirits though economic cycles, and high entry  barriers as a result of regulation.   RATING SENSITIVITIES MRF's rating may be downgraded if there is a change to DIST's ability or  propensity to provide support. This may stem from a downgrade of DIST's National  Long-Term rating, or weakening linkages between DIST and MRF.
