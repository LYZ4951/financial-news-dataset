MILAN, May 21 (Reuters) - The top shareholder in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> has sold shares in the bank at 0.40 euros each, two traders said on Wednesday, as the stock lost 18 percent following news of the stake placement.

The banking foundation that owned more than 40 percent of the Genoa-based lender said on Tuesday it was aiming to sell 15 percent of Carige on the market. The price range initially set for the sale was of between 0.435 euros and 0.48 euros, market sources said. The stock had closed at 0.502 euros on Tuesday. Two traders said the foundation had not sold the entire 15 percent amount at the lower 0.40 euros a share price at which the sale was finalised.
