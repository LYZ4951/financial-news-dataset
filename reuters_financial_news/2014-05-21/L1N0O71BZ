May 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co <GE.N> Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on Wednesday that GE is still going to "work constructively" with the French government regarding its offer to acquire the power business of France's Alstom <ALSO.PA> and that he expects the deal to close.

GE has encountered resistance from the government in its $16.9 billion proposal, while Germany's Siemens <SIEGn.DE> looms as a potential rival bidder. But Immelt told an investor conference on Wednesday that, "We wouldn't have started if we didn't think we could finish."
