STOCKHOLM, May 21 (Reuters) - Tougher capital requirements for Swedish banks will limit the size of dividends they can pay out to shareholders, Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Wednesday.

"This places a clear limitation to dividends," Borg said at a banking seminar. Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said earlier on Wednesday a one percent countercyclical buffer for the country's banks was reasonable and that such a capital demand could be activated from summer 2015.
