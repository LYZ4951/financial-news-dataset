LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Three closely watched market indicators are showing investors turning more cautious on global equities, fearing the market may be ripe for a retreat after a two-year rally pushed a world index to an all-time high.

Investors are preferring defensive to cyclical shares and large to small caps, Datastream data showed. They are also taking profit of recent outperformers while switching into companies with strong balance sheets and earnings, the data showed. While none of these indicators is in itself the harbinger of a market fall, they signal investor appetite for risk is subsiding and history shows they tend to lead major market moves.  1) EUROPEAN CYCLICALS LAG DEFENSIVES  Shares which depend the most on economic activity, such as banks and travel firms, have begun to lag those which offer resilient earnings in good times and bad, such as pharma groups - a sign investors are taking a more cautious stance on the economy.  http://link.reuters.com/mag59v  2) U.S. LARGE CAPS OUTPERFORM SMALL CAPS The S&P 500 <.SPX>, a globally watched index which includes stalwarts such as Apple <AAPL.O> and General Electric <GE.N>, has outperformed small caps in the Russell 2000 index <.TOY> as investors leaned towards more established companies, generally seen as safer bets.http://link.reuters.com/huf59v  3) QUALITY OUTSHINES MOMENTUM The MSCI World Quality index of companies offering high return on equity, stable earnings growth and low financial leverage has started to outshine an index of stocks which performed strongly in the past 12 months, an investment style known as "momentum". This is a sign that investors are taking profit on recent gainers and seeking shelter in stocks that would outperform during a market fall. The MSCI World Index <.WORLD> hit an all-time high on May 13.
