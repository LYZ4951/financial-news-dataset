FRANKFURT, May 21 (Reuters) - Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> on Wednesday said it had suspended two foreign exchange traders under suspicion of having attempted to manipulate euro/zloty prices in regular trading.

The attempted manipulation took place in January and one trader was suspended in February, a spokesman for the bank said. Following an internal probe, a second trader was suspended in May, the spokesman said. The bank has discovered no evidence of any other attempts at the bank to manipulate currency prices, he said. Internal controls had identified the attempted manipulation, the spokesman said.
