STOCKHOLM, May 21 (Reuters) - Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said on Wednesday it deemed a one percent countercyclical buffer for the country's banks as reasonable and that such a capital demand could be introduced from summer 2015.

That would take total core tier one capital demands for Nordea <NDA.ST>, Handelsbanken <SHBa.ST>, Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> and SEB <SEBa.ST> to between 14 and 19 percent as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, or on average 16.4 percent, it said. "The capital demand should be especially high for the big, systemically important banks since the consequences should they run into trouble could be very serious for the broader economy," FSA chief Martin Andersson said in a statement on its website.
