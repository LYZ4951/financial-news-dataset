BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - European Union countries - except Sweden and the United Kingdom - on Wednesday reached a final agreement on setting up a common 55 billion euro ($75.3 billion) euro zone back-up fund to help shut down failing banks.

Europe wrapped up negotiations in late March on establishing a banking union, with the European Central Bank to take over as bank watchdog at the end of this year. [ID:nL6N0MH1ZM] Under the agreement signed on Wednesday, a back-up fund will be built up over eight years and reach a target level of at least 1 percent of banks' covered deposits. Levies will be collected from banks nationally and transferred to the Single Resolution Fund's so-called national compartments, which will be gradually merged.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  For FACTBOX on banking union please see:   [ID:nL6N0MH346]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
