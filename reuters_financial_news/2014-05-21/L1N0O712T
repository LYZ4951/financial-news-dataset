SAO PAULO, May 21 (Reuters) - Caixa Econômica Federal SA, Brazil's largest mortgage lender, expects loan defaults to fall this quarter after the indicator jumped to its highest level since at least 2010 in the first three months of the year, Chief Financial Officer Marcio Percival said on Wednesday.

Percival said in an interview to discuss the lender's first-quarter results, that Caixa's loan book will likely grow between 20 percent and 22 percent this year. In March, executives had set guidance of 22 percent to 25 percent for lending growth.
