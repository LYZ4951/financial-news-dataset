SEOUL, May 21 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> eased for a second straight session on Wednesday as offshore funds dumped the currency, a day after dollar-buying intervention by local authorities was spotted to stem the currency's strength in the previous session.

Dealers attributed the won's weakness to unwinding of short positions in the yen/won pair, with the won <JPYKRW=R> falling by more than 0.4 percent to the yen in the afternoon.  The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,026.9 per dollar at the end of onshore trade, down 0.2 percent from Tuesday's close at 1,025.3.  Seoul shares tracked Wall Street lower in a choppy session, with the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closing down 0.2 percent at 2,008.33 points. Foreign investors purchased a net 160 billion Korean won ($156 million) worth of KOSPI shares to position as net buyers for a seventh consecutive session, and underpinning the main bourse.
