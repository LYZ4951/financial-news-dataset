BEIJING, May 21 (Reuters) - China will speed up investment in major water conservancy  projects to support the economy while expanding a venture capital fund for new industries, the cabinet said on Wednesday.

The government will focus on strategic water saving and water supply projects, especially in the less developed central and western regions, the cabinet said in a statement after a regular meeting. "This will help increase the effective investment demand and support related industries and promote stable economic growth," it said. It also said the central government would increase the size of its venture capital fund to support new industries and establish a fund to support start-up businesses and small firms.
