MILAN, May 21 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> failed to start trading when markets opened on Wednesday and were indicated sharply lower following news that its top shareholder is placing a 15 percent stake on the market.

The banking foundation that owns more than 40 percent of the Genoa-based lender said on Tuesday it had started a private placement of Carige shares, ahead of a planned 800 million euro cash call at the bank next month. Reuters data showed an indicative price for the shares on 0.4190 euros, which would imply a 16.5 percent drop compared to a closing price of 0.502 euros on Tuesday.  A market source said on Tuesday the foundation would place the shares at a price of between 0.48 euros and 0.435 euros each. Traders earlier on Wednesday said the placement had not yet been completed and the price range may have been lowered.
