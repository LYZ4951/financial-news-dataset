May 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings Lanka has downgraded Singer  Finance (Lanka) PLC's <SIFI.CM> (SFL) National Long-Term rating to 'BBB(lka)' from  'BBB+(lka)'. The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also downgraded the National  Long-Term rating on SFL's outstanding senior debentures to 'BBB(lka)' from  'BBB+(lka)' .  The downgrade of SFL's rating follows the downgrade of its parent Singer (Sri  Lanka) PLC's <SINS.CM> (Singer) National Long-Term rating to 'A-(lka)' from 'A(lka)' on 19  May 2014. It reflects Singer's decreased ability to support SFL. Fitch continues  to view SFL as a strategically important subsidiary to Singer and maintains a  two-notch rating differential.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT  Fitch's expectation that Singer will support SFL is based on its strategic  importance to the parent. SFL provides financing for customers of Singer's  consumer electronic store. In addition, the two companies share a common brand,  Singer has majority shareholding in SFL and the parent has board representation  in the subsidiary. Singer has demonstrated support in the past in the form of  equity injection and borrowings and Fitch believes that having common creditors  provides an incentive for Singer to support SFL to avoid potential reputational  repercussions. Following the downgrade, SFL's rating also reflects its standalone credit  profile, which Fitch has assessed to be at the same rating level. SFL's  standalone credit profile reflects better capitalisation levels, modest  profitability and satisfactory asset-quality when compared with similarly rated  domestic peers. The debentures are rated at the same level as SFL's National Long-Term rating of  'BBB(lka)', as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations of the company.  RATING SENSITIVITIES- NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT  A weakening in SFL's intrinsic strength would only trigger a downgrade of its  National Long-Term rating if Singer's National Long-Term rating or its  propensity to support were to weaken. Sustained deterioration in SFL's  capitalisation and asset quality relative to its similarly rated peers would  result in a weakening of SFL's standalone credit profile. Fitch believes that the possibility for an upgrade of the rating would, while  not foreseen over the short-term, most likely result from a significant increase  in SFL's strategic importance to Singer. One indication for this could be closer  strategic alignment between the two entities resulting in consistently and  sustainably higher financing for Singer's customers.
