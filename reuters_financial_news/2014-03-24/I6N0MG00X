MILAN, March 24 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest bank UniCredit <CRDI.MI> has started to advertise a planned new hybrid dollar-denominated bond with investors at a roadshow that will last until Wednesday, one of the lead managers of the operation and a banking source said.

UniCredit, Citigroup, HSBC, Societe Generale and UBS will act as joint bookrunners for the perpetual Additional Tier 1 bond, which the Italian bank will use to boost its capital base.
