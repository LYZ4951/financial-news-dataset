SINGAPORE, March 24 (Reuters) - Singapore's Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd <TAHL.SI> has placed an order for 37 Airbus <AIR.PA> A320neo aircraft valued at $3.8 billion at list prices, taking delivery of the planes from 2018 to 2025, the carrier said in a statement on Monday.

Tiger said an existing order for nine Airbus A320 aircraft, part of a larger order agreed in 2007, will now be cancelled. These aircraft were originally scheduled for delivery in 2014 and 2015. The long-term fleet renewal and expansion comes as Tiger, which is about 40 percent-owned by Singapore Airlines Ltd <SIAL.SI>, takes steps to try to prevent a third straight year of losses. In January it sold its Tigerair Philippines business to Cebu Pacific, the archipelago's biggest airline, cutting its losses in a market where a sharp increase in available seats pushed down ticket prices.

"This deal effectively dissipates some concerns over a potential capacity overhang in the next couple of years." [ID:nSNZ7bC2JW]
