ZURICH, March 24 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank may introduce negative interest rates if the Swiss franc continues to appreciate, and should strengthen its capital to minimize the risk from its bloated balance sheet, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Monday.

"In case of renewed appreciation pressures, the IMF believes that the SNB could introduce negative interest rates on commercial banks' reserves," the IMF said in a statement published on the Swiss government's website. "In view of the SNB's balance sheet risks, further efforts to increase the bank's capital would be advisable according to the IMF," the statement said.
