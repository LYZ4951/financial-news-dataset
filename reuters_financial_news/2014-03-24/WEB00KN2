MUNICH, March 24 (Reuters) - German car rental firm Sixt <SIXG.DE> is not currently in merger talks with peer Europcar, Chief Executive Erich Sixt said at the group's annual press conference on Monday.

Europcar, owned by French investment fund Eurazeo <EURA.PA>, has hired investment bank Rothschild to launch an initial public offering (IPO), a French newspaper reported last week.
