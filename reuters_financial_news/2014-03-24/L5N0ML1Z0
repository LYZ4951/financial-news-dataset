CAIRO, March 24 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> did not change against the dollar at a central bank sale of foreign currency on Monday, but weakened on the black market.

The central bank sold $38.8 million to banks at the auction, with a cut-off price of 6.9501 pounds to the dollar, the same price as the last sale on Thursday. <CBOE>  On the black market, the dollar was offered at 7.39 pounds on Monday, weaker than Thursday's rate of 7.37, one market participant said.  The pound has been under pressure during three years of political turmoil. Egypt's foreign currency reserves stood at about $17.3 billion pounds in February, down from $36 billion before the uprising that led to President Hosni Mubarak's overthrow in 2011.
