March 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Telefonica SA's <TEF.MC> (TEF, BBB+/Negative) proposed EUR benchmark perpetual subordinated securities an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)'. The securities will be issued by Telefonica Europe B.V. [TEFBV.UL] and guaranteed on a subordinated basis by Telefonica SA. The final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming materially to the preliminary documentation. The upcoming hybrid securities are proposed to be deeply subordinated and to  rank senior only to TEF's share capital, while coupon payments can be deferred  at the discretion of the issuer. As a result of these features, the 'BBB-(EXP)'  rating is two notches below TEF's Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR), which  reflects the securities' increased loss severity and heightened risk of  non-performance relative to senior obligations. This approach is in accordance  with Fitch's criteria, "Treatment and Notching of Hybrid in Non-financial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis" dated 23 December 2013 at  www.fitchratings.com.  The proposed securities qualify for 50% equity credit as they meet Fitch's  criteria with regard to subordination, effective maturity of at least five  years, full discretion to defer coupons for at least five years and limited  events of default, as well as the absence of material covenants and look-back  provisions.  The proposed securities will be issued in EUR and have no formal maturity date.  The documentation provides for the potential issuance of two tranches, a  non-call 6 (NC6) and non-call 10 (NC10). The issuer has a call option to redeem  the notes at par on the first call date (in 2020 for the NC6 and in 2024 for the  NC10) and at any interest payment date thereafter.  There will be a coupon step-up of 25bps from year ten onwards (2024) and an  additional step-up of 75bps 20 years after the first call date onwards (in 2040  for the NC6 and in 2044 for the NC10). According to Fitch's criteria, the first  call date and the coupon step-up date are not treated as effective maturity  dates due to the cumulative amount of the step-ups being lower or equal to 1%  throughout the life of the instruments. However, the issuer will no longer be  subject to replacement language disclosing the company's intent to redeem the  instrument from 2040 (for the NC6) and 2044 (for the NC10) with the proceeds of  a similar instrument or with equity. Hence, 2040 and 2044 are viewed as the  respective effective maturity date for the NC6 and NC10 securities. The  instrument's equity credit would switch to zero five years prior to this date  (i.e. in 2035 for the NC6 and 2039 for the NC10). There is no look-back provision in the securities' documentation, which gives  the issuer full discretion to unilaterally defer coupon payments. Deferrals of  coupon payments are cumulative and the company will be obliged to make a  mandatory settlement of deferred interest payments under certain circumstances,  including a declaration or payment of a dividend.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Proactive Portfolio Management & Deleveraging A spike in leverage, following the 2010 Vivo acquisition and coincident economic  slowdown, has been managed well. A combination of material cuts to its  distribution policy, the sale of non-core assets and stake sales, along with  hybrid issuance has seen the company reduce net debt to EUR46.6bn (EUR43.6bn  adjusted for post FY13 disposals) - i.e. adjusted for 50% equity credit assigned  to the hybrid instruments. This compares with debt of EUR56.3bn at FYE11. Fitch  expects funds from operations (FFO) net adjusted leverage to stabilise around  3.3x in 2014 and beyond, a level that is consistent with the large European  incumbent peer group and a 'BBB+' rating.  FFO net adjusted leverage was 3.2x at  FYE13. Positive Diversification, Telefonica exhibits stronger portfolio diversification than similarly rated  peers, such as Deutsche Telekom and Orange SA. Of this group, Telefonica is  least reliant on its domestic market at 45% contribution to operating cash flow  (OCF; EBITDA less capex) from Spain in 2013, compared with Deutsche Telekom's  70% from Germany and Orange's 65% from France. Fitch estimates that following  the E-Plus transaction (which remains subject to regulatory approval), Germany  will account for 9% and the UK a 10% contribution - boosting the cash flow from  competitive but nonetheless stronger performing northern European economies,  while Latin America will contribute 39%. Such broad diversification offers  protection against economic cycles as well as structural shifts and maturing  regional trends.Domestic Operating Environment Remains Tough Spain is still Telefonica's single largest market, accounting for 43% of  forecast 2014 OCF. A domestic economy characterised by high unemployment and  weak domestic consumption, along with an increasingly tough competitive  environment will continue to weigh on this part of the business. Telefonica's  "Fusion" quad-play product has fundamentally shifted pricing in the market,  though without slowing the pace of mobile subscriber losses. The incumbent lost  a total of 1.6 million mobile customers in the 12 months to December 2013, while  mobile service revenues contracted by 16%. Aggressive MVNO mobile offers have  had a significant impact on the established operators, while Vodafone's  acquisition of ONO, the country's largest cable operator, is likely to increase  fixed line and quad-play pressures. Domestic EBITDA fell 7% in 2013. Further  contraction is likely in 2014 and may continue beyond, in Fitch's view.  FX Headwinds Currency volatility primarily related to Telefonica's Latin American businesses  had a material impact on 2013 reported results - revenues suffered a negative  EUR5bn currency impact; with a EUR1.7bn effect felt at the EBITDA level.  Currency devaluation in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela has been significant,  with the prospect of any near-term easing in these pressures far from certain.  While its LatAm operations generally report top-line growth and solid underlying  performance, currency volatility removed the underlying growth benefits of the  LatAm business in 2013 and in the absence of any material appreciation will  continue to impact reported group level results in 2014.  Fitch estimates that LatAm countries in 2014 will account for around 39% of  Telefonica's OCF and their currencies at 8% of group debt, giving rise to a  currency mismatch. Euro zone countries are forecast to represent 52% of OCF,  compared with an estimated 80% of euro-dominated debt.   Measured M&A Approach M&A risk at Telefonica is viewed by Fitch as measured and its intentions in this  area have been well-articulated by management. Recent activity has focused on  the sale of non-core operations with the agreed disposal of businesses in the  Czech Republic and Ireland expected to raise around EUR3bn in proceeds in 2014.  Disposal proceeds along with approximately EUR900m to be raised from minorities  (at the Telefonica Deutschland level) in a rights issue accompanying the E-Plus  acquisition will offset the EUR5bn cash component of the German acquisition. The  company's leverage neutral approach to funding this deal underlines caution in  financial policies, which Fitch views positively. The possibility of market  consolidation in Brazil would be a transaction that makes strategic sense -  regulatory barriers to such a development are though considered high.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating actions  include: -FFO net adjusted leverage approaching 3.5x with little expectation that  deleveraging comfortably below this level can be achieved organically.  Mid-single digit or below pre-dividend FCF margin would increase downgrade  pressure.   Positive: Future developments that could lead to a revision of the Outlook to  Stable, are: - FFO net adjusted leverage well below 3.5x on a sustained basis. A mid-to-high  single digit pre-dividend free cash flow (FCF) margin, which is also deemed an  important metric at 'BBB+', on a consistent basis is likely to help stabilise  the Outlook The following ratings are affirmed:- Telefonica SA Long term IDR: 'BBB+'; Negative Outlook Telefonica SA Short term IDR: 'F2' Telefonica Europe BV's/Telefonica Emisiones' bonds: 'BBB+' Telefonica Finance USA LLC's preference shares: 'BB+'
