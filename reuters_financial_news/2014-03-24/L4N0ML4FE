MELBOURNE, March 25 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open lower on Tuesday, giving up gains from the previous session after Wall Street tumbled on escalating tension in Ukraine and with investors uncertain on whether China will move to shore up growth.

* Share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.6 percent to 5,315, a 31.9-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>. The benchmark rose 0.2 percent on Monday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 0.3 percent to 5,101.7 in early trade. * U.S. stocks fell on Monday, with some of the market's recent best performers like technology and biotech shares leading the way down. Concerns the crisis in Ukraine could escalate gave investors a reason to drop some trading favorites. * U.S. President Barack Obama and major industrialised allies warned Russia on Monday it faced damaging economic sanctions if President Vladimir Putin takes further action in Ukraine following the seizure of Crimea. * Copper steadied on Monday as investors saw last week's fall to 3-1/2 year lows as overdone and as the latest batch of weak data from China spurred hopes that authorities would introduce measures to support the economy.  * Gold prices tumbled about 2 percent, the biggest one-day drop in nearly two months, as hedge funds dumped the precious metal on bets that rising U.S. interest rates could spark a further retreat from last week's six-month high.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2116 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1857.44 -0.49%-9.080 USD/JPY <JPY=>   102.2   -0.03%-0.030 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.7299  ---0.020 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1308.12 -1.94%   -25.820 US CRUDE<CLc1>   99.42   -0.04%-0.040 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16276.69-0.16%-26.08 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  137.85   0.04%  0.06 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Tech leads Wall St lower as Ukraine casts a shadow  [.N]   * Brent crude falls on weak China data in volatile trade [O/R]   * Gold drops 2 pct on fund selling, US rate hike fears  [GOL/]   * Copper steadies as China stimulus hopes lend support [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB] DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
