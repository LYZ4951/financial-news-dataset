HONG KONG, March 24 (Reuters) - China shares listed in Hong Kong extended gains on Monday to reach a two-week high on expectations the Chinese government could unveil stimulus measures after a weak factory survey.

The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong rose 2.8 percent to 9,695 points, its largest daily gain since Nov. 18. The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed up 1.9 percent at 21,846.5, its best day since Nov. 18. Short-covering by investors in the energy sector also lifted the H-share index, with heavyweight Petrochina <0857.HK> <600857.SS> up 5.5 percent in Hong Kong. Ports-to-telecoms conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa <0013.HK> fell 5.1 percent, its worst day since October 2011, after it announced Singapore state investor Temasek holdings agreed to buy a 24.9 percent stake in its retail business A.S. Watson for about HK$44 billion ($5.67 billion).
