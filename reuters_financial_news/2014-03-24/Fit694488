March 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed six Medallion Trust Series RMBS transactions, with 22 tranches affirmed and one tranche upgraded. These transactions are backed by pools of Australian residential mortgages originated by Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> (CBA; AA-/Stable/F1+), and Homepath Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of CBA that originates home loans online). The rating actions are at the end of this commentary.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  The affirmations reflect Fitch's view that credit enhancement levels are able to  support the notes' current ratings and the agency's expectations of Australia's  economic conditions, with the Medallion Series Trust 2013-1 Class B notes  upgraded due to a build-up of credit enhancement for the note sufficient to  achieve a rating of 'AAsf'. The credit quality and performance of the loans in  the respective collateral pools remain in line with the agency's expectations. Medallion Trust Series 2006-1G [MDLTG.UL] and Medallion Trust Series 2007-1G [MDLTH.UL] are currently paying down on a pro-rata basis, with principal collections for these  transactions being allocated across all classes of notes with the exception of  the Class A-4 note in Medallion Trust Series 2007-1G. Medallion Trust Series  2011-1, 2012-1, 2013-1 and 2013-2 are each currently paying down on a sequential  basis. All transactions have lender's mortgage insurance (LMI) provided by  Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty Ltd or QBE Lenders' Mortgage Insurance  Limited (AA-/Stable) with cover ranging from 14.8% to 100% of the portfolios.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  In Fitch's rating sensitivity analysis, the likelihood of a downgrade of the  senior note classes is remote, based on each respective note's performance and  structure.  Initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the  new issue reports for Series 2012-1, 2013-1 and 2013-2 dated 20 August 2012, 10  March 2013 and 30 August 2013 respectively.
