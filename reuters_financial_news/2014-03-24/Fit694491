March 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Australia's Long-Term  Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'AAA'. The issue ratings on Australia's  senior unsecured local currency bonds are also affirmed at 'AAA'. The Outlooks  on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. The Country Ceiling is affirmed at 'AAA' and  the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F1+'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The affirmation of Australia's sovereign ratings reflects the following factors: Australia's economy rests on strong underlying economic and institutional  fundamentals, including a strongly developed, high-income and flexible economy,  supported by a credible policy framework and effective political and social  institutions. This provides for a high degree of resiliency to shocks. Australia's real GDP growth is high relative to peers. The average real GDP  growth rate of 2.4% over the past five years, that included the global financial  crisis, is double the 'AAA' peer rating group median (1.2%). Although the end of  the mining investment boom that supported growth over the past years has now set  in and there are still substantial uncertainties surrounding the outlook, Fitch  expects GDP growth to hold up quite well: 2.6% for 2014 and 2.8% for 2015. The public debt burden is relatively low at 27.6% of GDP. This fiscal strength  relative to peers is likely to be reinforced by the fiscal consolidation that is  expected in the coming years. Fitch expects the general government budget  deficit, combining the central and state government balances, to rise to 4.1% of  GDP in the financial year ending 30 June 2014 (FY14), before falling to 2.5% of  GDP in FY15. The relatively new central government is in the process of  preparing its first federal budget to be presented on 13 May. It has not  announced any concrete measures yet, but the budget is likely to include  significant spending cuts on the basis of recommendations by the National  Commission of Audit. In the next two years or so, the consolidation may turn out  stronger than indicated by the numbers in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal  Outlook  of December 2013. The Reserve Bank of Australia views the pick-up in the housing market as a  welcome substitute for the mining investment boom and central in the  transmission of the accommodative monetary policy. House prices increased by  close to 10% in 2013 nationwide and by 14% over the last 12 months in Sydney. So  far, credit growth has not picked up substantially, with growth in total credit  of 4.1% yoy and housing credit of 5.6% yoy in January. A sustained housing  market boom may, nonetheless, lead to a build-up of vulnerabilities, which could  at some stage impact GDP growth and bank balance sheets. The banking sector remains resilient. Major banks' capital holdings are  currently rising and their profitability is expected to remain solid through  2014, providing a buffer to absorb a possible asset quality deterioration. The  system seems well-supervised. Australia is one of only three countries that  attract Fitch's highest banking system indicator (BSI) score of 'aa'. The external sector generally remains a weakness relative to peers. Fitch  expects a current account deficit of 3.2% of GDP for 2014, while the 'AAA' peer  median is a 6.0% surplus. The basic balance (current account plus FDI) shows a  deficit, which is expected to widen slightly as mining investment declines. Net  external debt (close to 50% of GDP in 2013) is more than double the median for  'AAA' peers (21%) and is forecast to increase further. Exchange rate flexibility  is a strength, however.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Since the Outlook is Stable, Fitch does not currently anticipate developments  with a high likelihood of leading to a rating change. However, future  developments that could individually or collectively, result in a downgrade of  the ratings include: - Deterioration in external balances. Due to Australia's strong commodity  dependence, a sustained and rapid deterioration in the terms of trade, most  likely in the context of a severe slowdown in China, could have a strong impact  on the current account, as well as on economic growth and public finances. - Large-scale problems in the banking sector. Such difficulties could result  from severe asset quality deterioration - e.g. in the context of a severe  slowdown in China - and could lead to a sudden loss of investor confidence,  which would negatively impact wholesale refinancing. - Failing economic rebalancing. The end of the mining investment boom puts  pressure on other sectors to support growth through increased productivity and  competitiveness. A sustained period of very low real GDP growth and increasing  unemployment would negatively impact the public and financial sector balances.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS The ratings and Outlooks are sensitive to a number of assumptions: - The global economic environment remains conducive for global trade and  investment flows. In particular Fitch assumes commodity prices do not suffer a  sharp correction and that China, which has become a key destination for  Australian exports, does not experience a sharp and severe economic downturn.  - Fitch's forecasts for the general government balance and debt levels are based  on the assumption that the Australian authorities remain committed to sound  fiscal management.
