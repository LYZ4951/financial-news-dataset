LONDON, March 24 (Reuters) - Jupiter Fund Management <JUP.L> Chief Executive Maarten Slendebroek said his firm's Scottish business would prosper regardless of the outcome of a September referendum on breaking away from the UK.

"While the uncertainty regarding Scotland's future is a concern for business in the short term, we see a significant long term business opportunity for Jupiter in Scotland," said Slendebroek, who took up his position on March 17. "It has a vibrant financial services sector and is home to many of the wealth management clients we are targeting. That will not change, regardless of the outcome of a referendum," he added in emailed comments to Reuters. [ID:nL6N0JO1CD]
