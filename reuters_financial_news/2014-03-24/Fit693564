March 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that recent changes  to the pension and broader public finance frameworks are neutral for Poland's  sovereign ratings (A-/A/Stable). Fitch's assessment of Poland's sovereign  creditworthiness will continue to focus on underlying fiscal consolidation, as  well as reduction of external indebtedness and income convergence.  The most substantial amendment, at least in the short term, is the transfer to  the publicly-run pay-as-you-go pillar (PAYG) of 51.5% of financial assets held  by open pension funds (OFEs), which took place in February 2014. OFEs have been  financed by a portion of gross wage contributions, which they used to accumulate  financial assets. Other changes include making future contributions to OFEs  optional rather than mandatory and the transfer to the PAYG system of all funds  10 years before retirement. Fitch estimates that the transfer of OFE assets reduces the gross general  government debt (GGGD) ratio (on a ESA 95 basis) by 7.5 percentage points. The  agency judges this development to be rating-neutral given that the reduction in  public debt (as well as debt-servicing costs) is offset by an increase in  long-term state pension liabilities. The changes are being challenged at the  Constitutional Court, but Fitch does not expect this to result in a major  reversal, including for instance the cancellation of the asset transfer.  The changes to the pension system came amid an increasing debt burden and  mounting external pressure to narrow the budget deficit in the context of the  EU's Excessive Deficit Procedure. The diversion of a part of gross wage  contributions from the PAYG pillar to finance OFEs created a gap in the social  security budget that had to be filled via increased public debt issuance, in the  partial absence of other fiscal consolidation measures. This built up a  considerable additional public debt burden, and in recent years public debt  (calculated by the government using a separate methodology) had been hovering  close to 55% of GDP, a key legal threshold.  A new stabilising expenditure rule (SER) in effect starting with the 2014 budget  aims to boost the anti-cyclical role of public spending and introduces debt  thresholds at 43% and 48% of GDP. The SER was adopted to comply with enhanced  EU-level fiscal surveillance and could support increased fiscal discipline.  However, the suspension of a previous rule to enable the revision of the 2013  budget, as well as the likelihood that public debt will remain in breach of the  lower threshold for several years against a backdrop of fiscal austerity, raises  the risk that fiscal rules may be breached in future.
