MUMBAI, Mar 24 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose as much as 1.2 percent on Monday to a record high, surpassing its previous all-time high hit just last week, as lenders including ICICI Bank extended a recent rally on the back of strong foreign investor flows.

The NSE's bank sub-index <.NSEBANK> has surged around 14 percent so far this month, outperforming the nearly 5 percent gain in the NSE index <.NSEI>.  Analysts have cited heavy buying by foreign investors into a sector that last year under-performed the broader index, while expectations the Reserve Bank of India would keep interest rates on hold at its policy review on April 1 are also aiding the gains. The NSE index rose to an all time high of 6,575.80 points, and was up 1.2 percent at 0418 GMT, surpassing its previous all-time high hit on March 18.  The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> was up 1.2 percent, just a few points shy of making a new record high.
