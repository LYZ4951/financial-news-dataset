RIO DE JANEIRO, March 24 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on Monday it does not expect to further cut Brazil's credit rating in the short term after downgrading the country to its lowest investment-grade level.

"We just revised Brazil's outlook to stable, we don't expect any more changes in the short term," S&P's analyst Lisa Schineller told reporters in a teleconference. "We are very comfortable with Brazil at an investment-grade category."
