SYDNEY, March 24 (Reuters) - Australian shares reversed early losses to rise 0.2 percent on Monday as investors piled into cheaper banks and resource stocks, though gains were capped as a manufacturing PMI survey for China showed reduced activity for March. [ID:nL4N0MK0I3]

Activity in China's factories shrank again in March as output and new orders both weakened, a preliminary private survey showed. The flash Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index fell to an eight-month low of 48.1 in March from February's final reading of 48.5.
