MUMBAI, March 24 (Reuters) - Indian shares jumped nearly 1.5 percent on Monday to record highs, surpassing their previous all-time highs hit just last week, as lenders including ICICI Bank extended a recent rally on the back of strong foreign investor flows.

The broader NSE index <.NSEI> ended 1.34 percent higher after marking a lifetime high of 6,591.50, while the benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> finished 1.38 percent up after touching a record high of 22,074.34, surpassing their previous milestones hit on March 18. Banks led the gains on optimism about a recovery in the domestic economy and bets the Reserve Bank of India would keep interest rates on hold for now at its policy review on April 1.
