COLOMBO, March 24 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares slipped on Monday from their week-high, with heavyweight Ceylon Tobacco Co Plc <CTC.CM> falling 5 percent, and trading volumes continued to suffer ahead of an impending U.N. resolution on the country's human rights record.

The main stock index <.CSE> closed down 0.26 percent, or 15.64 points, at 5,922.23.  The index had ended Friday at its highest close since March 11. Monday's turnover was 197.9 million rupees ($1.52 million) - less than a quarter of this year's daily average of 869.5 million rupees. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth 12.6 million rupees.  Sri Lanka's 2.47 trillion rupee ($18.94 billion) bourse has seen a net outflow of 4.1 billion rupees so far this year. It reported a 22.88 billion rupee inflow in 2013. Ceylon Tobacco shares fell 5.5 percent to 1,031.90 rupees, with only 35 shares traded. Analysts said investor sentiment has been dented on concerns of a resolution that could hurt the country's economy.  Several potential buyers of risky assets are awaiting a clear direction.
