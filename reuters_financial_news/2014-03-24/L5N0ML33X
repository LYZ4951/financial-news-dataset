DUBAI, March 24 (Reuters) - Dubai's bourse ended a six-day rally on Monday as retail investors took profits, while banks dragged down Bahrain after a merger in the sector fell apart. The rest of the region was mixed.

The main Dubai market index <.DFMGI> opened higher but then moved into the red as heavyweight Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> slid 0.8 percent in low-volume trading. Other property-related names and small-cap stocks favoured by retail investors followed suit, and the index closed down 0.7 percent. Some of Dubai's real estate names were still in the black, however; Union Properties <UPRO.DU> rose 1.0 percent and Deyaar <DEYR.DU> gained 0.8 percent. Abu Dhabi's bourse closed up 0.2 percent thanks to blue chips such as National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, which added 1.8 percent. Bank of Sharjah <BOS.AD> dropped 6.6 percent after going ex-dividend.  BAHRAIN BANKS Bahrain's bourse <.BAX> was the Gulf's biggest loser on Monday, shedding 1.4 percent.  Khaleeji Commercial Bank <KHCB.BH> fell 2.0 percent after the lender and unlisted Bank Al Khair failed to agree on the terms of a merger and dropped the plan. The central bank has been encouraging mergers to help the sector recover from a real estate crash and political unrest that erupted in 2011. [ID:nL5N0ML0TJ] Arab Banking Corp <ABCB.BH> plunged its daily limit of 10 percent as it went ex-dividend. It jumped its daily limit for five straight sessions earlier this month in anticipation of its 5 U.S. cents a share dividend. "This is the first time since 2007 that the bank distributes a cash dividend. The movement in the stock over the last few weeks reflects market expectations regarding this dividend," brokerage Mubasher said in an email. Meanwhile Qatar's bourse <.QSI> slid 0.7 percent, down for a fourth straight session. Local individual investors and institutions as well as foreign retail investors were all net sellers on Monday; foreign institutions were buying. Kuwait's Agility <AGLT.KW>, the largest logistics group in the Gulf Arab region, surged 7.4 percent after the company reported a 37 percent rise in 2013 net profit and proposed a higher cash dividend of 40 fils per share plus 5 percent bonus shares. It was the third most heavily traded stock in Kuwait.[ID:nL5N0ML1C0]  MONDAY'S HIGHLIGHTSDUBAI * The index <.DFMGI> fell 0.7 percent to 4,318 points.
