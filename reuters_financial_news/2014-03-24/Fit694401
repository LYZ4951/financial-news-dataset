March 24 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed industrial company Servus Holdco S.a.r.l. Luxembourg's (Stabilus) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B' with Stable Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed the instrument rating for the EUR315m senior secured notes issued by Servus Luxembourg Holding S.C.A. at  'B+'/Recovery Rating 'RR3'.  The affirmation reflects Stabilus's balanced business profile, stable operating  and cash flow performance over the past four years, as well as Fitch's  expectation that the company will continue to achieve its growth objectives  through expansion into adjacent markets and new product launches on upcoming  vehicle platforms with long-standing original equipment manufacturer (OEM)  customers. Principal constraints to the rating profile remain the group's high  leverage and slow projected deleveraging, cyclicality in some of its end-markets  and the risk associated with its strategy in the powerise segment.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Slow Deleveraging Expected  Fitch expects Stabilus will continue to execute its original business plan by  expanding through new business wins, particularly with Asian OEMs that will also  serve to improve the company's geographic sales diversity. However, the  sustained growth and increased profitability have yet to translate into material  credit metric improvement and Fitch projects funds from operations (FFO)  adjusted leverage will remain near 4.5x for the foreseeable future.  Balanced, Resilient Profile Stabilus is the market leader in its main and commoditised product - gas springs  - with significantly greater market share than its nearest competitors. As a  result, the company enjoys considerable economies of scale and sound cash  generation. The ratings are further supported by Stabilus's broader business  profile which shows a mix between mature and growth products in both automotive  and industrial applications, with limited customer concentration. This helps  provide a buffer against the high demand volatility and cyclicality that  characterise the mature markers Stabilus operates. Given Stabilus's high  fixed-cost base a sustained decline in demand would hurt profitability and cash  flow generation.  Competitive Threats Remain Stabilus has successfully positioned itself as a favoured supplier of automated,  electro-mechanical opening and closing systems, and as a result, has become  increasingly important to OEMs' supply chains. However, in this segment,  Stabilus competes with larger and more diversified suppliers, which Fitch  expects will react to the company's ambitious growth plans. In addition, this  segment is likely to see higher R&D and capex requirements in future, which will  hold back the company's deleveraging efforts.  Cash Flow Fluctuation  Stabilus has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) margins over the past four  years. However, it faces increased interest expenses under its newly issued  notes and higher capital expenditures related to the build-out of Chinese  facilities and other capacity expansion efforts. Like most industrial producers,  Stabilus experiences seasonal working capital volatility; outflows are heaviest  during the early parts of the year.   Sufficient Financial Flexibility Fitch views Stabilus's liquidity position as adequate with sufficient financial  flexibility. Stabilus had EUR11.2m of cash on balance sheet at end-December 2013  (versus EUR21.8m at FY to September 2013), due to seasonal working capital  outflows and expansionary capital expenditure. As such, EUR8m has also been  drawn on the company's super senior EUR25m revolving credit facility (RCF) as of  end-1Q FY14. Fitch projects the company will continue to generate FCF, and as a  result, cash liquidity is expected to gradually improve over the intermediate  term.  Strong Credit Recovery The senior secured notes' 'B+'/'RR3' rating reflects Fitch's expectation of  above-average recoveries in the range of 51%-70%. The instrument rating takes  into account the EUR25m super-senior RCF and up to EUR7.5m of indemnities, both  ranking ahead of the bond. Instrument ratings for the super senior RCF have not  been requested but would be capped at 'RR2' indicating 90% recovery prospects,  given Luxembourg jurisdiction.  Driving these recovery expectations is an estimated post restructuring EBITDA at  approximately 35% below Stabilus's LTM 1Q FY14 EBITDA. This is to reflect a  hypothetical adverse scenario of depressed sales and compressed margins due to  high operational leverage and earnings cyclicality. This, in combination with an  estimated going concern multiple of 5x enterprise value/ EBITDA, results in a  more favourable valuation than the agency's alternative estimation of a  liquidation scenario.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: The ratings could be upgraded if Stabilus continues to successfully execute its  growth strategy while also enhancing product and geographic diversification,  combined with FFO adjusted leverage sustainably below 4x and FFO interest  coverage improving to 3.5x (FY14 forecast: 3.0x).
