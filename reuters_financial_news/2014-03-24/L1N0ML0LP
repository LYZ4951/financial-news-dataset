SAO PAULO, March 24 (Reuters) - Febraban, the lobbying group representing Brazilian banks, nominated Murilo Portugal as executive president for a second term, according to a statement on Monday.

The Sao Paulo-based group will hold a vote to elect its president on March 31, a move that is usually seen as ceremonial. The re-election of Portugal, a former finance ministry official, was formally proposed by Febraban's board, which is presided over by Roberto Setubal, chief executive officer of Itau Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA>. During his first, three-year term, Portugal and Febraban faced strong criticism from government officials because of the group's stance over the implementation of a government-sponsored reduction in lending interest rates and the use of a privately-owned deposit guarantee fund to bail out failed banks.
