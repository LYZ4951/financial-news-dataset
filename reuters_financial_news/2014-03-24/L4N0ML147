SEOUL, March 24 (Reuters) - Seoul shares rose for a second session on Monday, closing at a near two-week high as foreigners bought up bargains but a  survey highlighting weakness in China's manufacturing sector limited the stock market's gains.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.6 percent at 1,945.55 points on Monday, its highest closing level since March 11.
