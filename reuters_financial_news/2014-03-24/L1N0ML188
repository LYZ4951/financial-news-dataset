WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities have put conditions on CoreLogic Inc's <CLGX.N> proposed $661 million buy of DataQuick Information Systems after assessing that the deal would limit  competition in the market for certain bulk real estate data.

The Federal Trade Commission's proposed settlement order requires CoreLogic to license to Renwood RealtyTrac, its national assessor and recorder bulk data as well as several ancillary data sets that DataQuick provides to its customers.
