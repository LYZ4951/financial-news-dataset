March 24 (Reuters) - Bulgarian banks have enough capital to pass a European Union-wide stress test in 2014 and a gradual economic recovery will help reduce their bad loan burden, deputy central bank governor Kalin Hristov told Reuters.

The Balkan country's banks, three-quarters of which are foreign owned, will undergo local and EU-wide tests of lenders' ability to withstand a future crisis without resorting to expensive bailouts funded by the taxpayer. Bulgarian banks' capital adequacy was 16.85 percent at the end of 2013, well above the country's new solvency rules that set a 13.5 percent threshold on total capital adequacy, based on EU standards, Hristov said in a weekend interview. "I do not expect any of the banks here, either subsidiaries of euro zone country (banks) that will be also subject to the ECB's asset quality reviews, or local banks, to show a need to bolster capital," he said. Many European banks have been raising funds, shedding assets and writing off bad debts before the ECB's stress tests to help plug capital shortfalls worth hundreds of billions of euros. Some units of euro zone banks that operate in Bulgaria, like the biggest lender, Unicredit Bulbank, will also undergo the European Central Bank's asset quality review before the ECB starts supervising euro zone banks in November. Bulgaria, the EU's poorest country, does not have a target date for adopting the euro, saying it must first get its economy growing steadily and be confident the currency bloc is stable. It has kept tight control of its banks since an economic and financial meltdown in 1998, which wiped out a third of its lenders and prompted the government to peg the lev currency to the euro. Bulgarian banks did not need big bailouts in the 2008-09 financial crisis, but even so lending fell and bad loans spiked, rising to 16.9 percent by the end of 2013. The country's health checks on its banks will be similar to the ECB's, said Hristov, a former finance minister. "The rules are common, and what matters is whether the institutions have enough experience and expertise. We have proven through the years that we have both. We will remain a strong and conservative supervisor," he said.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY TO RISE There are 29 commercial banks and bank branches operating in Bulgaria. Major lenders include Unicredit Bulbank, controlled by Unicredit <CRDI.MI>, DSK Bank, controlled by Hungary's OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> and local FIBank <5F4.BB>. Hristov said the easing of risk weights in the new rules means the total capital adequacy of Bulgarian banks is expected to further increase by about 2 percentage points. The new rules however will force banks to get all specific provisions on bad loans reintegrated into their capital and account for them in their profit and loss statements, and some of the banks may show one-off negative results, Hristov said. "This will be a presentation effect, and not ... a result of a change in their financial situation," he said.
