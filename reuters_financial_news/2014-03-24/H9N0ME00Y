March 24 (Reuters) - Property developer Greentown China <3900.HK> is on the lookout for acquisition opportunities as small developers fail, and plans various promotions to clear inventories as a credit crunch bites, a top company official said on Monday.

Chief Executive Shou Bainian told a news conference to discuss earnings that the company did not plan extensive price cuts as part of the promotion campaign, however.
