HANOI, March 24 (Reuters) - Vietnam's VN Index <.VNI> closed up 0.96 percent on Monday at 607.55 points, its highest in 53 months, with investors in positive mood ahead of a property market lending boost and first-quarter earnings reports.

Banks saw the strongest gains, with a 2.25-percent rise for Vietcombank <VCB.HM>, the biggest lender by market capitalisation and 4.5 percent increase for Sacombank <STB.HM>. Eximbank <EIB.HM> was up 3.47 percent and Military Bank <MBB.HM> rose 2.44 percent. "Local investors are putting money into the market on hopes of good corporate results in the first quarter of 2014," analyst Vu Duy Khanh at Navibank Securities said. The reports are due in April. Gains on the index were driven in part by news in local media of a 50 trillion dong ($2.4 billion) loan package to be offered by the Vietnam Construction Bank, aimed at reviving a sluggish real estate market.
