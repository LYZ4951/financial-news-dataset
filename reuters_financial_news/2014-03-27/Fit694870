March 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

A move by Dutch pension funds to enter the mortgage  market as direct lenders could boost credit availability and reduce the  relevance of the Nationale Hypotheek Instelling (NHI) scheme, Fitch Ratings  says. Although the initial investment is limited in size, it suggests that  pension funds are attracted by investing directly in mortgages that will offer  returns of 4%-5%, rather than the lower yields NHI bonds would offer due to  their double guarantee. We regard initiatives to unlock additional funding  sources as positive for the Dutch mortgage market.  Press reports indicate that pension funds are among the institutional investors  that have agreed to commit EUR800m to an origination platform announced last  week by Dynamic Credit Partners, an asset manager, and mortgage originator and  servicer Quion. The money will be invested directly in mortgage loans via  Quion's broker network.  The pension funds expressed particular interest in non-Nationale Hypotheek  Guarantee (NHG) loans that provide higher margins, but have had virtually  identical origination standards to NHG loans since August 2011. This is  reflected in the converging payment performance between NHG and non-NHG loans  for more recent vintages in our performance monitoring, although recovery rates  remain higher on NHG loans. The preference for non-NHG loans would be consistent  with the Dutch government's aim of gradually reducing the proportion of NHG  loans in the mortgage market back towards their typical pre-crisis level of  around  a third of total originations. The Dutch government plans to finalise details of its NHI scheme this year after  several years of negotiations. The NHI would fund residential mortgage lending  by issuing government-guaranteed bonds backed by NHG loans and sold to pension  funds. This would support the housing market and provide an additional source of  funding to banks.  Dutch life insurers have been increasing their exposure to mortgages because of  their need to outperform the discount rate on their liabilities. The Dutch  central bank said last week that the residential mortgage loan portfolio of  Dutch life insurers rose by EUR4bn to EUR41bn, or 11.5% of total assets, in  4Q13. Adding indirect investments, including securitised debt, the figure is  EUR44bn.   Greater involvement by institutional investors, combined with the recent  agreement made between existing lenders and the Dutch supervisor to grant more  loans outside the lenders' Code of Conduct (which sets a maximum loan to market  value for collateral, for example), supports our prediction that Dutch mortgage  lending will increase by around 10% in 2014, and possibly by more next year. A  sustained increase would support our view that Dutch house prices are nearing  the bottom of the cycle.
