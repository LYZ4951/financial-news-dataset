Under federal rules, survivors are supposed to be offered the option to settle the loan for a percentage of the full amount. Instead, reverse mortgage companies are increasingly threatening to foreclose unless heirs pay the mortgages in full. (http://r.reuters.com/pub97v)  * Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> is paying $6.3 billion to settle a lawsuit arising out of troubled mortgage-backed securities it sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the run up to the financial crisis. As part of the settlement, Bank of America will also repurchase mortgage securities from Fannie and Freddie that are valued at about $3.2 billion.

(http://r.reuters.com/vub97v)  * Yet another proposal to overhaul United States' housing finance system will be put before Congress on Thursday. The major distinction of this proposal is that it would make the mortgage lending system more like a public utility, by creating a co-op of lenders that would be the sole issuer of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the government. (http://r.reuters.com/wub97v)  * Two Democratic senators on Wednesday criticized Target Corp's <TGT.N> management for not stopping a huge data breach of its systems, citing several missed opportunities to thwart the attack and protect customer data.
