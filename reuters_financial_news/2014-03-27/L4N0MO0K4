BANGKOK, March 27 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets remained rangebound amid weakness in Asian and U.S. stocks while the Philippine benchmark dropped to a one-month low after a wider January budget deficit and ahead of the Philippine central bank's meeting on interest rate policy.

Selling in interest rate-sensitive banking stocks such as BDO Unibank <BDO.PS> and Metropolitan Bank & Trust <MBT.PS>, with traders staying defensive due to the rate outlook, sent the key Philippine index <.PSI> down 0.5 percent to 6,318.34. The central bank is expected to keep its policy rate steady at a record low of 3.5 percent on Thursday, but hawkish comments from the governor reinforced views interest rates may be raised as early as in the second quarter.

"We expect Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), which has kept its overnight borrowing rate unchanged at 3.5 percent for the eleventh straight meeting since September 2012, to begin normalising its monetary policy by raising policy interest rates," they wrote in a report dated March 24. Sentiment in the region was broadly subdued, with stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI>, Thailand <.SETI>, Indonesia <.JKSE> trading cautiously higher while Malaysia <.KLSE> and Vietnam <.VNI> hovered in negative territory.

In Bangkok, the SET index traded a tad higher while cautions remained over the domestic political situation.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> eased 0.1 percent. U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as geopolitical concerns rose after the United States and the European Union agreed to work together on tougher sanctions on Russia. [.N]
