NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Perhaps it was inevitable that the market would see an IPO fall flat on its face, like King Digital <KING.N>. It plunged 15 percent in the second-worst inaugural day for an IPO since Twitter <TWTR.N> in November (Chegg <CHGG.N> fell 22 percent, so it was worse).

It's not as if a few people didn't flag this, but some of it may be the result of recent trends when it comes to marginal buyers in the equity market, which saw the biotech and tech stocks again get hit after an early surge on something or other (Crimea? Are we still flogging that horse?). Net exposure among the hedge fund crowd in the internet and cloud names has nose-dived in recent weeks, according to Credit Suisse's research. Whereas it once sat at more than 120 percent a ways back - around one year ago - and was still around 80 percent in the latter part of the year, that exposure is now at its lowest since the summer of 2012, and with the recent underperformance in this area, that may not abate.  Momentum stocks are funny things. They work until they stop working, and the days and days of increased volume and very little of what's called "backing and filling" (where the stocks pause, forcing bulls to defend their thesis by continuing to buy) suddenly gives way, leaving you doing the Wile E. Coyote impression after he's run off the mountain. The move away from Internet names is a smaller part of the overall shift in hedge fund exposure, a bit in the way of the more defensive names like telecom and utilities. The latter represent an opportunity now that Janet Yellen has suggested investors get a bit more defensive in their approach. (Well, she didn't suggest it outright, but the idea of interest-rate increases earlier than expected makes fixed-income portfolio values drop, so high-yielders like utilities just look better.)  For what it's worth, Twitter closed below its $44.90 first-day closing price for the first time since the early weeks of trading in that stock, so there's that.GDP GROWTH The last read on GDP comes through in the morning, with analysts expecting the U.S. economy to have grown 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.  A surprise upside on this one could add to concerns some investors have had about coming interest rate increases, but there are signals that suggest the Fed isn't ready for such a move and the markets aren't, either. The two-year note's yield of 45 basis points is still nowhere near the usual 1-percentage-point difference that generally precedes rate increases, even with a recent backup in rates.  It's unclear what the Fed is thinking now. Janet Yellen's "six months" comment prompted some to believe things were happening sooner than expected. However, subsequent remarks from other Fed governors (whether they're a way of papering over her too-specific statement or not) suggest this was all part of a grand plan, or some such.  If so, markets will keep reacting through pushing rates higher. In the interim, there are still surprises to be had, as seen in the five-year note auction, where a bunch of strong bidders came through, surprising those with big short positions who had been arrayed in favor of more weakness in prices.
