BRASILIA, March 27 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank sharply raised its forecast for inflation in 2014 and sees the economy growing at a moderate pace, signaling it may prolong its rate-hiking cycle to battle naggingly high inflation in an electoral year.

The central bank hiked its 2014 inflation forecast to 6.1 percent from a previous estimate of 5.6 percent as a severe drought in southern Brazil hits crops and pushes up food prices.
