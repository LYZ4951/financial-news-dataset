KYRRE AAMDAL, ECONOMIST, DNB "The rate path is lifted by roughly 5 to six basis points in 2015, and it is also a bit higher in the beginning of 2016. But in the end of 2016 the rate is a bit lower than the last time" "This was very much in line with our expectations. Probably slightly more bullish, but not that much that it affects our expectations for what the central bank will do in the future." "We expect the central bank to raise rates in September 2015"
