BRASILIA, March 27 (Reuters) - Brazil's Treasury mandated banks for the issuance of seven-year euro bonds in European and American markets, according to a government statement on Thursday.

The potential bond sale comes days after ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Brazil's sovereign debt rating to "BBB-", one notch above junk status. The government has 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) outstanding in euro debt securities maturing in Feb. 2015. The country first issued them in Feb 2005, with a re-tapping taking place a year later.
