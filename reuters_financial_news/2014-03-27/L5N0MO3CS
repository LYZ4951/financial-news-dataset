LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Embattled utility Energy Future Holdings [TXEFHE.UL] is lining up around $9 billion of bankruptcy loans before an imminent bankruptcy filing, sources involved in the matter said on Thursday.

The $9 billion Debtor-In-Possession (DIP) loan is in the final stages of negotiation, the sources said. Credit agreements have yet to be signed, but the deal is expected to be the largest-ever privately funded bankruptcy financing, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.
