March 27 (Reuters) - China's CITIC Pacific Ltd <0267.HK> plans to sell about $4 billion of shares to restore its public float after absorbing assets from state-owned parent CITIC Group Corp [CITIC.UL], Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

CITIC Pacific may approach sovereign wealth funds like China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] about buying stock in the offering, Bloomberg said.
