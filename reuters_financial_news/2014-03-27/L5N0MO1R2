LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Ukraine's dollar debt rose to multi-week highs on Thursday after the IMF said it agreed a $14-18 billion stand-by agreement with Ukraine.

The deal will unlock further credits to reach a total of $27 billion over the next two years. "The $14-18 billion number is positive and that will unlock further support from the European Union. We had estimated Ukraine needed $20-25 billion in support and this will cover it," said William Jackson, economist at Capital Economics. Ukraine's 2023 dollar bond <XS091760584=TE> rose more than 2 points to 90.353, its highest in almost 2 months, according to Tradeweb.
