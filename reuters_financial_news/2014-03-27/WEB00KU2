VIENNA, March 27 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> swung to a fourth-quarter net profit of 146 million euros ($201 million), the Austrian lender said, beating market estimates as net interest income and risk provisions came in better than expected.

Central and eastern Europe's second-biggest lender said it aimed to boost lending slightly in 2014 while its net provisioning should remain steady, although results may be affected by an ECB-led review of big banks' balance sheets.
