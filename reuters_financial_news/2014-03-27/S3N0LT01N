STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Reuters) - Swedish monetary policy should remain focused on meeting the country's inflation target, although interest rates can be used for short periods to dampen credit growth, Swedish central bank deputy governor Martin Floden said on Thursday.

"I think that monetary policy, temporarily, can be used to work against a broad credit expansion," Floden said in a presentation. "But we can't lose our focus on the inflation target for a long period and we can't deviate from the target for a period of many years." The central bank put aside concerns about levels of household debt - among the highest in Europe - and cut rates in December. Inflation has stayed low, but concerns about household debt levels also remain. Floden also said it would be a positive step if households were to fix their mortgage interest rates over longer period. Most Swedish households use floating rates for their mortgages.
