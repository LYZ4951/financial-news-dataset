OSLO, March 27 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank kept interest rates on hold at 1.5 percent on Thursday, as expected, and said its next move was likely to be a rate increase in the summer of 2015.

The bank has kept rates steady for the past two years. Earlier, it delayed a hike by a year, until the summer of 2015, to give the economy more time to recover from its rough patch.
