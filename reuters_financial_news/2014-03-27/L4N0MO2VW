March 27 (Reuters) - La Quinta Holdings Inc, a hotel chain backed by Blackstone Group LP <BX.N>, said it expects to sell 37.2 million shares in its initial public offering at between $18 and $21 per share.

Irving, Texas-based La Quinta will have an equity valuation of $2.57 billion at the top of the expected price range. The company had filed a $100 million placeholder with U.S. regulators in its initial IPO filing in February. [ID:nL3N0LF4PM] With more than 830 hotels, La Quinta is one of the largest owners and operators of budget hotels in the United States. Blackstone will hold a stake of about 64 percent in the hotel chain after the IPO if the underwriters fully exercise their option to buy additional shares, according to Thursday's filing.
