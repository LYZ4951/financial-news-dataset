March 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Revaluing properties securing loans serving as  collateral for Spanish mortgage covered bonds (cedulas hipotecarias or CH) would  boost transparency in cover pool analysis, which would be positive for  investors, Fitch Ratings says. If property revaluations were mandatory for all  mortgage loans, we estimate that Spanish banks would have to amortise between  EUR30bn-EUR40bn of CH, equivalent to approximately 10% of the total amount  outstanding. Given the distress in the Spanish property market, which has seen the Spanish  house price index fall by around 30% to 35% since the onset of the Spanish  crisis in 2008, mandatory property revaluations would push typical current  loan-to-value (CLTV) ratios up and therefore shrink the size of the eligible  cover pools (those with CLTV lower than 80% and 60% for residential and  commercial mortgages). In turn, smaller eligible cover pools would force CH  amortisation to comply with the minimum 25% overcollateralisation ratio  established by law.  At present, revaluations are voluntary, and most Spanish lenders do not update  property values once the mortgage is granted.  Our CH amortisation estimate is derived from Ministry of Development house price  data and assumes all property valuations Fitch receives are original valuations.  Evidence of the practical impact of revaluations comes from CaixaBank, S.A. <CABK.MC> and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA  <BBVA.MC> (BBVA)'s recent experience. These two banks  have conducted widespread property revaluations which triggered reductions of  their eligible cover pools of EUR20bn and EUR6.7bn respectively. In the same  quarter, CaixaBank amortised EUR13.5bn and BBVA amortised EUR5.4bn of CH,  approximately three-quarters of the amortisation was from retained CHs while the  rest was already scheduled.  However, because larger Spanish banks have tended to maximise CH issuance, the  impact on these two institutions may be greater than on smaller lenders, since  the amortisation requirement would reflect the size of any cushion above the  legal minimum, as well as the quality of the collateral and the timing of any  revaluation exercise.   While the agency's EUR30-40bn CH amortisation estimate is material for the  banking system, we think it is manageable as most Spanish banks have significant  volumes of retained CHs which could be unwound if needed. These retained CH were  issued but not placed with the market as a contingency plan in order to ensure  access to central bank liquidity if needed.
