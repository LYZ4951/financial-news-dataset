SEOUL, March 27 (Reuters) - Seoul shares inched higher on early Thursday, supported by a rise in market heavyweight Samsung Electronics while investors cautiously weighed the agreement between the United States and the European Union to cooperate on tougher economic sanctions against Russia.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> was up 0.2 percent at 1,967.51 points as of 0210 GMT.  "As in Wall Street, the sanctions on Russia are used as an excuse for investors taking a breather following yesterday's sharp rebound," said Chung Seung-jae, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities. The KOSPI rose 1.2 percent on Wednesday, notching its biggest one-day gain in more than a month. The U.S. and the EU on Wednesday agreed to work together to prepare possible tougher economic sanctions in response to Russia's behaviour in Ukraine. The geopolitical concerns brought down Wall Street, reversing earlier gains.
