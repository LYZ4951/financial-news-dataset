STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Reuters) - Total lending to Swedish households rose 5.1 percent year-on-year in February, the same level of expansion as in the preceeding month, the statistics office said on Thursday.

Swedish policymakers have expressed concern about household borrowing levels that, at around 170 percent of disposable income, are among the highest in Europe.
