NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup Inc <C.N> fell on Thursday after several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock's rating or target price, citing the Federal Reserve's rejection of its capital return plans a day earlier.

Citi shares slid 5.7 percent to $47.29 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had fallen as low as $47.11 earlier in the day. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) and Bernstein Research downgraded Citi shares to market perform from outperform. Analysts at KBW, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Securities cut their target prices to levels ranging from $52 to $60. On Wednesday, the Fed surprised investors and Citi executives by rejecting the bank's plan to buy back $6.4 billion worth of shares and raise its dividend, as part of its annual stress test of the largest U.S. banks. [ID:nL1N0MN184] "The Federal Reserve's surprise 'qualitative' rejection of Citigroup's capital plan raises questions about the company's relationship with its regulators and the necessary next steps and timing to restore confidence," said Bernstein's John McDonald in a note downgrading the stock. Although he considered Citi's shares to be cheap, McDonald didn't expect that they would perform well over the next six to 12 months without the ability to return more capital to shareholders.  Other analysts cited similar concerns. The Fed said its rejection of the buyback plan was based on Citi's inability to project revenue and losses across its global operations or to develop an adequate range of stress-test scenarios. Citi is considering resubmitting its plan. The outcome of the stress test was particularly important for Citigroup, which needed the Fed's permission to buy back shares to have a chance of meeting a key profitability goal set by Chief Executive Michael Corbat last year. To reach that goal of delivering at least a 10 percent return on tangible common equity by 2015, Citi would have needed to buy back more than $6 billion worth of stock, according to McDonald. Analysts said the Fed's rejection has left investors wondering how long it will take Citi to resolve issues that concern the Fed, whether Citi management believes it can still hit the return target next year and, if not, what Corbat's team will do about it.
