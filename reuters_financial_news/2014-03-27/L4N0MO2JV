MUMBAI, March 27 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose to record highs for a fourth straight session on Thursday, as state-run lenders including State Bank of India extended recent gains on broker upgrades and on hopes of some easing at the central bank's policy review on Tuesday.

Higher rollovers on an absolute basis coupled with high roll cost during the expiry of March derivative contracts also lent support and indicates market participants are bullish for the April series, dealers added.

Overseas investors have helped underpin gains, with net purchases in shares reaching $2.75 billion so far this month, according to regulatory data. "Profit-booking cannot be ruled out, but it remains a buy on dips due to flows and macro improvement," said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities. "Also, India's central bank may ease the rates a bit on April 1 in support of foreign investors."
