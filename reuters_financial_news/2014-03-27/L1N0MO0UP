SAO PAULO, March 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Brazil's state-controlled companies jumped on Thursday after a poll showed a decline in President Dilma Rousseff's approval rating as investors bet the stocks' outlook would brighten if Rousseff fails to win re-election.

Many investors have criticized the Rousseff administration for heavy-handed government intervention in the private sector and policies that run against the interests of minority shareholders in state-controlled firms.
