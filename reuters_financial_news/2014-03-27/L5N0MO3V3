LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Trafigura has appointed Duncan Letchford as the new chief executive of Galena Asset Management, the firm said on Thursday, after the previous head of its fund arm became chief executive of the parent this week.

Letchford was the chief financial officer of Galena, which manages over $2 billion invested in financial commodity contracts from offices in London, Singapore and Geneva.
