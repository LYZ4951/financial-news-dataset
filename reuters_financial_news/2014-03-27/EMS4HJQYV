NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper grew in the week ended Mar 26 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding rose $6.2 billion to $1.025 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $0.7 billion to $1.047 trillion.
