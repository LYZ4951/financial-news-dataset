March 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Deutsche Bank AG Taipei Branch's (DB Taipei) outstanding TWD1bn October 2019 senior unsecured notes at National Long-Term 'AAA(twn)'.   Key Rating Driver - Debt Rating The rating of DB Taipei's bonds is aligned with Deutsche Bank AG's <DBKGn.DE> Long-Term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', which is at the same level as Taiwan's  sovereign rating, equivalent to 'AAA(twn)' on the National Rating scale. This is  based on Fitch's rating criteria on senior bond instruments of financial  institutions.   Rating Sensitivities - Debt Rating The debt's National Rating will be downgraded if Deutsche Bank AG's Long-Term  IDR is downgraded to below Taiwan's sovereign rating of 'A+'.
