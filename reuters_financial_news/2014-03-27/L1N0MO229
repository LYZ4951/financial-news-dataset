NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based funds pulled $379 million out of stock funds in the week ended March 26, marking their first outflows in seven weeks, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

Investors pulled about $2.1 billion out of stock exchange-traded funds while pouring $1.7 billion into stock mutual funds. ETFs are thought to represent the institutional investor, while mutual funds are commonly purchased by retail investors.  European stock funds posted $355 million in outflows, marking their first outflows since last June, while emerging market stock funds attracted $279 million in inflows, marking their first inflows in five weeks.  Taxable bond funds attracted $2.9 billion in new cash, marking their third straight week of inflows, while high-yield bond funds posted $196 million in outflows, marking their first withdrawals in seven weeks.  Low-risk money market funds posted $3.4 billion in outflows, marking their fourth straight week of outflows.
