BANGKOK, March 27 (Reuters) - Stocks in the Philippines slid on Thursday as investors trimmed holdings in interest rate-sensitive stocks before the central bank's decision on interest rates, while shares in Indonesia retreated from a one-week high after late selling.

The Philippine main index <.PSI> finished down 0.5 percent at 6,315.69, the lowest since Feb. 25. Shares of Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co <MBT.PS> and Robinsons Land Corp <RLC.PS> were among underperformers. The Philippine central bank kept its overnight borrowing rate <PHP=PDSP> at a record low of 3.5 percent for the eleventh straight meeting, as expected. It raised banks' reserve requirement ratio 1 percentage point. [ID:nL4N0MN24T] The interest rate decision came after the stock market close. Indonesia's main index <.JKSE> closed down 0.1 percent amid selling in recent gainers. Bank Danamon Indonesia <BDMN.JK> shares dropped 3.6 percent after a rise early in the week and were among the top losers. Dividend-yielding stocks outperformed, led by a 2 percent gain in shares of Perusahaan Gas Negara <PGAS.JK> amid expectations of its strong dividend payouts. Thai shares <.SETI> snapped two days of gains, ending down 0.3 percent. Large caps which rallied early in the week on institutional-led buying mostly fell, including Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> and Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK>.
