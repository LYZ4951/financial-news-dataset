STOCKHOLM, March 27 (Reuters) - Further measures to strengthen financial stability in Sweden could lead Swedish central bank deputy governor Martin Floden to support easier monetary policy, he said on Thursday.

Sweden has tightened capital requirements for banks and introduced a number of other measures to make the banking system more robust and ease credit demand from households. The central bank and the government have said further action is needed and Floden said this could impact monetary policy. "It could have consequences that would mean that I think we should conduct a more expansive monetary policy," he told reporters on the sidelines of a presentation. However, he said he was "not at all sure that there is agreement on that within the Riksbank".
