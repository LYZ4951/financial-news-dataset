HONG KONG, March 27 (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Federal Reserve official said in Hong Kong on Thursday that raising the inflation target from 2 percent to 4 percent is not a good idea.

James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said the Fed's unconventional monetary policies are effective, even as he nodded to the possibility they may be sub-optimal and therefore contributing to unnecessary global volatility.
