OSLO, March 27 (Reuters) - Norway's central bank kept interest rates on hold at 1.5 percent on Thursday, as expected, and released fresh economic and interest rate forecasts.

The following is the text of the bank's rate decision.  "Norges Bank's Executive Board has decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged at 1.5 percent. "Developments in the Norwegian economy have been broadly in line with expectations. Against this background, the key policy rate remains unchanged. "The moderate economic upturn internationally is continuing. In Norway, growth has been approximately as projected in the December 2013 Monetary Policy Report, but growth prospects ahead have weakened somewhat. Growth in petroleum investment and housing investment is likely to be somewhat lower than projected earlier. The krone has been slightly weaker than assumed and wage growth was higher than expected in 2013. There are prospects that consumer price inflation will be slightly higher than previously projected. "The analyses imply an unchanged key policy rate in the period to summer 2015, followed by a gradual increase. The path for the key policy rate remains approximately unchanged from December. "The projections for the Norwegian economy show that growth will pick up somewhat further ahead. Capacity utilisation is expected to fall somewhat over the next year, but increase gradually thereafter towards a normal level. Inflation is projected to be somewhat lower, but close to, 2.5 percent in the years ahead.
