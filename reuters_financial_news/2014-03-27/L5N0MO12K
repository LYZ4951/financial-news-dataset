MOSCOW, March 27 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is ready to take special measures to support banking sector liquidity but sees no need to do so yet, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.

"We are ready to use all standard tools to provide liquidity to our banks," Nabiullina told an investment conference.
