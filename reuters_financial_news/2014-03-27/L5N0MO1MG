March 27 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's M3 money supply growth accelerated to 13.2 percent year-on-year at the end of February from 12.8 percent in the previous month, central bank data showed on Thursday.

Bank lending growth to the private sector decelerated marginally to 12.2 percent in February, the weakest clip since February 2012, from 12.3 percent in January. The central bank's net foreign assets dipped slightly in February to 2.688 trillion riyals ($716.7 billion) from a record high of 2.693 trillion riyals in January, but still up 10.4 percent from a year ago.
