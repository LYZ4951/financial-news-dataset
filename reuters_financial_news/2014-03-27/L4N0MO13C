SEOUL, March 27 (Reuters) - Seoul shares rose to their highest closing level in four weeks on Thursday, as foreigners picked up large-cap stocks such as Samsung Electronics as concerns about the strength of coming first-quarter earnings results eased.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.7 percent at 1,977.97 points, the highest close since Feb. 28. Foreign investors bought a net 242.3 billion won ($225.4 million) Korean won of KOSPI shares. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>, which accounts for one-sixth of total market capitalisation, advanced 3.7 percent. [ID:nL4N0MO0JB]
