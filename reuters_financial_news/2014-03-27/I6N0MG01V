MILAN, March 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Italian mid-sized lender Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> rose 11 percent on heavy volume on Thursday as investors bet on a turnaround under new management ahead of the release of 2013 results and of a new business plan.

Carige will publish late on Thursday its full-year results and approve an expected rights issue to shore up its weak balance sheet. The bank has a capital shortfall of at least 800 million euros ($1.10 billion), according to the Bank of Italy. Analysts say that potential fourth-quarter writedowns will be key to determine the size of its recapitalisation needs.  "The stock is rising ahead of the results and business plan," a Milan-based trader said. "Then there is the possibility that the foundation shareholder may sell part of its stake, but that's a different matter. The attention is on the plan right now." Investors have rewarded clean-up efforts at other Italian banks this year, including when writedowns have carved holes in their balance-sheets, forcing them to seek fresh capital. The biggest shareholder in Carige is considering selling a stake of up to 6 percent on the market to pay back debts, two sources close to the situation said on Wednesday. [nL5N0MN2YQ]
