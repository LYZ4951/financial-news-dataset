BEIJING, March 27 (Reuters) - China plans to set up a unified property database in four years, land minister Jiang Daming said in remarks published on Thursday, offering a concrete timeframe after repeated delays.

China's plan for a nationwide property database, once hailed as an antidote to corruption, has stalled amid resistance from local governments that illustrates the difficulty Beijing faces in driving through reforms to tackle widespread graft. The database is not only seen as vital for authorities to control a frothy housing market - it would also force corrupt local officials to come clean about properties purchased from ill-gotten gains, industry experts say.

The property registration will provide some support for fiscal and financial reforms, Jiang was quoted as telling the fist inter-ministerial meeting on property registration. The property registration will help "protect the legitimate rights of people and maintain good order in the real estate market transactions", the report said.
