NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Aircraft lessor Avolon is preparing for an initial public offering this year, two people familiar with the matter said, in a bet that yield-hungry investors eyeing growing demand for air travel would sustain a recent boom in aircraft finance.

Avolon, which is backed by private equity firms Cinven Ltd, CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Oak Hill Capital Partners, as well as Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, has been interviewing investment banks in the last few weeks to hire underwriters for an IPO, the sources said on Thursday. CVC and Cinven declined to comment. Representatives of Avolon and its other investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public.  Avolon's listing plans come as aviation draws interest from longer-term investors such as insurers and pension funds, who hope to boost weak returns dictated by low interest rates.
