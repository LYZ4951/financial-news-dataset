March 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

As outlined in a special report published today,  Fitch Ratings is now considering introducing a rating differential between the  bank holding company (BHC) and bank operating companies (opcos) in the U.S. due  to structural changes in the sector and evolving regulatory landscape.  Under its current criteria, Fitch equalizes U.S. BHC and opco ratings. This  reflects the close correlation between BHC and subsidiary default probabilities.  Regulation continues to evolve, but the Dodd-Frank Act's Orderly Liquidation  Authority (OLA) provides a framework for the resolution of large, systemically  important banks. It enforces BHC structural subordination through the ability to  bail in BHC capital in favor of its subsidiaries under a 'Single Point of Entry'  (SPOE) approach to resolution.  Continued regulatory progress would be consistent with greater-than-historical  differentials in BHC/opco relative credit risk profiles, which may ultimately be  reflected in rating changes.  Fitch is considering the following three options for changing the application of  its current criteria for U.S. banks in light of regulatory change and policy  maker intentions, which are discussed in more detail in the report:  --Downgrade BHC ratings --Upgrade bank opco ratings --Maintain status quo  How Fitch ultimately reflects the evolving regulatory changes in potential  rating changes is not reflective of the agency's fundamental view of the U.S.  bank sector. Fitch's U.S. bank rating outlook remains stable. Credit  fundamentals for U.S. banks are relatively strong with solid capital, liquidity  and asset quality positions. While earnings challenges persist, Fitch believes  the U.S. bank sector is well positioned for 2014. In conjunction with the publication of this report, Fitch invites feedback from  market participants. As noted, this is not a change of criteria. But as it does  reflect a potential change in a key assumption, Fitch is seeking comment.  Comments should be sent to FIcriteria@fitchratings.com by May 15, 2014.
