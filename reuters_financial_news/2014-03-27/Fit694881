March 27 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned 'Strong' Fund Quality Ratings to the following three funds managed by State Street Global Advisors (SSgA, NR): SSgA Fundamental Equity Europe Spotlight Fund SSgA Fundamental Equity Eurozone Spotlight Fund SSgA Fundamental Equity Global Spotlight Fund The 'Strong' rating reflects the disciplined investment process, the rigorous  fundamental research driving stock selections and the well-resourced investment  team, consistent across all three funds.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fund Profiles The funds are sub-funds of the State Street Global Advisors Luxembourg SICAV.  The global fund was launched in December 2012, the Europe fund in May 2013 and  the eurozone fund in August 2013. Assets under management in each fund were (as  of February 2014), respectively, EUR28m (Europe), EUR21m (eurozone) and EUR45m  (global).  Investment Process The investment process involves rigorous screening of the eligible investment  universe based on value and quality metrics to identify companies for further  research. Portfolio construction is equally rigorous based on an approximate  equal weighting and strong sell discipline relative to other stocks recommended  by the research team.  The proprietary stock research is of high quality, differentiated by its  consistency of approach, notably in its common set of accounting assumptions and  adjustments. Research outputs demonstrate a deep understanding of stocks covered  and key performance drivers.  Resources The investment team consists of 24 staff, based in Dublin. The research team of  19 analysts is highly experienced and benefits from a variety of complementary  backgrounds. The funds' portfolio managers, Lance Graham (Europe), William  Killeen (eurozone) and Brian Routledge (global), are highly experienced and  ultimately responsible for the fund's performance. SSgA's investment resources are extremely strong, including global trade  execution teams (11 traders in EMEA), an investment risk team of 16 and a  dedicated direct implementation (portfolio compliance monitoring) team based in  Dublin.  Track Record The funds, and comparable mandate reviewed by Fitch, have performed in-line with  the funds' stated investment style over a relatively short period in the case of  the funds which were launched in 2012-2013. The mandates however have a  considerably longer track-record, delivering particularly strong performance in  2012 compared both to peers, the funds' indices and to relevant value indices.  Fund Manager SSgA, a subsidiary of State Street Corporation <STT.N> (A+/Positive/F1+), is a global  asset manager with USD2.3trn in assets under management as of end-2013,  including EUR6.5bn in fundamental equities. The operational and IT environment  is built around standard third-party systems, providing well controlled and  efficient workflows.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the investment or operational  processes or resources dedicated to the fund. A material adverse deviation from  Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could result in a downgrade of the  rating. For example, this may be manifested in significant structural  deterioration in the fund's performance relative to its benchmark and peers, an  excessive risk deviation or style drift.   Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings combine Fitch's experience in qualitative fund  analysis with rankings and performance data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters  company. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings offer an independent, forward-looking  assessment of a fund's key performance and risk attributes and consistency of  longer-term returns, relative to peer group or benchmarks. The ratings focus on  the fund manager's investment process, key fund performance drivers, risk  management, and the quality of the fund's operational infrastructure.
