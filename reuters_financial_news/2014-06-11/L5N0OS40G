DUBAI, June 11 (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings <HSBA.L> has named Georges Elhedery as head of global banking and markets for the Middle East and North Africa region, effective immediately, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Elhedery had already been handling much of that remit since the previous banking and markets head, Mohammad al-Tuwaijri, was promoted to chief executive of MENA in July last year.
