LISBON, June 11 (Reuters) - The business empire of the Espirito Santo family, Portugal's only banking dynasty, has been in the limelight after the discovery of financial irregularities at one of its holding companies. [ID:nL6N0OF4MY]

This cast a shadow over plans by its banking arm, Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> to raise new capital. But BES was able to complete this successfully, raising 1.045 billion euros ($1.42 billion) in a share sale that attracted strong investor demand. [ID:L5N0OS2ON] Details of the family's history and key holdings are as follows:  * The family's banking origins date back to 1869, when 19-year old Jose Maria do Espirito Santo e Silva opened a money-changing business in Lisbon, possibly with inherited starting capital from family.  The business flourished by reselling Spanish lottery tickets in Portugal and Brazil. It then began providing loans and by 1916 was known as the Banking House Espirito Santo Silva & Co, with offshoots in Portuguese colonies Angola, Brazil and Mozambique. * During the dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, banker Ricardo Espirito Santo expanded the family's wealth by leading Portugal's tungsten trade with Germany before and during the second world war. * The family lost control of their Portuguese banking operations when the entire industry was nationalised in 1975 after the leftist Carnation revolution. The Espirito Santos' well-recognised name and international connections allowed the family to rebuild some of their banking activities abroad - in Brazil, Switzerland, France and the United States. They used Luxembourg as a base to set up the Espirito Santo International Holding in 1976, which laid the foundation for the group's present Luxembourg-based structure.  * They returned to Portugal in 1986 by founding, jointly with France's Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> and a few Portuguese shareholders, Banco Internacional de Credito (BIC). At the same time, Espirito Santo Investment Company was established, with Switzerland's UBS <UBSN.VX> and Luxembourg's Kredietbank as shareholders. When the country's banks returned to the private sector, the family regained control of the original Banco Espirito Santo and insurance firm Tranquilidade, which had been majority-owned by the family since the 1930s. In 2005, BIC and BES merged. * There has been a longstanding dispute over who should head the bank between Ricardo Espirito Santo Silva Salgado, 70-year-old BES CEO whose term runs until 2015, and his cousin Jose Maria Espirito Santo Ricciardi, 60. Ricciardi is the chief executive of the Espirito Santo Investment Bank (BESI) and the son of Antonio Ricciardi, 95, the family patriarch who heads the Espirito Santo Group's Supreme Council. Ricciardi tried to replace Salgado via a confidence motion late last year, but Salgado endured.   * Despite moves to simplify the ownership structure, it remains complex and preserves a cascade of holding companies that dates back to the family's move overseas after the nationalisation of the banking sector in Portugal.
