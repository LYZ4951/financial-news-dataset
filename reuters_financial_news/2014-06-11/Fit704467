June 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

RadioShack's <RSH.N> weak first quarter results underscore the material challenges in its core business segments with few options left to stem the declines given a tightening liquidity situation, according to Fitch Ratings.  Sales for the first quarter fell 13% to $736.7 million, reflecting significant  pressure within its mobility platform, which was down 19%, and its retail  platform (consumer electronics and other items) which was down 9.4%. At the same  time, the gross margin was down 370 basis points due to the promotional nature  of the mobility market. These results were below Fitch's expectations.   EBITDA at negative $227 million for the 12 months ended May 3, 2014, was  materially lower than the negative $161 million in 2013 and positive $48 million  in 2012. In Fitch's view, EBITDA declines are expected to continue given weak  underlying mobility and consumer electronics markets.  RadioShack's liquidity is dwindling. Fitch expects negative free cash flow of  $200-$250 million over the balance of 2014, which, together with seasonal  inventory build-up of $100-$150 million, would substantially eat into the  company's total liquidity of $424 million as of May 13, 2014. This liquidity was  comprised of cash of $62 million and revolver availability of $362 million  (after $68 million in letters of credit) and was down from liquidity of $554  million at year-end 2013. Management indicated that it drew on its revolver to  fund operating losses post quarter-end and that $35 million was outstanding on  the revolver as of June 9, 2014. Fitch believes RadioShack does not have material sources of liquidity beyond its  revolver, as virtually all of its assets have been pledged to its credit  facilities. Fitch expects excess liquidity to be very tight as we approach peak  seasonal borrowings, which could prompt a restructuring before year end. Absent an agreement with its lenders, it appears that RadioShack will only be  able to close 200 stores in 2014, down from its earlier plan to close up to  1,100 stores. In Fitch's view, closing fewer stores will be a drag on  profitability and, more significantly, free cash flow, as it will not provide  the much-needed funds from inventory liquidation that RadioShack was  anticipating. Fitch downgraded the long-term issuer default rating for RadioShack Corp. to  'CC' from 'CCC' on May 15, reflecting the increasing likelihood that RadioShack  will need to restructure its debt within the next 12 months. A further downgrade  to 'C' would signify that Fitch believes a default at RadioShack is imminent.
