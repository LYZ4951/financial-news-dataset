HANOI, June 11 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged up 0.3 percent at the break on Wednesday, led by gains in small- and mid-cap shares as the market expected the central bank to soon reduce the deposit ceiling rate, an analyst said.

Major banks have cut their deposit rates early this week, boosting investors' expectation that the central bank could soon lower the cap on deposit rate for terms shorter than six months, said analyst Doan Thi Anh Nguyet of Saigon-Hanoi Securities. The ceiling is expected to be cut by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5 percent, she said. Lower deposit rates can make bank loans cheaper.  "This could boost the country's credit growth," Nguyet said. Hanoi-based Vietcombank <VCB.HM> was among the top gainers, advancing 1.05 percent, and brokerage firm Saigon Securities Incorp <SSI.HM> increased 2.87 percent.
