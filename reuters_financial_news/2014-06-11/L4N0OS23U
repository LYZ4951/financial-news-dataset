HANOI, June 11 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> posted the fourth consecutive rise on Wednesday, gaining 0.61 percent as money poured into banking and real estate shares late in the session.

Almost all bank shares advanced, led by Vietnam's biggest listed lender by market capitalisation Vietcombank <VCB.HM> which rose 1.75 percent. Real estate firm HAGL <HAG.HM> also advanced 1.24 percent. Trading picked up near the session's close after a slow and cautious trade in the morning, but the overall volume was moderate at 85 million shares, slightly above the five-day average value of 79 million, Reuters data showed. It is unlikely that the index would gain strongly in coming sessions, as cautious investors could take profits soon, analysts said.
