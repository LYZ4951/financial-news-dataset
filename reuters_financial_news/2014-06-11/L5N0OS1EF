EDINBURGH, June 11 (Reuters) - European stocks opened steady on Wednesday, consolidating after a three-week rally led several indexes back to multi-year highs, leaving indexes at risk of a pullback in the short term.

Supporting the market was the retail sector <.SXRP>, which gained 0.5 percent, the top sectoral riser, after results from Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz <HMb.ST> and Spanish rival Inditex <ITX.MC> beat expectations. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was flat at 1,398.16, having gained 0.3 percent on Tuesday. The gains in Europe saw the FTSEurofirst 300 and the Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> hit their highest since January 2008 and September 2008 respectively, while the German DAX <.GDAXI> hit an all-time high. However, all three indexes entered "overbought" territory. The relative strength index (RSI), a widely used momentum indicator, rose above 70 on all three indexes, which is considered "overbought" and could signal a pause in the rally or a pull-back in the short term. Taking the most points off of the index was Vodafone <VOD.L>, down 3.1 percent after it traded without entitlement to its latest dividend payout.
