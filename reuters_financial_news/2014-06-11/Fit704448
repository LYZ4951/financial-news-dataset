June 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Man Group's <EMG.L> deal to acquire Pine Grove is part of a selective acquisition strategy that may boost the firm's diversification and scale, Fitch Ratings says. Business diversification could mitigate the risk of outflows driven by market volatility and investors' allocation shifts, while economies of scale remain important for tackling margin pressure in a fragmented  and competitive market. Pine Grove, a US-based credit-focused fund of hedge funds manager, will add to  Man Group's product offering and US presence, although, with around USD1bn of  assets under management (AUM), it is small. The deal is consistent with the  group's strategy to strengthen its multi-manager business, which was bolstered  by the acquisition of FRM in 2012. It will provide investors with greater  investment resources, attracting more assets. Terms for the deal have not been  disclosed but we believe it is being financed with Man Group's surplus capital,  which was USD550m at end-2013, adjusted for the final dividend and share  repurchase.  Man Group also said last month that it was in talks to buy Numeric Investors, a  larger, also US-based group with about USD14bn AUM focused on quantitative  investment strategies. The talks may or may not lead to a transaction. Such a  deal would have greater impact on the group's diversification because it would  boost AUM by 25%, reduce the group's reliance on revenues generated from its  managed futures fund AHL and bolster its US assets. But it is unlikely to be a  structural shift for the business and so would probably be neutral for Man  Strategic Holdings' 'BBB' rating. The rating reflects the group's smaller  absolute AUM and moderate product concentration compared with larger investment  managers. European asset managers are rationalising, innovating and diversifying in  response to margin pressure and changing market conditions. We believe small  selective deals - typically financed internally - will remain an efficient way  to quickly expand product lines and add distribution capacity in response to  changing investor demand for many asset managers.
