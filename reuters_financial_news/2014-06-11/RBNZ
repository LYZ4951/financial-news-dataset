WELLINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent on Thursday, as expected, and signalled it would continue to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation pressures in check in a buoyant economy.

Sixteen out of 17 economists polled by Reuters had expected the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to raise rates for the third time in as many reviews, after the central bank began its monetary tightening cycle in March.

New Zealand's official cash rate of 3.25 percent compares with 0-0.25 percent in the United States, 0-0.1 percent in Japan, 0.15 percent in the euro zone, and 2.5 percent in Australia. [ID:nL6N0KH306]
