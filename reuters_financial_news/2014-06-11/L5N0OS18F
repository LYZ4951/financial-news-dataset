WARSAW, June 11 (Reuters) - Poland-based PZU <PZU.WA>, Eastern Europe's biggest insurer, wants to invest up to 200 million zlotys ($66 million) over the next two to three years to build a network of up to 550 medical centres, a PZU manager was quoted as saying in a newspaper report on Wednesday.

The state-controlled firm plans to strengthen its product offer by also providing healthcare services and is tipped as a potential buyer of medical units owned by other state-owned companies. Last month, PZU bought a medical business from oil company PKN Orlen <PKN.WA> for 48 million zlotys and is now expected to bid for similar businesses owned by utility Tauron <TPE.WA> and copper miner KGHM <KGH.WA>. "We are holding talks with several companies," PZU manager Rafal Grodzicki told the Puls Biznesu newspaper. "Probably we'll buy one or two medical centres this year."
