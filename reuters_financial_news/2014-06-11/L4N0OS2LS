MUMBAI, June 11 (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped a four-day winning streak after hitting all-time highs for the fourth session on Wednesday as investors booked profits in recent outperformers such as infrastructure and capital goods stocks.

Mixed cues from regional markets also weighed on sentiment, while gains in some of the underperformers such as Infosys Ltd <INFY.NS> capped the losses. However, overseas investors, who were supporting the 21 percent gain in the NSE index so far this year, continued to buy shares worth $115.20 million on Tuesday, provisional exchange data showed. "There was some profit-booking and it was expected. In the near-term, I think the market would trade range-bound with a positive bias," said Suresh Parmar, head of institutional equities at KJMC Capital Markets. "There could be stock-specific movements like that we saw in Infosys today. However, the undercurrent is still firm," he added. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> ended 0.43 percent lower at 25,473.89.
