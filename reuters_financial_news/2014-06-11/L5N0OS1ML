DUBAI, June 11 (Reuters) - Albaraka Turk <ALBRK.IS>, a major unit of Bahrain-based Al Baraka Banking Group <BARKA.BH>, will start fixed income investor meetings in Asia, Europe and the Middle East on Friday, a document distributed by lead arrangers said.

The meeting may lead to a Reg S, U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured sukuk offer. In early May, a company official said the issue was expected to be up to $500 million of five-year sukuk.
