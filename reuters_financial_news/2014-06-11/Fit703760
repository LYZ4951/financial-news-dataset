June 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that the South African mutual fund industry has experienced substantial growth, dominated by inflows to multi-asset funds as investors seek higher yielding products. The share of multi-asset funds is now just under half of the South African mutual fund industry, compared with 25% at end-2010. The sector accounted for over 75%  of domestic mutual fund net inflows over a three-year period to 1Q14. The South African asset management industry is more concentrated than the  European industry. Over a three-year period to 1Q14, the top five European asset  management firms (by assets) received around a third of total industry inflows  into bond and multi-asset funds and 50% into equity funds. By contrast, over the  same period, the top five mutual fund managers in South Africa accounted for  about 60% of the total industry inflows.  Fitch estimates that the top five managers in Europe accounted for around 15% of  total European-domiciled mutual fund assets at end-March 2014, compared with the  top five managers accounting for around 60% of South African assets. The South African asset management industry had ZAR1.4trn of assets under  management at end-March 2014, according to the Association for Savings and  Investment South Africa. This represents a 54% increase over a three-year  period. The industry has grown quarter on quarter for 20 straight quarters.  Post the increase in the South African repurchase rate in late January 2014,  fixed income funds showed resilience by not only avoiding outflows but  registering inflows of around ZAR400m, according to Lipper data, while money  market funds continued to see outflows. The global trend of corporate treasurers  selectively reallocating some cash from money market funds to slightly longer  duration fixed income products is also visible in South Africa against a  backdrop of negative real returns to cash.
