NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 pulling back from record levels, though strength in a number of large-cap tech names kept the Nasdaq near breakeven territory.

Wall Street has advanced but struggled for direction lately, with daily modest moves in either direction. The S&P 500's drop of 0.3 percent so far on Wednesday represented its biggest daily decline since May 20.  The stock market's upward trend is still deemed intact, but a lack of major trading catalysts could curb gains. The Dow ended at a fourth straight record high on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 closed lower after four days of record finishes.  Investors expressed caution after the surprising primary election defeat of Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House of Representatives, by an upstart candidate from the Tea Party movement.

"The defeat is part of the selloff, but we've also had a fair run that has taken us to new highs at a time when the fundamental picture is improving but still murky." The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX> rose 2.4 percent to 11.25 on Wednesday but remained well below its historical average of 20. In a sign of the market's low volatility, the 14-day Average True Range on the S&P 500 hit 10.09, the lowest since February 2013. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 88.55 points or 0.52 percent, to 16,857.37. The S&P 500 <.SPX> slipped 5.62 points or 0.29 percent, to 1,945.17. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 2.90 points or 0.07 percent, to 4,335.10  The Nasdaq got a boost from Micron Technology <MU.O>, which rose 5.5 percent to $31.14 a day after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $50 from $30. Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, up 1.4 percent at $337, also buoyed the Nasdaq. Amazon's gain came after Goldman Sachs reportedly added the e-commerce company's stock to its "conviction buy" list. H&R Block Inc <HRB.N> climbed 3.5 percent to $31.81 after reporting fourth-quarter results.   Orexigen Therapeutics Inc <OREX.O> shares plunged 16.8 percent to $5.67 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed a decision on the marketing application for its obesity drug by three months. [ID:nL4N0OS2R6] Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> has reached an impasse in negotiating a multibillion-dollar settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the bank's mortgage investments, according to The New York Times. The bank's stock dropped 1.7 percent to $15.65.
