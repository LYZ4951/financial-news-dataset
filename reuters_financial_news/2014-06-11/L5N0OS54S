June 11 (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest private hospital group by value Mediclinic International Ltd <MDCJ.J> is selling up to 41.3 million shares to raise money for acquisitions in Switzerland, it said on Monday.

Mediclinic, which already operates Switzerland's largest private hospital network, Hirslanden AG, said the deals form part of its strategy to bulk up in attractive markets with strong fundamentals.  The company said the it has also identified a number of acquisition targets in the United Arab Emirates, where it is also trying to build a bigger presence, and in West and East Africa.
