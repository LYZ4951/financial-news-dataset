TALLINN, June 11 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should explore the option of large-scale asset purchases and have such a tool ready to use if needed, ECB policymaker Ardo Hansson said on Wednesday.

The ECB cut interest rates to new record lows last week and introduced a package of measures to stimulate lending to companies in the euro zone, though ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that the central bank was not done yet.  The ECB's most powerful tool to avert a Japanese-style deflationary spiral of falling prices, slowing consumption and growth would be to print money to buy assets - so-called quantitative easing (QE).  "I think we should be exploring those options and actually have those options on the shelf for possible use," Hansson, governor of the Estonian central bank, told reporters on the sidelines of a news conference when asked about QE.
