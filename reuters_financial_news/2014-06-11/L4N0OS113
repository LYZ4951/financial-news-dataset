MUMBAI, June 11 (Reuters) - India's Bombay Stock Exchange's main equity index, the Sensex  <.BSESN>, is not updating due to a technical snag, several dealers told Reuters on Wednesday.

Due to a technical snag in the index calculation system in the first few minutes, index calculation did not take place, a BSE spokesman said. "The system has been restarted by technical team and is now working fine," he added.
