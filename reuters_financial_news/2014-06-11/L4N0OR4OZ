WELLINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank raised rates for a third consecutive review on Thursday, and said further rises would be needed to contain inflation in the booming economy, although a strong currency and data would dictate how far and how fast it tightens policy.

The official cash rate was raised by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent, as expected, with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand saying strong housing and building markets were boosting inflation pressures, and surging immigration was also stoking local demand. It marginally lowered its forecasts of wholesale interest rates, and also scaled back inflation and growth expectations, but gave little hint that it is set to pause its planned rate tightening. Sixteen of 17 economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise, in line with financial markets pricing <CSSY>.

"You can't rule that out because it depends on the data flow, but the bottom line is that the Reserve Bank has quite a lot of work to do in the next year or two. The economy is very strong, you're talking about 4.0 percent growth rather than 3.5 percent they had before. "The rates as they are aren't likely to be the final figures. So they have further to go."  MARKET REACTION- The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> rose to $0.8635 from $0.8560 before the rate decision. Interest rate futures <0#NBB:> fell slightly.  LINKS:BACKGROUND   - The RBNZ started raising its official cash rate in March after being on hold at a record low at 2.5 percent for three years. - The government said in its May 15 budget that it would limit new spending despite a planned return to surplus in the 2014/15 year so that it does not add pressure to rates. - Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in the year to March 31, slowing fractionally in the quarter because of the dampening effects of the high New Zealand dollar. - Recent data has shown solid growth in retail sales, house prices growth slowing, a lift in building consents, but business and consumer sentiment easing from multi-year highs, and little change in the jobless rate. The economy is seen growing at annual pace of close to 4 percent. [NZ-ECI] <ECONNZ>  - The RBNZ imposed limits on low deposit home loans last October and has said they have been partly responsible for a slowdown in the housing market. However, it has also said it will consider lifting or reducing them until towards the end of the year.- The trade-weighted New Zealand dollar <=NZD>, the RBNZ's preferred currency measure, hit a life-time high in mid-May. - NZ's key rate compares with Australia's 2.5 percent, 0-0.1 percent in Japan, 0.15 percent in the euro zone, and 0-0.25 percent in the United States. [ID:nGLOBAL] - The next RBNZ official cash rate review will be on July 24.
