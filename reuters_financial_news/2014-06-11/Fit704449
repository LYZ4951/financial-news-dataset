June 11 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The French government's proposal to reduce the number of French regional governments to 14 from 22 does not alter the near-term challenges facing the regions, which reflect constraints on both revenue and expenditure flexibility, Fitch Ratings says. Over the longer term, the proposal could result in savings and greater liquidity for the fewer, larger regions that  would result.  The amalgamation proposal is part of plans to save around EUR10bn over the next  three years by eliminating overlaps among local and regional governments (LRGs).  It would support the aim of giving the regions a bigger role in economic  development, innovation and training by transferring some responsibilities down  from the departments or central government.  However, the trend towards increasing the regions' responsibilities has not  been, so far, matched by an increase in budget revenue. The changes come at a  time of heightened financial pressure due to national efforts at fiscal  consolidation. State transfers to all LRGs will be cut by EUR1.5bn per year in  2014 and 2015. LRGs are required to contribute to further expenditure savings  worth EUR50bn planned by the national government by 2017.  The 22 French regions are already facing budgetary challenges following tax  reform, sluggish growth, and increasingly rigid spending commitments in recent  years. They have almost no tax leeway (there is only one direct regional tax),  while automatic increases in staff salaries, and commitments made in previous  years in areas such as high-speed rail have made it hard to contain operating  and capital expenditure. We expect the regions' aggregate current balance to  deteriorate in 2014-2015.  Another key measure to monitor is the Territorial Reform Act (or Act III), due  to be debated in parliament later this summer, which will update the regions'  budgetary framework. It may ease revenue constraints, by replacing state grants  with tax revenues such as an increased share of value-added tax (cotisation sur  la valeur ajoutee des entreprises, or CVAE)  or other tax revenue to the  regions, or by reducing the planned grant cuts. Without additional revenue,  borrowing will accelerate. However, the regions' debt level is still relatively  low, with a healthy payback ratio of around four years at end-2013. Stronger  equalisation mechanisms have given some support to the weaker regions, while  co-financed projects with central government can help fund capex. The French  regions should continue to benefit from the strengths of the subnationals  institutional framework, including strong supervision by the central government. Over time, reducing the number of regions could be credit positive in helping  the remaining larger regions achieve economies of scale and improved bargaining  power with suppliers. Bigger regions with larger borrowing programmes - more  comparable with Germany's Laender or Spain's autonomous communities - may also  be better placed to tap a wider range of funding sources, for example via the  commercial paper and bond markets and bank liquidity lines, and enjoy improved  access to European development funds.
