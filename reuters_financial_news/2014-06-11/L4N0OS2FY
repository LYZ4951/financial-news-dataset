June 11 (Reuters) - British IT outsourcing and consultancy services provider Quindell Plc <QPP.L> said it could not meet the requirements for a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The AIM-listed company's shares were down about 27 percent at 12.75 pence at 1009 GMT on Wednesday. The stock was the top percentage loser on the London Stock Exchange. The company said it could not meet a criteria which deems the applicant ineligible if its business has undergone "a significant change in its scale or operations" during the last three years.
