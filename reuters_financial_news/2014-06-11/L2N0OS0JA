NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wednesday, as investors struggled to find reasons to keep buying with indexes still hovering near record levels.

* Wall Street has struggled for direction lately, with daily moves in either direction being modest. The S&P on Tuesday moved within less than a 7-point range, typical of a recent tight trading pattern.  * Sounding a cautious note, the World Bank late Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecast to 2.8 percent from 3.2 percent due to the impact of the Ukraine crisis and a harsh U.S. winter. However, with those issues largely in the rear-view mirror, the World Bank was confident economic activity was shifting to a stronger footing. [ID:nW1N0NL022] * While the upward trend in equities is still considered intact, a lack of major trading events could limit gains after the market's recent rally. The Dow ended at a fourth straight record Tuesday, while the S&P 500 closed lower after four days of record finishes.  * Investors were keeping an eye on low levels of both trading volume and volatility. The lighter-than-average volume could make the market vulnerable to sharp fluctuations, while some view the low levels of the CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> - the so-called 'fear gauge' - as a sign the market is not fully taking into account issues that could derail the rally. * In a sign of the market's low volatility, the 14-day Average True Range on the S&P 500 hit 10.09, the lowest since February 2013.  * S&P 500 futures <SPc1> fell 8 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> lost 70 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> slid 15.5 points. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Morning Call: Apple, Starbucks embroiled in tax probe http://reut.rs/TnJmeL  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> * In company news, Micron Technology <MU.O> was one of the Nasdaq's most active premarket movers, rising 3.9 percent to $30.66 a day after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $50 from $30.   * Sources told Reuters that Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> later this year plans to launch a marketplace for local services, from babysitting to party clowns, beginning with a single market. Shares rose 1.1 percent to $336 in premarket trading. [ID:nL2N0OR1U4] * Orexigen Therapeutics Inc <OREX.O> plummeted 17 percent to $5.68 in heavy premarket trading after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed a decision on the marketing application for its obesity drug by three months. [ID:nL4N0OS2R6] * Bloomberg reported that IBM Corp <IBM.N> was nearing a deal to sell its chip-making business to contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc for an undisclosed amount. Shares of the Dow component dipped 0.4 percent to $183.54.
