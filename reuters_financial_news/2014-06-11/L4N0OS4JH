June 11 (Reuters) -    China Construction Bank (CCB) <601939.SS>, China's second-largest lender, has been selected to become the first clearing service for renminbi trading in London, the Financial Times reported, citing people close to the decision.

The clearing bank will help secure London's position as a global centre for foreign exchange trading, as financial capitals around the world race to secure a slice of the fast-growing offshore yuan <CNH=> trade. The paper said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was expected to announce the deal when he visits London next week for an annual summit, a reciprocal visit following a trip by Britain's prime minister to China last year.

The Treasury declined to comment. Britain and China signed an agreement last month to set the service up, days after Germany clinched a similar deal. China is a focus of the British government as it tries to boost the country's exports, including those from its powerful financial services industry.

Deposits in Taiwan, Singapore and Macau also dwarf those in Luxembourg, Paris or London. New York lags far behind Europe.
