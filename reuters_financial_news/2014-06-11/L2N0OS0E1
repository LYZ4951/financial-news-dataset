NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were lower on Wednesday, as investors struggled to find reasons to keep buying with indexes still hovering near record levels.

* Wall Street has been struggling for direction lately; the S&P on Tuesday moved within less than a 7-point range, typical of a recent tight trading pattern.  * While the upward trend in equities is still considered intact, a lack of major trading events could limit gains after the market's recent rally. The Dow ended at a fourth straight record Tuesday, while the S&P 500 closed lower after four days of record finishes.  * Investors were keeping an eye on low levels of both trading volume and volatility. The lighter-than-average volume could make the market vulnerable to sharp fluctuations, while some view the low levels of the CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> - the so-called 'fear gauge' - as a sign the market is not fully taking into account issues that could derail the rally. * In a sign of the market's low volatility, the 14-day Average True Range on the S&P 500 hit 10.09, the lowest since February 2013.  * S&P 500 futures <SPc1> fell 9.2 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> lost 62 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> slid 16.5 points. * In company news, Micron Technology <MU.O> was one of the Nasdaq's most active premarket movers, rising 2.3 percent to $30.20 a day after Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $50 from $30.  * Sources told Reuters that Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> later this year plans to launch a marketplace for local services, encompassing anything from babysitters to handymen to birthday clowns, beginning with a single market. Shares rose 0.5 percent to $334.02 in premarket trading. [ID:nL2N0OR1U4] * Patent risk management company RPX Corp <RPXC.O> is in advanced talks to acquire litigation data provider PatentFreedom, three sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. [ID:nL2N0OR22G] * Bloomberg reported that IBM Corp <IBM.N> is nearing a deal to sell its chip-making business to contract chipmaker Globalfoundries Inc for an undisclosed amount.
