MILAN, June 11 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest insurer Assicurazioni Generali <GASI.MI> closed on Wednesday the sale of 100 percent of its Fata Assicurazioni Danni unit to smaller rival Cattolica <CASS.MI> for 194.7 million euros ($265 million).

Generali said in a statement the sale would boost its Solvency I ratio by 0.7 percentage points. Generali and Cattolica agreed the sale of Fata, which focuses on agricultural business, in November last year for a price of 179 million euros. The slightly higher final price reflects rising values of portfolio assets, Cattolica said in a separate statement.
