SANTIAGO, June 11 (Reuters) - Chile's central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate <CLINTR=ECI> steady at 4.0 percent at its monetary policy meeting on Thursday, a majority of traders forecast in a central bank poll published on Wednesday.

Almost 80 percent of the 57 traders polled said they expected the bank would hold the rate, while over 60 percent saw a cut to 3.75 percent within three months.
