MILAN, June 11 (Reuters) - Insurer Generali <GASI.MI> kicked off the dismantling of a shareholder agreement in Telecom Italia's top investor Telco by exercising an option to leave the pact early.

Generali formed the Telco group in 2007 with Spanish telecom operator Telefonica <TEF.MC> and Italian banks Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and Mediobanca <MDBI.MI>.  Telco is Telecom Italia's biggest investor with a stake of about 22 percent and was, until a change in corporate governance practices this year, able to appoint a majority of board members.
