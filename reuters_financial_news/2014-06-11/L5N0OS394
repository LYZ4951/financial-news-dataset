LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - It is up to the market and not public authorities to take the leading role in reviving the asset-backed securities (ABS) market, Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said on Wednesday.

"Investors are interested in asset backed securities and there is a good reason why it's important to revitalise the asset backed securities market," Dombret told reporters during a visit to London.
