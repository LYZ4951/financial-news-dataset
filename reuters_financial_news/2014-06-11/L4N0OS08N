SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - Australian shares inched up on Wednesday, as gains for banking stocks slightly outweighed dips for mining and defensive sectors as Wall Street's flat finish limited leads.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> added 5.7 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,469.7 by 0225 GMT. The benchmark edged 0.1 percent higher on Monday.  A measure of Australian consumer sentiment steadied in June as the shock from May's unpopular federal budget began to fade and worries about family finances and the near-term economic outlook eased a little. [ID:nS9N0M300H] Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> added 0.3 percent, as did Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX>.  Shares in takeover target Aquila Resources Ltd <AQA.AX> rose 2.7 percent to A$3.61, their highest since May 2012, after a block trade of shares went through at a price 10 percent higher than Chinese state-owned Baosteel Resources has offered for the company. [ID:nL4N0OS0A9] Copper dropped to a one-month low on Tuesday as an investigation into metal financing in China prompted concern that a crackdown could hit trade in the metal.  BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX>  both lost 0.9 percent. Elsewhere, Lynas Corporation Ltd <LYC.AX> fell 3.5 percent  Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG, said metal prices were   moving sideways ahead of Australia May jobs data <ECONAU> due on Thursday. "The numbers will give a really good indication of how people have taken the budget," he said. "From the market's perspective, the budget is not as bad as some people are reporting - which is why people are holding out because everything is looking just slightly expensive." Among defensive stocks, consumer retail staple Woolworths Ltd <WOW.AX> lost 0.7 percent and Sonic Healthcare Ltd <SHL.AX> slipped 0.2 percent.  Downer EDI Ltd <DOW.AX> sank 10.4 percent to 2-1/2 month lows of A$4.74 after the company said its Goonyella Riverside mine contract has been terminated, with an impact on work-in-hand of approximately A$360 million. [ID:nWNBS00GSP] Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd <FLT.AX> jumped 1.9 percent after saying it is expected to achieve underlying profit before tax of A$370 million-A$380 million for the year to June 30. [ID:nWNBS00GSR] New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> slipped 0.1 percent or 7.1 points to 5,172.3, in quiet trade as investors remain cautious ahead of the central bank's rate decision on Thursday.
