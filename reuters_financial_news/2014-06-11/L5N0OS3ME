WARSAW, June 11 (Reuters) - Austria's largest insurance company Vienna Insurance Group <VIGR.VI> <VIGR.PR> may list on the Warsaw bourse if a proposed tie-up of the Warsaw and Vienna stock exchanges goes ahead, the insurer's CEO Peter Hagen said.

The insurer is also looking for further acquisitions in the region, including Ukraine and Poland, which it would finance without any capital increase, Hagen said in an interview on Wednesday. The Warsaw Stock Exchange <GPW.WA> has been in talks for around a year on a merger with the Vienna bourse, which also owns smaller exchanges in Prague, Budapest and Ljubljana. "It is a big administrative burden to be listed, and a cost of course. If these institutions could come together they could probably unify their regulations. So we could do a similar deal with Warsaw as we did with Prague," Hagen said. VIG, which has its main listing in Vienna but is also traded in Prague, has a market capitalisation of $6.97 billion, compared to a $13 billion value for Poland's biggest insurance company PZU <PZU.WA>. Hagen said the sort of firms VIG was targeting were smaller and the deals would be financed from its own pocket. He said VIG's interest was focused on Poland, in particular because of its big market that is still undeveloped compared to Western Europe peers. The company is also interested in Ukraine, he said, where insurance companies are for sale at low prices and the growth potential is "enormous". Poland is VIG's third-biggest market in terms of its contribution to the group's gross premium and net profit. Hagen said Poland will sooner or later overtake the Czech Republic, the second most important country, because of the scale of the Polish market.
