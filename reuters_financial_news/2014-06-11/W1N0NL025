WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit shrank more than six percent from a year earlier to $130 billion in May, according to data released by the Treasury Department on Wednesday.

Analysts polled by Reuters expected a $131 billion deficit last month. The gap was $139 billion in May 2013. May's results brought the year-to-date deficit to $436 billion, compared with $626 billion in the same period last year. Last month's budget results were affected by differences in the calendar. If adjusted for timing-related transactions, the U.S. would have ended the month of May with a deficit of $87 billion, down from last year's adjusted $106 billion deficit. Receipts totaled $200 billion, up 1 percent from a year ago, the monthly budget statement said, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.93 trillion. Outlays were at $330 billion, down 2 percent from last year, for a year-to-date total of $2.37 trillion.   A Treasury Department official said that it is typical for the government to run into the red in May because there are no significant tax due dates that month.
