BRUSSELS, June 11 (Reuters) - The European Union General Court said on Wednesday it had annulled an asset freeze imposed by the EU on Syria International Islamic Bank <SIIB.DS>.

The court said the EU had failed to prove that transactions carried out by the bank "involve a particularly high risk that the money comes from the Syrian regime."
