FRANKFURT, June 11 (Reuters) - Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> sold 5.1 billion euros ($6.94 billion) in commercial real estate and non-performing loan portfolios in Spain, Japan and Portugal, the bank said on Wednesday, in a move to shed risky assets from its balance sheet.

U.S. investment bank JPMorgan <JPM.N> and private equity house Lone Star formed a consortium to purchase Spanish commercial real estate (CRE) loans and non-performing loans in Portugal, Commerzbank said in a statement. A 700 million euro Japanese CRE portfolio was sold to Asia-focused alternative investment manager PAG, it added. The announcement of the deal, one of the biggest of its kind since Spain's 2008 real estate crash, confirms a Reuters report published in May. [ID:nL6N0O61U2]
