WELLINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy has strong momentum but there is much uncertainty about the future path which may affect interest rate policy, the central bank governor said on Thursday.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent as expected, saying it needed to keep tightening policy to contain inflation pressures in the strongly performing economy. [ID:nRBNZ] RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said policy was based on a plausible path but was highly conditional on economic data and the strength of the New Zealand dollar. "But there's a lot of uncertainty around those key variables," Wheeler told a news conference.
