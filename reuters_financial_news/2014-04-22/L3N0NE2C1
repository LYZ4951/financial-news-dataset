HANOI, April 22 (Reuters) - All stock markets in Southeast Asia enjoyed a profitable trade on Tuesday, with the Singapore bourse scaling a closing high of more than 10 months on gains in property stocks.

Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> rose 0.67 percent to close at 3,277.53, the highest since June 4 last year. Gains in real estate companies were buoyed by a recent offer of CapitaLand <CATL.SI> to buy out minority shareholders in its shopping mall unit CapitaMalls Asia Ltd <CMAL.SI>, analysts and traders said. [ID:nL3N0N61CU] "It had a positive impact... Property counters have been lagging behind the index for quite a long time now," said a Singapore-based trader with DBS. Real estate firm City Developments <CTDM.SI> jumped 4.36 percent and CapitaLand <CATL.SI> climbed 0.93 percent. The Philippine index <.PSI> marked its fourth straight day of gains amid positive sentiment as investors expected firms to report good corporate earnings, due between late April and early May, analysts said. It rose 0.26 percent to end at 6,784.95, the highest since July 25 last year. It has risen 15.2 percent this year, Reuters data showed, making it the region's best performer. Stocks in Indonesia <.JKSE>, Malaysia <.KLSE>, Thailand <.SETI> and Vietnam <.VNI> also climbed, with Vietnam rebounding from a low of 10 weeks to end up 2.1 percent on bargain-hunting, led by banks and property stocks.
