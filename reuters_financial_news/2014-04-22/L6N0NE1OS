DUBAI, April 22 (Reuters) - The government of Dubai plans to sell a benchmark-sized sukuk with a lifespan of 15 years on Tuesday, a document from lead managers said.

Initial price thoughts on the Islamic bond have been set between 5 and 5.125 percent, the document said. Benchmark size is traditionally understood to mean at least $500 million.
