MUMBAI, April 22 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended flat on Tuesday after hitting record highs for a second consecutive session as the momentum waned ahead of the expiry of monthly derivative contracts and on expectations that current levels sufficiently price in fundamentals.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> closed 0.03 percent lower at 22,758.37 after gaining as much as 0.39 percent to an all-time high of 22,853.03.
