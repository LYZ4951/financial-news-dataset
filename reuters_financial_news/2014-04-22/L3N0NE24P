NEW DELHI, April 22 (Reuters) - HDFC Bank Ltd <HDBK.NS>, India's third-biggest lender by assets, said its quarterly net profit grew at the slowest pace in a more than a decade, slightly lagging estimates, as a weaker economy led to a slowdown in lending.

The Mumbai-based bank said net profit rose 23 percent to 23.27 billion rupees ($384.79 million) for its fiscal fourth quarter to March from 18.9 billion rupees in the same year-ago period. Analysts had on average forecast a net profit of 23.91 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.
