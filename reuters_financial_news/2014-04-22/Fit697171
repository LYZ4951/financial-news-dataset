April 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects Italian non-life underwriting  results to deteriorate in 2014, with claims frequency increasing and premium  rates continuing to fall. Life sales are volatile, but should achieve  single-digit growth. Fitch believes that the eurozone debt crisis remains a threat to Italian life  insurers' creditworthiness despite the crisis having shown signs of tangible  improvement in 2012 and 2013. Italian life insurers are significantly exposed to  Italian government and corporate debt. Fitch currently rates Italy 'BBB+', with  a Negative Outlook. Fitch expects Italian insurers' non-life premium income to remain under pressure  in 2014 due to declining rates in the dominant motor market and stiff  competition in commercial lines. As a result, prospects for growth remain  subdued. Fitch expects life sales to continue to grow in 2014, albeit at a slower pace  than in 2013. Life profitability is much harder to predict, given the volatility  in the Italian bond market, as some of the fluctuation in the prices of bonds on  insurers' balance sheets feeds directly into their reported profit.
