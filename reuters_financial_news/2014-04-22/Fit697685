April 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based agricultural processing and trading company REI Agro Ltd's <REAG.NS> (REI) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+' and revised the Outlook to Stable from Positive. The agency also affirmed the company's senior unsecured rating at  'B+'. At the same time Fitch has withdrawn REI's ratings because the agency  believes the ratings are no longer relevant to its coverage. Fitch will no  longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for REI. The Outlook revision reflects Fitch's expectations that REI is unlikely to  maintain interest coverage (defined as EBITDA/gross interest expense) above the  2x threshold in the medium term. This is primarily because REI was unable to  issue a proposed US dollar bond in early 2013, it faces the impending payment of  most of its outstanding foreign currency debt in November 2014, and it had  weaker EBITDA margins because the sales mix shifted in favour of its trading  business.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Lower Profitability and Interest Cover: Fitch expects REI's interest coverage  ratio to remain below the 2x threshold over the medium term, and its EBITDA  margins to stabilise between 10%-12%, which is lower than the 15%-21% range in  the three financial years that ended March 31, 2013.  REI's current business  risk profile combined with its lower interest coverage is in line with a 'B+'  rating. Sales Mix to Stabilise: Sales from trading, which has lower profitability than  rice processing, accounted for nearly 60% of REI's revenue in FY13 compared with  54% in FY12. Fitch expects REI's sales mix to stabilise over the medium-term as  the company is likely to increase the utilisation of its spare manufacturing  capacity.  Market-Leading Position, Lower Price Volatility: REI's 'B+' rating is supported  by its market-leadership and integrated business model in India's basmati rice  industry. This in turn, is supported by REI's well-known brand and strong  distribution network within India. The company is also expanding in key export  markets in the Middle East and has established a distribution network via its  subsidiaries to support its branded rice sales.  Branded basmati rice has historically exhibited lower price volatility compared  with most other agricultural commodities. This is due to the limited supply of  basmati rice, the lengthy time needed for processing and maturing, as well as  strong demand stemming from a niche segment of rice consumers. Working Capital-Intensive Operations: REI's 'B+' rating also reflects its  working capital-intensive operations, which result in negative free cash flow  and high funds flow from operations (FFO) net leverage (FYE13: 3.7x). The  company's working capital intensity is driven by its need to hold processed  basmati rice in inventory for 18-24 months as part of the maturing process.  Fitch expects REI's free cash flow generation to turn positive from FY15 because  capex is likely to decline following a peak in FY12 and FY13.
