SEOUL, April 22 (Reuters) - Seoul shares edged higher on Tuesday, buoyed by gains on Wall Street, while the won <KRW=> slipped on broad dollar strength amid subdued trade as investors awaited market-moving catalysts.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> was up 0.1 percent at 2,001.35 points as of 0210 GMT. The South Korean won <KRW=KFTC> stood at 1,040.8 against the dollar, down 0.2 percent from Monday's local close at 1,039.0, poised to mark a second day of falls. Market players said the won's losses against the dollar, which returned from the Easter holidays at a two-week high against a basket of currencies, could be capped by local exporters. [USD/] "We're likely to see a narrowly boxed range for the won today. Exporters will probably start selling dollars once the won falls below the 1,040 level," said Hong Seok-chan, a foreign-exchange analyst at Daishin Economic Research Institute. Foreign investors bought a net 24.4 billion won ($23.5 million) worth of local stocks by midday in their sixth straight session of purchases. Trade was expected to be thin on Tuesday on a lack of major cues, with investors awaiting a preliminary survey on manufacturing activity in China the following day. Traders were also seen holding their fire ahead of first-quarter earnings reports from major companies this week. Declining stocks narrowly outnumbered advancers 396 to 367. Hyundai Securities <003450.KS> shares outperformed the market by far. They soared more than 8 percent in early trade on media reports that the brokerage may be acquired by Hyundai Motor Group. Lagging behind were LG Hausys Ltd <108670.KS> and Hite Jinro <000080.KS>, falling more than 2 percent. The KOSPI 200 benchmark of core stocks <.KS200> was up 0.1 percent, while the junior KOSDAQ <.KQ11> also edged 0.1 percent higher. June futures on three-year treasury bonds <KTBc1> ticked up 0.01 point to trade at 105.72.
