MADRID, April 22 (Reuters) - Mid-sized Spanish lender Bankinter <BKT.MC> is expected to report a 29 percent jump in first quarter net profit on Wednesday, according to the averaged forecasts of five analysts surveyed by Reuters.

Bankinter, the country's seventh biggest bank by market value, should be helped by falling deposit costs in line with peers. That will likely boost net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus funding costs, which analysts expected would grow 28 percent compared to the first quarter of 2013. Bankinter is also likely to put aside less money against souring debts, after taking big provisions in 2012 and 2013 to clean up its books after a property crisis. The bank was seen reporting a 65-million-euro ($90 million) net profit for the quarter, up from 50.4 million euros in the first three months of 2013.  Following are the results of the poll in simple averages and millions of euros:
