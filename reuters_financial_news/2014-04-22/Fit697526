April 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has said that a recent increase in investor concentration within the LGIM US Dollar Liquidity fund does not impact its 'AAAmmf' rating. The fund is managed by L&G Investment Management (LGIM) and is a sub-fund of the Irish-domiciled LGIM Liquidity Funds plc. In early April 2014, a single investor placed USD350m in the fund as part of a  formally-defined agreement with LGIM to retain this investment in the fund. This  investment increased the fund's size to USD480m and represented approximately  73% of the fund, a significant concentration. Since the initial investment,  single investor concentration has fallen below 55% of the fund, due to other  fund inflows. Fitch's rating criteria for money market funds consider the degree of  shareholder concentration, as large unexpected redemptions could constrain  liquidity. The fund's significant shareholder concentration is managed by LGIM  by means of existing controls and communications with the investor. Fitch  considers that these arrangements and the terms of the investment mean that the  additional risk is being appropriately managed. In addition, the fund maintains  high levels of liquidity, with 50% of assets maturing overnight (as of 11 April  2014; after the investment was made).
