PARIS, April 22 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Tuesday, adding to last week's rally, with AstraZeneca's <AZN.L> stock surging on merger and acquisition talk.

Shares in the UK drugmaker jumped 7.8 percent after Britain's Sunday Times reported that U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer <PFE.N> has approached its British rival to propose a 60 billion pound ($101 billion) takeover. [ID:nL6N0ND27Y] Swiss drugmaker Novartis <NOVN.VX> also gained ground, up 2.5 percent after unveiling plans to transform its business by exchanging certain assets with GlaxoSmithKline <GSK.L> and divesting its animal health business to Eli Lilly <LLY.N> in deals worth billions of dollars. GlaxoSmithKline's shares were up 4.2 percent. [ID:nL6N0NE0Z2]
