SEOUL, April 22 (Reuters) - Seoul shares rose slightly on Tuesday, rebounding after modest losses in the prior session, as foreign investors shrugged off declines in Chinese shares and extended their buying spree into South Korean firms.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.25 percent at 2,004.22 points. Foreigners were net buyers of local stocks for the sixth consecutive session.
