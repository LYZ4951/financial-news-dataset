NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street's top bond firms bought the most two-year government notes in 11 months at an auction on Tuesday, which was the first part of this week's $96 billion coupon-bearing federal debt supply, according to U.S. Treasury data.

Primary dealers, or the 22 Wall Street dealers that do business directly with the Federal Reserve, bought 57.68 percent of the $32 billion in two-year Treasuries issue offered. This was more than 37.53 percent they purchased in March and the biggest share they bought since May 2013. [ID:nZXN0D5K01] These bond firms which include the broker-dealer arms of JPMorgan & Chase <JPM.N>, Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Morgan Stanley <MS.N> stepped up their purchases as demand from other two categories of bidders fell. Foreign central banks and other indirect bidders bought 23.36 percent of latest two-year Treasuries supply, down 40.94 percent in March and their smallest share in four months. Investment funds and other direct bidders bought 18.95 percent of latest two-year Treasuries supply, down from 21.53 percent in March and their smallest share since last July.
