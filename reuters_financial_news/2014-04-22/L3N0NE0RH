HANOI, April 22 (Reuters) - Singapore and Philippine shares advanced on Tuesday, both hitting their highest in almost nine months, while the Indonesian market extended its falls after recent gains.

Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> climbed 0.41 percent to 3269.34, buoyed by gains in the property sector, while a rise in Wall Street stocks for a fifth day also supported sentiment. [ID:nL3N0NE0Z3]  Philippine shares extended their three-day winning streak, climbing 0.59 percent to an intraday high level since July 26, 2013, Reuters data showed.  The SE Composite Index <.PSI>, Southeast Asia's best performer so far this year, has been lifted by investors' high expectation of corporate earnings, which are scheduled to be announced in between late April and early May, analysts said. Real estate firm Alliance Global Group Inc <AGI.PS> led the gains, with shares advancing 2.55 percent. Stocks in Malaysia <.KLSE> edged up 0.07 percent and Vietnam <.VNI> bounced back on bargain hunting after recent losses. [ID:nL3N0NE0RB] But Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> lost 0.57 percent, trimming down last week's gain on bargain hunting. Thailand's SET Index <.SETI> retreated 0.1 percent after reaching near its 1420-point technical resistance level in early trade on Tuesday.
