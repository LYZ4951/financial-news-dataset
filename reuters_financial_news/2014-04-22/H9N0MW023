BEIJING, April 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares edged lower on Tuesday, dragged down by losses in China Resources Power <0836.HK> after Chinese authorities said they were probing the head of its parent group for corruption.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.1 percent at 22,730.68. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong ended down 0.5 percent. Weak earnings were the main drag on H-shares, with Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <2333.HK> shedding 6.3 percent after a steep decline in first-quarter earnings growth.  Air China Ltd <0753.HK> shares lost 6.4 percent as the company braced itself for a 55-65 percent decline in first-quarter profits. Shares in state-owned energy giant China Resources Power <0836.HK> tumbled 9.6 percent following an investigation into corruption, and shares in its subsidiaries were also down. Losses in these energy shares countered a rally in China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec) <0386.HK> which ended up 3.4 percent on reports of increased shale gas production.(Reporting by Natalie Thomas; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)  Keywords: MARKETS HONGKONG STOCKS/CLOSE
