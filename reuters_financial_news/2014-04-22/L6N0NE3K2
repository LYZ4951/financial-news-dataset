LONDON/FRANKFURT, April 22 (Reuters) - German roofing company Braas Monier Building Group, owned by U.S. private equity firm Apollo [APLTR.UL], is preparing a Frankfurt stock market listing for June or July this year, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The company is seeking to raise 500 million euros ($690 million), one of the sources said. BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> and UBS <UBSN.VX> would act as global co-ordinators, with Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, JP Morgan <JPM.N> and Berenberg as joint bookrunners, the sources said.  Apollo, York Capital Management and TowerBrook Capital Partners took over Braas Monier, which supplies roofing materials, in 2009 following a debt restructuring.  Earlier this month, the company finalised 565 million euros of loans due in 2020 as part of a refinancing. The company had sales of 1.3 billion euros in 2012.
