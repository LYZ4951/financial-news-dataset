April 22 (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value LP has got consent from 54 percent of Darden Restaurant Inc's <DRI.N> shareholders to hold a special meeting to vote on a proposal to delay the company from spinning off its Red Lobster chain, CNBC reported, citing sources.

Darden has 60 days to call a meeting to consider the non-binding shareholder proposal, according to CNBC's sources. "We have not received notice from Starboard," Darden said in an emailed statement. Starboard was not immediately available for comment.
