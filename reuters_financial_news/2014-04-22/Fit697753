April 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says the financial product to be  issued by Citic Securities <600030.SS> , backed by rental income from office buildings, is  more similar to asset-backed securities (ABS) than a real estate investment  trust (REIT). Various media reported recently that Citic Securities is ready to issue the  first REIT in China. Yet, there are a number of differences between the Citic  product and a typical REIT according to international standards. Firstly, the  Citic product will be traded privately while a REIT is traded publicly with good  liquidity. Secondly, the Citic product offers predetermined yields to investors  from two tranches, instead of delivering at least 90% of distributable income,  which is a feature commonly seen in REITs. Thirdly, the product has a finite  time horizon and may be subject to refinancing risk at maturity. The proposed CNY5.2bn product has two tranches. The CNY3.65bn tranche A yields  7%-9% and the CNY1.56bn tranche B offers a yield of 12%-42%, according to IFR  Asia. The two tranches are backed by rental payments from two Citic-owned office  buildings situated in prime business districts in Beijing and Shenzhen. The  product, which has a term of three to five years, is being offered to  institutional investors on a private basis and will not be traded publicly in  the secondary market.
