Monday's announcement that more companies received the greenlight to list came after the Securities regulator surprised investors with similar news over the weekend for 28 companies  to list after a two month hiatus, stoking concerns of a share oversupply and of funds being diverted from existing companies The 18 new approvals brings the total number of companies cleared for listing to 46. A further 560 companies are still waiting for IPO approvals. One bright spot on the index was Shanghai free trade zone related companies, which had a positive day after the Shanghai municipal government published new regulations aimed at facilitating commodities trading in the zone.
