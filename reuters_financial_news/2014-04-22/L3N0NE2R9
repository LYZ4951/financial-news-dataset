April 22 (Reuters) - U.S. property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc <TRV.N> reported a 17 percent rise in first-quarter profit, helped by higher premiums and net investment income.

The company's net income rose to $1.05 billion, or $2.95 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, from $896 million, or $2.33 per share, a year earlier. Net written premiums rose about 5 percent to $5.87 billion, while total revenue rose 6 percent to $6.71 billion. [ID:nBw96dXlYa]
