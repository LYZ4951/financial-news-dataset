LAGOS, April 22 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> firmed slightly against the U.S. currency on Tuesday, lifted by expectations of month-end dollar sales from some oil companies and offshore investors participating in local debt auctions.

The local unit closed at 162.15 naira against the greenback on the interbank market, firmer than Thursday's close of 162.30 naira. Nigeria's financial markets re-opened on Tuesday for trade after a two-day Easter bank holiday. "Some banks are taking position in the naira," one dealer said, adding that the local currency could trade between 161.90-162.20 naira this week on the expected dollar supply.
