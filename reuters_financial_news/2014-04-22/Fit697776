April 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has withdrawn Russia-based KIT Finance  Investment Bank's (KF) ratings following its merger with Absolut Bank (AB;  B/Stable; b) on 18 April 2014. As a result, KF ceased to exist as a legal  entity. Fitch will assess in detail the implications of the merger for AB's credit  profile in the coming months. AB's ratings take into account of contagion risks  from KF (see, 'Fitch Downgrades Absolut Bank to 'B' from 'BB+'; Off RWN; Outlook  Stable', dated 31 May 2013, on www.fitchratings.com), in large part due to the  latter's weaker profile and significant legacy problem and other non-core  assets. However, most of these assets were acquired, before the merger, by  entities associated with Russian non-state pension fund Blagosostoyanie (which  controls AB) to reduce contagion risks.   KF's ratings were as follows (all withdrawn) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR): 'B', Outlook Stable Short-term IDR: 'B' National Long-term Rating: 'BBB-(rus)'; Outlook Stable Viability Rating: 'b-'
