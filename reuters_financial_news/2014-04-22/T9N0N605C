TOKYO, April 22 (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group <8411.T> said on Tuesday that it has named Hiroko Ota, former economics minister, as chairwoman of the board, as Japan's second-largest lender tries to revamp its corporate governance in the wake of a mob loan scandal.

Ota, currently professor at Tokyo-based National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, was economics minister in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's first administration in 2006-2008. Mizuho also said it named Takashi Kawamura, former chairman of Hitachi Ltd  <6501.T>, and Tatsuo Kainaka, lawyer, as outside directors.
