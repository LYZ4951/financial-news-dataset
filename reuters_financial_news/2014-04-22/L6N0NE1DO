MILAN, April 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> fell as much as 3 percent in early trade on Tuesday despite the successful conclusion of a 1.5 billion euro rights issue last week, with traders citing widespread profit-taking on Italian banking stocks.

Banco Popolare said on Friday that investors had taken up 99 percent of the new shares on offer. [nL6N0N94QN]
