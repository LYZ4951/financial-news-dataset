WELLINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Rises in exchange rates in recent years have hurt Asian economies, but capital controls are not the solution to the problem, the head of the New Zealand central bank said on Thursday.

Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said financial links across international borders present challenges for central bankers setting monetary policy. They cause exaggerated shifts in exchange rates and persistent, damaging deviations from economic fundamentals, he said. "This has generated difficult headwinds for those export producers not experiencing high prices for their products, and for firms competing against cheaper imports," Wheeler said in notes to a Bank of International Settlements conference on cross-border financial links. He said the best approach to reducing such pressure was to increase domestic savings, rather than change the exchange rate regime or impose capital controls.
