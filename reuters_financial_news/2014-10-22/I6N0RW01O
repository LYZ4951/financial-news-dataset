MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's third-biggest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> rose 2.5 percent in early morning trade on Wednesday, marking a second straight day of gains following a string of losses in recent weeks.

The lender's shares were trading at 0.89 euros apiece by 0717 GMT.  Its stock rose nearly nine percent on Tuesday as investors took a more upbeat view about the outcome of a European banking review. Prior losses were driven by speculation the review would uncover fresh capital shortfalls at the Tuscan bank.
