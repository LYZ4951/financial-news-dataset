BANGKOK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Property developer AP (Thailand) PCL <AP.BK> said on Wednesday it had raised its 2014 revenue target to 22 billion thai baht ($681 million) from 21 billion baht, and forecast growth of at least 10 percent next year.

Although the property sector was hit by a domestic political crisis early this year, AP performed strongly in the first half, especially in the category of single detached houses, the company's chief marketing officer, Vittakarn Chandavimol, told reporters.
