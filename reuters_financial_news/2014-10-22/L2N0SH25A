Oct 22 (Reuters) - Health insurer Humana Inc <HUM.N> is exploring a sale of its urgent care subsidiary Concentra in a deal that could value it at around $1 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter, less than four years after acquiring it.

The move indicates that Humana, one of the largest providers of Medicare plans for the elderly in the United States, has faced challenges with its attempts to run healthcare centers itself in order to better manage medical costs.
