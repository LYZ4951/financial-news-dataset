ZURICH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB) said on Wednesday it was in talks with Swiss investment fund provider Swisscanto Holding <SWIS.UL> about a possible takeover.

Local government-owned ZKB said in a statement that no decision had yet been made and it would not comment further on the talks. The cantonal bank said it was making the discussions public in response to a media report last week by Swiss finance website Finews.
