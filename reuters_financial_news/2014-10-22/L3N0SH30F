BANGKOK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hotel group Erawan Group Pcl <ERW.BK> expects to post a net profit in 2014 as Thailand's tourism and hotel industries  continue their recovery, the company's chairman said on Wednesday.

Prakit Pradipasen told reporters the company would conclude a plan later this year to establish a real estate investment trust (REIT). Erawan reported a net loss of 80 million baht ($2.47 million) in the first six months of 2014, partly because of the impact of a troubled domestic political situation on the tourism industry in the early months of the year.
