ZURICH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche <ROG.VX> said on Wednesday it would spend 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) to upgrade its Basel headquarters, a vote of confidence in its Swiss base despite ongoing uncertainty over the country's immigration laws.

The world's largest maker of cancer drugs will spend 1.7 billion francs on a new research building for 1,900 employees and will also build a new high-rise office block, which will house 1,700 workers at a cost of 550 million francs. A further 700 million francs will be spent on upgrading investing building and infrastructure, the company said in a statement. Roche traces its roots in the Swiss city to 1896, when Fritz Hoffman-La Roche set up the business that bears his name.
