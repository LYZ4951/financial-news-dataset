STRASBOURG, France, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The European Union's budget rules that limit the size of government deficits and public debt will not be weakened, the incoming president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker told European Parliament on Wednesday.

His statement comes as the EU executive is preparing a review of the rules and their effectiveness with a report due by the middle of December, while France and Italy are pushing for more leniency in required budget consolidation efforts.
