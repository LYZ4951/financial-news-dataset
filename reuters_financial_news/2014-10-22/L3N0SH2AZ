BANGKOK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets mostly gained on Wednesday, with shares of solar farm companies outperforming in Thailand after the Ministry of Energy raised its target to buy electricity from solar farm operators.

Thailand's energy ministry plans to purchase 800 megawatts of electricity from solar farms in 2014-2015, higher than its previous projection of 576 megawatts, Kurujit Nakornthap, deputy permanent secretary at the energy ministry, told reporters. Shares of mid- and small-cap solar farm companies such as Solartron Pcl <SOLAR.BK>, Gunkul Engineering Pcl <GUNKUL.BK>, Inter Far East Engineering Pcl <IFEC.BK> and Demco Pcl <DEMCO.BK> rose after the news.
