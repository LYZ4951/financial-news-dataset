Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures for June 2015 surged on Wednesday as the rest of the bond market was weaker on less worrisome data on domestic inflation. [US/]

On the Chicago Board of Trade, the price on the June 2015 30-year U.S. T-bond <USM5> jumped more than 10 points to a contract high at 151-25/32. Traders and analysts said the price move stemmed from a change in the mix of the cheapest U.S. government debt securities eligible for delivery against this T-bond contract, which had no open interest as of Tuesday. The CME said in an earlier statement it will exclude a February 2031 Treasury bond issue from eligibility for delivery for the June 2015, September 2015 and December 2015 T-bond contracts only.  While the CME Group's decision was known, a small group of players decided to position themselves on Wednesday ahead of increased trading of the June 2015 T-bond. Trading volume was this contract was light, although it began picking up mid-afternoon Wednesday as traders took note of the price spike.
