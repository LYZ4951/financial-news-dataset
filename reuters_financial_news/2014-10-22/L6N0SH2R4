LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Pimco's head of global banking, Philippe Bodereau, said he expects 18 banks to fail a stress test of regional lenders when results are published by the European Central Bank on Sunday.

Bodereau, who runs $4.3 billion in the Pimco GIS Capital Securities Fund, said the failures would likely include some German and Austrian cooperative and public sector banks, as well as weak regional lenders in the periphery.
