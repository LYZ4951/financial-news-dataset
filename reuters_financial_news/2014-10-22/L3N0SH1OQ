Oct 22 (Reuters) - Interdealer broker BGC Partners Inc <BGCP.O> plans to launch its $5.25-per-share tender offer for rival GFI Group Inc <GFIG.N> as early as Wednesday after attempts to strike a deal failed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Talks between the firms hit a roadblock over negotiations relating to a confidentiality agreement that would give BGC access to inside information about parts of GFI's business. In return GFI asked a pledge  from  BGC not to recruit its key employees, a request the two sides couldn't agree upon, the sources told WSJ. (http://on.wsj.com/1tc5UO6) BGC, run by Cantor Fitzgerald Chief Executive Howard Lutnick, launched a $675 million hostile bid for GFI on Sept. 9, topping an agreed offer from exchange operator CME Group Inc <CME.O>. [ID:nL1N0RA0C6] About a week later GFI's board of directors announced their support for the agreed-upon offer by CME as it had not determined if the BGC offer was superior to that of CME.
