LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - British insurer Standard Life <SL.L> and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) <601398.SS> said on Wednesday they had agreed to look at developing savings and investment services together.

The memorandum of understanding would see them "work together to identify opportunities for the benefit of both businesses in China, Hong Kong and the UK", they said in a statement. ICBC already works closely with Standard Life's joint venture in China, Heng An Standard Life, in which Standard Life has a 50 percent stake.
