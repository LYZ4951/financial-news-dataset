STOCKHOLM, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Swedish e-commerce firm CDON Group <CDON.ST> announced a major rights issue on Wednesday to fund the ongoing roll-out of its payment solution, and simultaneously said it will change its name to Qliro Group.

"We're seeing exciting days and are looking forward to the coming months," CDON chief executive Paul Fischbein told a telephone conference with analysts and journalists. But by 1016 GMT, CDON's shares traded 17.4 percent lower at 16.60 crowns, while the wider Stockholm share index <.OMXSPI> was up 0.4 percent. [ID:nL6N0SH1ST] Of the proceeds from the rights issue of approximately 650 million crowns ($89.81 million), around 300 million will be used to fund the continued launch of the Qliro Payment Solution.  The service has been tested on the company's Members.se site sine June and on Tretti.se since September, and later in the year it will be launched on the Swedish sites of Nelly, CDON.com and Lekmer. In 2015 it will debut on Gymgrossisten, and the company also plans to launch the payment system in Finland and Norway next year. "Now our new journey as Qliro Group begins," Fischbein said. For the third quarter CDON's operating result, excluding divested operations and non-recurring items, swung to a profit of 1.5 million Swedish crowns from a loss of 17.2 million last year, although analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a profit of 2.9 million. [ID:L6N0SB22D] The company said it expects Qliro Financial Services (QFS), the new segment in which the payment solution is included, to book an operating loss of about 10-15 million crowns in the fourth quarter related to the launch. In 2018 however, QFS is expected to contribute approximately 100 million crowns to the group's earnings before tax, it added. The remaining cash from the rights issue will be used to fund growth in the company's subsidiaries, especially Nelly, and to pay for an early redemption of convertible bonds.
