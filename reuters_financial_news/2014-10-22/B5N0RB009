STRASBOURG, France, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The incoming head of the EU executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the European Parliament on Wednesday that he would present his 300-billion-euro plan for investment to bolster growth and jobs by the end of this year.

Switching significantly to speaking in German during a keynote address ahead of a parliamentary vote to endorse his new European Commission, Juncker said: "If you give us your support today, we will present the jobs, growth and investment package before Christmas."
