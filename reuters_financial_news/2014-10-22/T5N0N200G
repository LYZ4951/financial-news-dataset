TORONTO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - The Canadian economy has "considerable excess capacity" and continued monetary stimulus is needed to close the gap, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a statement on Wednesday following the central bank's October monetary policy statement.

Poloz said forward guidance remained a key element of the bank's policy tool kit - but one reserved for times there are net benefits to its use. The bank had dropped any reference to taking a neutral stance on interest rates in its report and kept its key overnight rate at 1 percent. [ID:nL2N0SH16K]
