DUBAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>, Dubai's largest lender, beat analysts' forecasts on Wednesday as it reported a doubling of third-quarter net profit, aided by a fall in provisioning.

The lender, 55.6-percent owned by state fund Investment Corp of Dubai, made a net profit of 1.56 billion dirhams ($424.7 million) in the three months to September 30, a statement from the bank said, compared to 775 million dirhams in the same period last year. An average of five analysts polled by Reuters forecast a net profit of 1.16 billion dirhams for the third quarter. [ID:nL6N0S20OA]  ENBD's earnings have been given a lift in recent quarters by a resurgence in the Dubai economy, which has been boosted by a strengthening property market and a scaling down of debt troubles after a severe financial crisis.
