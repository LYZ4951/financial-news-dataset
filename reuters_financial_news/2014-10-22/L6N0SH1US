STOCKHOLM, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Swedish construction spending is expected to grow by 4 percent in 2015, down from an estimated 11 percent in the current year, according to a new forecast from the Swedish Construction Federation.

The lobby group had previously estimated 3 percent growth next year and 10 percent in 2014. New rules for mortgage amortisation and rising taxes are seen dampening the construction of new homes next year following a recent boom. Investments in housing is hence predicted to increase by 23 percent in 2014 but only 4 percent in 2015.
