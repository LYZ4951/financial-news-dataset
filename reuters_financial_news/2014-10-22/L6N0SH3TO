LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Romanian interest rates may fall further, and the decision on rates should rest on economic factors, not election uncertainty, central bank deputy governor Bogdan Olteanu told Reuters in an interview in London on Wednesday.

"I hope (election uncertainty) doesn't matter much," Olteanu said. A rate decision should be based on ``the domestic economic reality and on what our equivalents in the euro zone and in the neighbouring countries are doing," he said. Romania is holding a presidential election Nov. 2-16, with opinion polls backing current leftist Prime Minister Victor Ponta to win the vote. His first task would be to revive a deal with the International Monetary Fund which was put on hold because of disagreements over a tax cut, which he pushed for. Olteanu said the central bank's base-case scenario is that Romania will remain in its IMF programme. Official interest rates in Romania stand at 3 percent and analysts polled by Reuters expect the central bank to cut them by 25 basis points on Nov. 4, when the bank's new board meets for the first time. Olteanu also said inflation is expected to remain within the central bank's 1.5-3.5 percent target band for the next eight quarters, and by the end of this year may fall below the current 1.9 percent forecast. "It is possible end-year inflation will be slightly lower ... due to the weak economic situation in the euro zone, a second very good farming year in a row, and an influence from some agricultural exports destined for Russia being redirected to the domestic market," Olteanu said.
