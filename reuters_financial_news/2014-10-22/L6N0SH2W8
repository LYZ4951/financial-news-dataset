LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said HSBC <HSBA.L> had forced some small businesses to open an account with the bank to obtain a loan, breaking commitments made by banks to end the practice.

The Competition and Markets Authority said on Wednesday HSBC and First Trust Bank, which is part of AIB Group <ALBK.L>, had to immediately correct the practice and make it clear to staff and SME customers that obtaining a business loan is not dependent upon opening an account. British banks said in 2002 they would stop the practice - known as 'bundling' - to safeguard customer choice, the CMA said. "We regret that the bank has not been fully compliant with 'bundling' undertakings," a spokesman for HSBC said, adding the bank was working with the CMA to fully comply with the requirements.
