JOHANNESBURG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Namibia's central bank left its key lending rate unchanged at 6 percent, saying the decision was supportive of the economy and that it was monitoring the effects of recent policy decisions.

"Domestic growth prospects continued to be encouraging during the first eight months of 2014, while inflation declined," the Bank of Namibia said in a statement on Wednesday.
