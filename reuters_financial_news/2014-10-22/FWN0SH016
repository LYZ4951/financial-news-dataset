BERLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Lufthansa <LHAG.DE> said it will be offering 2.9 percent more seats for the 2014/2015 winter schedule, a slight increase on previous plans for a 2 percent increase.

While the number of flights is going down by 2.9 percent, employing larger aircraft has resulted in the increase in capacity - as measured in available seat-kilometres - Europe's largest airline by revenue said in a statement on Wednesday. Lufthansa had initially planned to increase capacity by 4 percent for the winter, but halved those plans after an influx of capacity in the first half put pressure on prices. [ID:nL6N0Q61IS]
