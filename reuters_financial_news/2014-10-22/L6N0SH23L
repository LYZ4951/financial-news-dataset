LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. insurer ACE <ACE.N> said on Wednesday it was excluding cover for Ebola on some new and renewal policies.

The company, which offers coverage for U.S.-based firms that travel or have operations outside the country, said it was selectively using a policy endorsement to exclude Ebola on a case-by-case basis for insureds that have foreign travel exposure to certain African countries.
