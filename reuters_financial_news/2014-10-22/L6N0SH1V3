BADEN-BADEN, Germany, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Europe's largest insurer Allianz <ALVG.DE> worries that a slide in reinsurance prices harbours the risk that some reinsurers won't earn enough to be prepared to pay up convincingly should disasters arise.

Reinsurers, who help insurers pay the cost of heavy damage claims for hurricanes or earthquakes, have cut prices for natural catastrophe coverage by a quarter in recent years, compounding a broad market price decline of 5-10 percent. [ID:nL6N0SF2YB][ID:nL6N0RG4OW] Falling prices are making it increasingly difficult for reinsurers to generate good returns, sapping their capital strength and, potentially, their ability to act as a financial backstop to insurers paying customers' flood or storm bills. "We need an equitable bargain between buyer and seller," said Amer Ahmed, chief executive of Allianz Re, the unit that handles internal and external reinsurance needs at Allianz. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's sees reinsurers' return on equity (ROE) falling to as low as 7 percent this year from an ROE averaging 14 percent over the five years to 2013. Reinsurers need compensation that can sustainably allow them to carry the risks on their books, otherwise it could lead to swings in capacity and price that would not be good for a well-functioning insurance system, Ahmed said. "My sense is that in some areas it is clearly below what is sustainable," he told Reuters in an interview in the southern German resort town of Baden-Baden, where reinsurers and insurance company clients have begun talks over prices and terms for reinsurance contracts to take effect in 2015.  OVERSUPPLY Reinsurance prices have been falling in part due to oversupply, as new players backed by pension and hedge funds move aggressively into the market, and also because global insurers like Allianz itself have cut back on the amount of reinsurance they buy, reducing demand. Allianz has trimmed its annual reinsurance spending by about 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) over the last eight years to around 4 billion euros, by consolidating purchases that used to be made by individual subsidiaries. "We are still bedding that down," Ahmed said, but added that the decline in purchases was effectively completed. Despite the cutback, Allianz remains a large buyer of catastrophe reinsurance and Ahmed's comments chime with those of the world's largest reinsurer, Munich Re <MUVGn.DE>, that while big losses may not occur every year, premiums must be adequate over the long term to cover those losses when they do happen. [ID:nL5N0RE0FH] While the reinsurance market overall is well capitalised at around $570 billion - two-thirds more than in 2008 - some individual players are underpricing risks and could get caught out by an uptick in large claims, industry observers say.  "I want to buy certainty; I want a product that will be available in the moment of truth," Ahmed said. Unlike many reinsurance buyers who see falling prices simply as a windfall, Ahmed said it was in Allianz's interest to make sure that its panel of 30 reinsurance suppliers was strong, and for that they needed to be adequately rewarded for the risk. Allianz is prepared to pay more to shift risks off of its books and for the certainty that its reinsurers will be there in times of trouble, Ahmed said. It is moving more risk per unit of premium to its reinsurers and expects to see them earn higher margins with more pronounced swings in profitability as a result, he said.
