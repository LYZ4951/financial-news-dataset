SHANGHAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - China shares finished weaker on Wednesday, reversing earlier gains, as the effects of a rebound in U.S. stock markets faded in the afternoon and weakness resurfaced.

Analysts said the market was still in a correction phase, thus a reversal was in line with expectations.  The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.6 percent at 2,326.4 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.6 percent. The pharmaceuticals-related sector continued underperforming the market due to profit-taking by investors. Jiangsu Lianhuan Pharmaceutical Co Ltd <600513.SS> declined 4.8 percent and Zhejiang Shapuaisi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd <603168.SS> dropped 4.5 percent.
