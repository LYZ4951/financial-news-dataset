FRANKFURT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Buying corporate bonds would be a way for the European Central Bank to expand its balance sheet, but the Governing Council has not yet discussed the idea and technical issues must first be addressed, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said.

Several sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters the ECB is considering buying corporate bonds on the secondary market and may decide on the matter as soon as December with a view to begin purchases early next year. [ID:nL6N0SG2VZ] Nowotny, Austria's central bank chief, told news agency MNI: "there has been no discussion about this in the Governing Council and no decision. Buying corporate bonds would have the effect of increasing the balance sheet, but one has to look first at the technical possibilities." Turning to quantitative easing (QE), Nowotny said this might get his support "if we were to see an imminent danger of a longer-lasting deflationary perspective".  "Still, we would have to look at the legal limits of our mandate," he added. "But we are not at this juncture yet."
