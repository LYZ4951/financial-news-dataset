STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European private equity firm CVC [CVC.UL] is in exclusive talks to acquire Finnish insulation material maker Paroc, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Reuters reported in August that CVC had submitted first-round bids for the asset along with TPG [TPG.UL], Nordic Capital, BC Partners and Cinven [CINV.UL], with bids valuing the company between 700 and 750 million euros ($950 million). Lazard <LAZ.N> has been running the sale for Paroc, which is owned by a consortium of banks and institutional investors, after being taken over by its lenders from Bahrain-based investment firm Arcapita in 2009.
