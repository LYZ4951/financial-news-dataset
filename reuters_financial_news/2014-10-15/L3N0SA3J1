HANOI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Vietnam Airlines is looking to sell a combined 20 percent stake to up to three foreign strategic partners by February 2015, a report by a consultant said.

While the national carrier would prefer a single foreign airline as a strategic partner, it is willing to consider overseas financial investors after its initial share sale, according to a privatisation plan published by Vietnam Airlines' consultant firm BIDV Securities late on Tuesday. (bsc.com.vn)
