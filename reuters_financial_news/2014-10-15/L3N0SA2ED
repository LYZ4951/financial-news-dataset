DUBAI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Bank Muscat <BMAO.OM>, Oman's largest lender, posted a 2.5 percent increase in its third-quarter net profit on Wednesday, narrowly missing analyst estimates.

The bank made a quarterly profit of 40.39 million rials ($104.9 million) in the three months to September 30, it said in a statement to the Muscat bourse. This compared to 39.4 million rials in the corresponding period of 2013. Five analysts polled by Reuters had, on average, forecast a third-quarter profit of 41.15 million rials. [ID:nL6N0PI1EJ] Net profit for the first nine months of 2014 was 126.7 million rials, up from 102.5 million rials in the opening nine months of last year, the filing said.
