SEOUL, Oct 15 (Reuters) - South Korean shares drifted lower in a choppy session on Wednesday as investors curbed aggressive bets amid nagging worries about slowing global economic growth.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed  0.2 percent lower at 1,925.91 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> firmed by a whisker as broad risk-off sentiment triggered safe-haven bids on the dollar, with market players indifferent to the Bank of Korea's decision to cut its policy base rate on Wednesday morning, which had been expected.
