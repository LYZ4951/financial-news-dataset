MADRID, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Spanish billionaire Esther Koplowitz, who controls builder FCC <FCC.MC>, has reached an agreement to refinance a debt of some 1 billion euros (1.26 billion US dollar) with creditor banks BBVA <BBVA.MC> and Bankia <BKIA.MC>, Expansion reported on Wednesday.

The finalisation of the agreement is imminent, Expansion said without citing sources.  The Koplowitz family owns B-1998 which, in turn, holds just over 50 percent of FCC. The deal gives the family an extra five years to pay back the debt and will unblock a capital hike by the builder to pay off the 1.35 billion euro tranche, or 'Tranche B', of its 4.5-billion-euro debt restructuring plan.
