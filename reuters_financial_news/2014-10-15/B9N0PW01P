The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 0.6 percent at 2,374.3 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 0.7 percent. China's producer price index in September fell 1.8 percent  from a year earlier, versus a 1.6 percent fall expected by analysts. It was the 31st consecutive monthly decline, highlighting the pressures that Chinese companies are facing as demand cools and putting increasing strain on their finances. [ID:nnL3N0S43JB]
