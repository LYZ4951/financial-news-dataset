PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A sell-off in European stocks accelerated on Wednesday, with a key index suffering its biggest one-day slide in nearly three years, as investors slashed exposure to risky assets such as equities on mounting worries about global growth.

Greek equities featured among the worst losers, as Athens's benchmark ATG index <.ATG> succumbed to a second day of selling pressure and sank 6.3 percent. Traders cited political uncertainty and a spike in Greek 10-year bond yields, which rose above 7.6 percent.
