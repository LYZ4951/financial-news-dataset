Oct 15 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, the second-largest U.S. bank, reported a quarterly loss applicable to common shareholders, largely due to a huge mortgage settlement with the U.S. government.

The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank posted a net loss attributable to shareholders of $70 million, or 1 cent per share for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a year-earlier profit of $2.22 billion, or 20 cents per share. [ID:nBwVLQ91a] Net income including preferred stock dividends fell to $168 million from $2.5 billion. The bank agreed in August to pay a record $16.65 billion to resolve accusations that it misled investors into buying mortgage bonds that ended up going sour, resolving the bulk of its legal issues stemming from the financial crisis.
