LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday, weighed down by UK healthcare stocks after U.S. suitor AbbVie Inc <ABBV.N> said it would reconsider its bid for UK pharmaceutical firm Shire <SHP.L>.

Shares in Shire fell nearly 30 percent in early deals after AbbVie said it intended to reconsider its recommendation to shareholders to vote in favor of the 32 billion pound ($54.7 billion) merger with Shire Plc due to the changing U.S. tax regulations. [ID:nL3N0SA0HR] Other UK healthcare stocks such as AstraZeneca <AZN.L>, which turned down a Pfizer <PFE.N> approach earlier this year, also fell as the chances of a bid from U.S. suitors were seen as diminishing.
