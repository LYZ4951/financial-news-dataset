MILAN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> confirmed it plans to exit its seven-year investment in Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI>, the bank's CEO Carlo Messina said on Wednesday on the sidelines of an event.

Speaking to reporters, Messina said the Italian bank has had no contact with Vivendi <VIV.PA> Chairman Vincent Bollore about forming a pact to control Telecom Italia. Vivendi has agreed to take a stake in Telecom Italia as part of a deal to sell a Brazilian broadband company to Spain's Telefonica <TEF.MC>.
