BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Greece's partners in the euro zone believe Athens is changing its mind about giving up on their financial help next year and might ask for a credit line to replace funds from the IMF.

Euro zone officials told Reuters that Greece seemed to be having second thoughts about a return to purely market funding after pressure from EU powers - and from investors who sold off Greek bonds this week. They also said Europeans were resisting a push by Athens to end borrowing from the IMF, which is unpopular in Greece and causing political problems.
