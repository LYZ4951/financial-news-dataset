MILAN, Oct 15 (Reuters) - UniCredit <CRDI.MI> has sold a portfolio of non-performing loans with a nominal value of 1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion) to AnaCap Financial Partners as part of efforts to clean up its balance sheet, the chief executive of Italy's biggest bank by assets said.

The sale comes after a similar deal with the same private equity firm in December last year on a 700 million euro bad loan pool and is part of the bank's plan to strengthen its finances ahead of the outcome of a Europe-wide bank asset review later this month.

"It is part of our ongoing effort of reducing the non-performing loan portfolio." Ghizzoni said last week his bank was in talks to sell more bad loan portfolios, without elaborating on the potential bidders.  The lender will also discuss the sale of its UCCMB bad loan unit at a board meeting on Thursday. The sale could yield 700 million euros and sees a consortium comprising U.S. asset manager Fortress <FIG.N> and Italian property group Prelios <PCRE.MI> pitted against a group of investors led by U.S. private equity fund Lone Star.
