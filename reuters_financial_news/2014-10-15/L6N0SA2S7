PRAGUE, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Private equity fund Abris Capital Partners has acquired an approximately 95 percent stake in Czech used car dealer AAA Auto for 220 million euros ($279.84 million), AAA Auto said on Wednesday.

AAA Auto said Abris, a central European-based private equity group with offices in Warsaw, Bucharest and Kiev, would offer minority shareholders a buyout for remaining shares. Abris's purchase price of roughly 94 crowns per share is above the closing price of 24 crowns on July 3, 2013, the stock's last trading day before it was de-listed from the Prague Stock Exchange. Czech anti-monopoly authorities have already approved the acquisition but regulatory approvals are still needed in Slovakia, Russia and Ukraine, AAA Auto said. The car dealer operates in the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian and Russian markets, while Abris also needs regulatory approval in Ukraine because of investments it has in the country, an AAA Auto spokesman said.
