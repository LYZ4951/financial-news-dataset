ROME, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Italian utility Enel expects to receive binding bids for its Slovak power plant Slovenske Elektrarn and its Romanian distribution and generation assets by the end of November, Chief Executive Officer Francesco Starace said on Wednesday.

The Romanian sales process is slightly ahead of the one in Slovakia, but offers for all assets should be in by the end of next month, Starace said in testimony to parliament.
