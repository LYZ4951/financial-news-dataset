MOSCOW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Wednesday it had shifted boundaries of its floating rouble corridor by 35 kopecks, following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline.

As of Oct. 14, the new corridor extended from 36.70 to 45.70 against a dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX>, compared with 36.35 to 45.35 previously.
