BRASILIA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Brazilian central bank on Wednesday eased reserve requirements on term deposits for commercial banks that step up short-term corporate loans, in a move aimed at stimulating economic growth.

With the changes in requirements policymakers are seeking to ease potential blockages in the availability of short-term credit for companies of all sizes at a time when borrowing costs are hovering at their highest levels in almost three years. In recent months, leading default indicators have showed a slight uptick in loan delinquencies at small- and mid-sized companies, which are struggling with four years of weak growth, rising costs and narrowing profit margins.
