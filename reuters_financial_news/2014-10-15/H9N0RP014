HONG KONG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing on Wednesday urged pro-democracy protesters who have occupied the heart of the city for more than two weeks to go home to their families, a day after 45 people were arrested following clashes with police.

Li, Asia's richest man and chairman of property developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <0001.HK>, also said in a statement that if the rule of law broke down it would be the "greatest sorrow" for the Chinese-controlled city.
