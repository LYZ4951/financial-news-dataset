MOSCOW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Russia's newly announced foreign exchange deposits will carry a term of one month or longer, a senior Finance Ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Earlier in the day, the Finance Ministry said that auctions for the new deposits, aimed at smoothing volatility of the rouble, will start within a month. [ID:nL6N0SA0WV]
