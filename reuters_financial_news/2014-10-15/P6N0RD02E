PARIS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European stocks extended their steep losses on Wednesday following data showing U.S. producer prices fell for the first time in over a year, fuelling worries of falling U.S. inflation.

At 1253 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 2.1 percent at 1,265.71 points, a level not seen since early February. The index has tumbled 10.4 percent since mid-September, as mounting worries over the strength of the global economy has spooked investors. Greek equities featured among the top losers on Wednesday, with Athens's benchmark ATG index <.ATG> sinking 9.1 percent, succumbing to a second day of selling pressure, with traders citing political uncertainty jitters and a spike in Greek 10-year bond yields, rising above 7.6 percent.
