BANGKOK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets were mostly higher on Wednesday, with the Indonesian benchmark extending gains for a second session although caution remained over the issue of fuel subsidy, while some Thai banks rose amid quarterly earnings.

Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> rose almost 1 percent amid mixed fund flows into large-caps. It ended 0.2 percent higher in the previous session. Shares of Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> were up 2.9 percent, with foreign investors buying a net 147 billion rupiah ($12 million). Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK>, Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> and Bank Negara Indonesia <BBNI.JK> fell amid foreign-led selling. Broker Trimegah Securities said in a report it expected the market to continue its rebound on Wednesday, but added that a sizable fuel price hike would be needed to signal a sustainable strengthening of the index. Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> rose 0.5 percent, adding to Tuesday's gains. Bank stocks led the gains, including TMB Bank <TMB.BK> after it reported a 27 percent surge in quarterly earnings. [ID:nL3N0S834Z] State-run Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> was among the outperformers, up almost 1 percent. Broker Maybank KimEng Securities said it expected the bank to post a 3 percent year-on-year growth in quarterly earnings. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and the Philippines <.PSI> gained modestly, while Malaysia <.KLSE> and Vietnam <.VNI> drifted into negative territory. Asian stocks regained a semblance of stability on Wednesday following days of steep losses, but sentiment remained fragile as benign Chinese inflation data and gloom in the euro zone economy added to signs of a faltering global economic recovery.
