NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The cost for insuring Venezuelan sovereign debt against default or restructuring surged on Wednesday as global oil prices swooned to a 27-month low before rebounding, illustrating rising investor concerns over Caracas's ability to service its debt.

An investor wanting to insure a $10 million trade for five years would need to spend $4.175 million as an up front cost. In addition they would have to pay $500,000 annually, for the duration of the credit default swap contract, according to data provider Markit. On Tuesday the up front cost was $3.868 million. <VEGV5YUSAC=MG> The cost to insure a portfolio of Venezuelan sovereign debt for five years has nearly tripled in the last four months. The up front cost was just below $1.5 million in late June.  "There's panic over whether they are going to be able to pay. That great concern is reflected in the market with yields touching 30 percent," Russ Dallen, head of Caracas Capital Markets in Miami, said in reference to yields on debt issued by state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).
