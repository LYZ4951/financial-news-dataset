BEIJING, Oct 15 (Reuters) - China International Capital Corp (CICC) chairman, Jin Liqun, plans to resign from his post this year, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

"If there are no surprises, Jin Liqun will submit his resignation within the next two months," said one source. The sources added that Jin plans to take up a position at Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Beijing-led effort which analysts say is aimed at extending its influence in the region. A public relations official at CICC declined to comment.
