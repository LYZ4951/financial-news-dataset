LIMA, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Peru's central bank said it will gradually raise the foreign investment limit on the country's private pension funds by two percentage points to 42 percent of assets managed in January.

The current ceiling, 40 percent, will increase by half a percentage point every month starting in October, the central bank said.
