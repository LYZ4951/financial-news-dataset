HANOI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> fell 0.43 percent to 622.97 at the break on Thursday on losses in big-cap shares during the review week of exchange-traded funds (ETF).

The Market Vectors Vietnam <VNM.P> and db x-trackers FTSE Vietnam <XFVT.DE> ETFs are expected to sell many shares from their portfolios, which mostly consist of blue chips, during this quarterly review ending Friday, analysts said. PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's biggest firm by market value, fell 0.84 percent, followed by Petrovietnam Drilling & Well Services Corp <PVD.HM> with a 2.88 percent drop. PVD, which led the gains of stocks in the oil and gas sector over the past few weeks, was on track for a second fall after closing at a record high on Tuesday, Reuters data showed. "But many big-caps have fallen to their support levels, while money inflow into small- and mid-cap stocks are still solid," said analyst Pham Van Khoa of VNDIRECT Securities. The index' support level is 620, he said. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).VN Index   622.97 PREV.
