SEOUL, Sept 18 (Reuters) - South Korean shares fell on Thursday, pulled down by a sharp plunge in Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> and its affiliates, who will pay more than $10 billion for a Seoul plot where it plans to build a new global headquarters.

Shares in Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> and its sister company Kia Motors <000270.KS> fell 9.2 percent and 7.8 percent respectively on news of the group's winning bid of $10.14 billon, about three times the land's appraised value. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> fell 0.72 percent to close at 2,047.74 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> fell to a fresh 5-month low as the dollar rallied against a broad range of currencies, with investors feeling hawkish about the timing of the next U.S interest rate hike.
