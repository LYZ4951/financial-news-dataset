LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Money manager C-View said it would launch a currency trading strategy later this month to be managed by former Standard Chartered Bank's <STAN.L> managing director Buford Scott.

The C-View Stelrox Systematic Currency Strategy will invest in G10, emerging market, and trend-following strategies, C-View's founder, Paul Chappell, said in a statement on Thursday. Chappell, in a telephone interview, declined to say how much capital the fund would start with. Scott, who moved out of Standard Chartered to start Stelrox Capital Management, will be the chief investment officer of the strategy, while C-View will provide operational support, marketing and risk management to the strategy.
