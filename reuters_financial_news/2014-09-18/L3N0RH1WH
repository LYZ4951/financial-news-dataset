HONG KONG, Sept 18 (Reuters) - UK independent fund manager City Financial is looking to double its Hong Kong staff in coming months, looking to benefit from an increase in investment flows to the region and launch a second hedge fund, Chief Executive Andrew Williams said in an interview.

The firm has started discussions with fund managers to form a new team, adding to the nine already at City Financial's office in Hong Kong's financial district, Williams told Reuters. The new fund will have a "complementary strategy" to the Counterpoint Asian Macro Fund managed by Geoffrey Barker, who was previously with Ballingal Investment Advisors. The new fund will target long/short investments in China equities and a variety of Asian credits, he added.
