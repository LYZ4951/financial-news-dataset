WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The former top U.S. tax prosecutor who helped secure $2.6 billion in penalties and a guilty plea from Credit Suisse AG <MLPN.P> on charges the Swiss bank helped Americans hide money overseas, joined the law firm DLA Piper, the firm said on Thursday.

Kathryn Keneally, who led the tax division at the U.S. Department of Justice, will join the firm's New York office next month.
