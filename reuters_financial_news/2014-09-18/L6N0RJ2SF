LISBON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The new chief executive of Portugal's Novo Banco - the successor to Banco Espirito Santo after a state rescue - said on Thursday his management team will work on adding new clients, growing deposits and loans rather than just preparing the bank's sale.

"Our mandate is clear, to recover and create value for our institution, so that it regains its leadership in the market," Eduardo Stock da Cunha wrote in a letter to employees, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
