NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A handful of large shareholders are calling on nutritional supplement retailer Vitamin Shoppe Inc <VSI.N> to consider a sale to private equity or larger rival GNC Holdings Inc <GNC.N>, according to people familiar with the matter.

At least one activist fund has held conversations with members of the Vitamin Shoppe board about a potential sale and is considering whether to go public with their push, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Vitamin Shoppe is just the latest retailer being targeted by activist investors, who are also pushing for the sale of companies like Petsmart Inc <PETM.O> and Ann Inc <ANN.N>. The investor push comes after shares of North Bergen, New Jersey-based Vitamin Shoppe have fallen over 16 percent so far this year to a market capitalization of around $1.3 billion. Chief Executive Tony Truesdale also announced plans to retire in June 2015.
