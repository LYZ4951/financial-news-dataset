STOCKHOLM, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Europe's biggest online fashion retailer Zalando's <ZLDO.F> second quarter growth rate of 25 percent is sustainable going forward, its chief financial officer Jan Kemper told main owner Kinnevik's capital markets day on Thursday.

He added no decisions had been taken on new geographies, but said the most probable step would be to go to Eastern Europe.
