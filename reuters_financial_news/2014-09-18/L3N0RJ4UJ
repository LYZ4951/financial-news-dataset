Sept 18 (Reuters) - Thirty-five underwriters are working to ensure that Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's [IPO-BABA.N] initial public offering lives up to its blockbuster expectations when the stock starts trading on Friday.

The entire syndicate is divided into three tiers, with the six joint bookrunners on top, followed by eight banks who had been invited to analyst meetings and prepared analysis to help value Alibaba, sources told Reuters earlier this month. A third tier of banks helped sell the deal.
