HONG KONG, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished lower on Thursday after weak Chinese housing data heightened concerns of a deepening downtrend in the property sector that is weighing on the broader economy.

China's new home prices fell in August for a fourth straight month and declines spread to a record number of cities. [ID:nL3N0RJ18B] The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended 0.9 percent down at 24,168.72 points after it snapped an eight-day decline on Wednesday by rising 1 pct. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also slid 0.9 percent. Property stocks were some of the heaviest hit. China Resources Land <1109.HK> sank 2.8 percent, a leading percentage loser on the Hang Seng, and China Overseas Land & Investment <0688.HK> shed 1.8 percent. China Mobile <0941.HK> declined 1.2 percent to a three-week closing low, while China Unicom <0762.HK> skidded 1.7 percent. Telcos have been under pressure since a Tuesday report on the 21st Century Business Herald said Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> iPhone 6 is not likely to enter the mainland market this year.
