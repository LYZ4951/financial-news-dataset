Sept 18 (Reuters) - LPL Financial, the largest U.S. independent broker-dealer by sales force, said it added an independent financial advisory group to its network.

StreamSong Advisors, which managed more than $1.2 billion in assets as of December, is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with another office in Detroit. StreamSong targets a clientele with at least $500,000 in investable assets. The six-member team, including two advisers, plans to offer advisory services for private clients and ultra-high-net-worth households. The team has experience in mergers and acquisitions, and in taxes and estate planning.
