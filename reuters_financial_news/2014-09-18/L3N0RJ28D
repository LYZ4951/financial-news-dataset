The world's two most populous nations used the summit to sign agreements to boost their commercial and trade ties, even as a dispute over their shared border overshadowed Xi's three-day visit to India that ends on Friday.  Here are some of the key announcements:  China will set up two industrial parks in India: one for power equipment in Modi's home state of Gujarat and another for automotive parts in the western Maharashtra state. New investments from China could help India reduce its trade deficit.  India and China signed a five-year plan to promote trade relations.

Both developing countries decided to work together to steer regional cooperation and advance their efforts to build the BCIM (Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar) economic corridor.  China will support India in reforming its crumbling railways by helping it improve the speed of trains. Redevelopment of railway stations and collaboration on high-speed trains will also be explored.

On Wednesday, business leaders from the two countries signed deals worth $3.43 billion in New Delhi.
