WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Siemens Building Technologies is recalling about 9,000 smoke detector fire alarms because they can fail to sound, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Thursday.

Four models of smoke detectors - Desigo, Faraday, H-Series and Cerberus - use the SBGA-34 audible base that is being recalled, the commission said in a statement. The detectors are used in a total of nine Siemens, Desigo, Cerberus and Faraday alarm systems, it said.  The alarms were made in China and imported by the Buffalo Grove, Illinois, company, a unit of Germany's Siemens AG <SIEGn.DE>.
