HONG KONG, Sept 18 (Reuters) - China shares held onto slim gains on Thursday, as a jump in banking stocks outweighed falling property developers hurt by weak housing data.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> edged up 0.4 percent to 2,315.90 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings closed up 0.3 percent. Property companies were among the hardest hit. China's new home prices fell in August for a fourth straight month and declines spread to a record number of cities, underlining a deepening downtrend in the property market that is increasingly weighing on the broader economy. [ID:nL3N0RJ18B] Gemdale Corp <600383.SS> shed 2.9 percent, while Poly Real Estate Group <600048.SS> lost 0.9 percent. Bank shares outperformed buoyed by reform measures in financial firms and reports about the central bank's effort to boost liquidity. China Citic Bank  <601998.SS> climbed 4.6 percent, Bank of Communications <601328.SS> added 1.9 percent, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank <600000.SS> rose 1.7 percent.
