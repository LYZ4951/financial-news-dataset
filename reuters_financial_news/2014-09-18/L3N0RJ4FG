ABU DHABI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways is on track to raise about $2 billion in loans this year to fund its equity investments around the world and aircraft purchases, its chief financial officer said on Thursday.

"Last year we raised approximately $2 billion, this year we are on track to raise approximately $2 billion," James Rigney told reporters on the sidelines of an aviation conference in Abu Dhabi. "The primary focus of that money is aircraft-related, and also for investments made in equity." The funds would be raised through loans, he said, declining to name the lenders.
