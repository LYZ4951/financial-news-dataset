MOSCOW, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said on Thursday the arrest of businessman Vladimir Yevtushenkov had impacted Russia's business climate and would increase capital flight.

"This is certainly reflected in the investment climate. It is clear that the suspicion that there is some economic motive behind this complicates investors' decision-making," he told reporters.
