SHANGHAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - The former chairman of China Guangfa Bank Co Ltd, part-owned by Citigroup Inc. <C.N>, is being investigated on suspicion of taking bribes, prosecutors said on Thursday, the latest official caught up in a widening corruption crackdown.

President Xi Jinping's push to counter graft and extravagance has ensnared a series of senior bankers, with the 2013 investigation into the former vice president of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd <601288.SS> being one of the most high-profile.  An investigation into Li Ruohong, chairman of Guangfa from 1999 to 2009, is going on, said prosecutors in Guangdong, a southern province in China, in a notice posted on The Supreme People's Procuratorate official website.  They did not elaborate on the allegations or say how long the investigation would take. A Guangfa Bank official declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, merely saying the bank "did not have a grasp of the situation at present". Li could not be reached for comment.
