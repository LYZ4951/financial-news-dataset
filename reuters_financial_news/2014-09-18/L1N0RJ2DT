TORONTO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp <COST.O>, which will stop accepting American Express Co <AXP.N> cards in Canada beginning in the new year, has chosen to partner with Capital One Financial Corp <COF.N>, according to a media report on Thursday.

MasterCard Inc <MA.N> will process the transactions, a report by Bloomberg News said, citing a person familiar with the deal. Capital One and Costco could not be immediately reached for comment. Costco, which sells everything from jewelry to fresh produce at its cavernous members-only stores, notified customers on Wednesday that it would not be renewing its relationship with American Express once it expired on Dec 31. [ID:nL3N0RJ1Q5] Warehouses and gas stations located in the United States will continue to accept American Express cards in the new year, according to the letter to customers, except for the TrueEarnings and American Express Platinum Cash Rebate cards issued in Canada.
