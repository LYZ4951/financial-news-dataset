SAO PAULO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - An expected global monetary tightening poses limited risks for Brazilian corporate borrowers in international markets, which could face an increase in borrowing costs and a reduction in the supply of financing, the nation's central bank said on Thursday.

The global economy is moving towards a moment of transition in which companies will face tougher financing conditions, according to the bank's latest semiannual report on the stability of the domestic financial industry.
