PARIS, Sept 18 (Reuters) - European stocks inched higher in early trade on Thursday, tracking gains on Wall Street after the U.S. Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to keep ultra-low interest rates for a "considerable time".

At 0703 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,388.64 points. On Wednesday, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to keep interest rates near zero for a "considerable time," and repeated concerns over slack in the labor market, standing firm against calls to overhaul its policy statement. [ID:nW1N0Q400M] However, the Fed also indicated it could raise borrowing costs faster than expected when it starts moving. The central bank's new rate projections suggested officials were positioning themselves for a potentially faster pace of rate hikes than they had envisioned when the last set of forecasts were released in June. UK stocks underperformed in early trade, with the FTSE 100 <.FTSE> up 0.1 percent - less than gains of 0.4 percent on Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and 0.2 percent on France's CAC <.FCHI>.
