MUMBAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Indian shares surged nearly 2 percent on Thursday, posting their biggest daily gain in over three months, on hopes foreign buying would continue as country can better weather any Fed-related volatility due to improving fundamentals.

Traders said a report from news channel Zee Business that Standard & Poor's would raise its outlook on India to "stable" from "negative" also boosted shares. S&P officials were not immediately reachable for comment. Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS> provisionally rose 3.8 percent, while Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> ended 3.4 percent higher.
