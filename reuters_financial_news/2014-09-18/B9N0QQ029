BEIJING, Sept 18 (Reuters) - China should avoid cutting interest rates if possible and try other strategies instead to keep the broad measure of money supply, M2, growing at an annual rate of around 13 percent, an adviser to the country's central bank said on Thursday.

Chen Yulu, a member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, said China could use open market operations or selectively cut reserve requirements for some banks to lower borrowing costs.
