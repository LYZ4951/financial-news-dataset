COPENHAGEN, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Proposed tighter guidelines to reduce the number of interest-only and adjustable-rate loans in Denmark could reduce risk in the country's relatively large mortgage bond sector, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) said.

The new guidelines were proposed by the Financial Service Authority (FSA) last week to accommodate amongst others the international rating agencies who have voiced concerns about the large amount of these types of loans, which are seen as more risky should international debt markets freeze up. "We anticipate that, over time, these measures could help to reduce the proportion of outstanding interest-only loans in Denmark, potentially lowering credit risk in Danish covered bond pools," S&P said in a earlier this week. S&P believes the new rules may also further reduce refinancing risk for the mortgage lenders, a topic the government has also addressed in a bill passed in February which changed some loan auction rules.[ID:nL5N0LB4EZ]  The main mortgage lenders are Nykredit[FRNYKR.UL], Totalkredit [FRNYKT.UL], Danske Bank's <DANSKE.CO> Realkredit Danmark, Nordea's <NDA.ST> Nordea Kredit, BRFkredit[BRFFOK.UL] and DLR [DLRKR.UL]. The rules, S&P said, could also reduce the risk for borrowers who have sharply increased mortgage payments, so-called 'payment shocks', by pushing them away from adjustable-rate loans. "That said, potentially lower availability of such loans may push up borrowing costs, potentially constraining house prices," S&P said. Denmark's economic growth has stalled since a property bubble burst in 2008. Property prices in Denmark are still below pre-crisis levels but the market has been getting warmer since late 2011. Danes' debts average three times their disposable income and are worth 148 percent of national output, more than any other nation in the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Interest-only loans amount to 820 billion Danish crowns ($142 billion) of the total 1.4 trillion crown market, and one-year adjustable rate loans, which are refinanced at large auctions every year, totals around 930 billion crowns.
