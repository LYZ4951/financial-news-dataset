LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Canada has cancelled sanctions against Expobank, one of two small Russian banks on which it imposed the measures earlier this year, Expobank said in a statement on Thursday.

The firm, which ranks as about the 100th biggest Russian bank by assets, has always disputed its inclusion on the sanctions list had and had appealed to be taken off. "We were sure that the inclusion of Expobank on this list was a misunderstanding and a mistake. We are glad that this issue has been resolved successfully and quickly and that this issue has been removed from the agenda," Kirill Nifontov, chief executive of Expobank, said in a statement. No-one was immediately available for comment in the office of Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird, who is in charge of the sanctions list.
