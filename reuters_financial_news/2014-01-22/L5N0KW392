MADRID, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC>, Spain's sixth biggest bank, is expected to report yearly profits almost tripled in 2013 on Thursday, while its net lending income is forecast to have improved in the last three months of the year.

Sabadell is predicted to post a 2013 net profit of 216 million euros ($293 million), up 164 percent from the year before, according to the averaged forecasts of seven analysts polled by Reuters. These gains are mainly down to lower provisions on property losses and a series of acquisitions integrated throughout 2013, while the bank has also made big gains in its bond trading portfolio, primarily containing public debt. Net interest income (NII), a closely-watched measure reflecting the difference between funding costs and payouts on loans, is seen dropping 4.1 percent in 2013 versus the year before. But in the fourth quarter of 2013, NII is forecast to improve 5 percent to 474 million euros compared to the previous three months, according to the averaged estimates of five analysts.
