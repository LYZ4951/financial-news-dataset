MILAN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna <EMII.MI> is not talking to smaller peer Banca Etruria <PEL.MI> about a possible tie up even though such a move could be interesting, its chief executive said on Wednesday.

"We have nothing specific on the table," Luigi Odorici said on the sidelines of a meeting of banking lobby ABI. "From our point of view it could be an interesting operation with Etruria because it covers an area where we don't have a big market share," he added. Earlier on Wednesday a Banca Popolare di Vicenza executive said the bank was considering a possible investment in Banca Etruria, which is looking for a partner following recommendations from the Bank of Italy.
