JAKARTA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> said on Wednesday its net profit rose 14 percent in 2013 from a year earlier, driven by solid loan growth, and has set aside 3 trillion rupiah ($247.3 million) for potential acquisitions.

The lender reported a net profit of 21.35 trillion rupiah ($1.76 billion) for the full year ended December, up from 18.7 trillion rupiah in 2012, as loans grew 24 percent. It is targeting a 10-12 percent growth in net profit and 15-17 percent growth in loans this year. Bank Rakyat could make acquisitions of other lenders as well as insurance and securities firms, President Director Sofyan Basir told reporters. The Indonesian bank, which currently rents satellite equipment from other companies, has also earmarked $250 million to invest in its own satellite assets to improve its services, Basir said. Maybank Kim Eng upgraded the stock on Tuesday to "buy" from "hold" after raising its 2014 earnings estimate by 5 percent to 23.6 trillion rupiah. Its target price for the stock, one of its top picks in the sector, is 10,000 rupiah. Bank Rakyat's yield seems to have improved as it was able to pass on higher funding costs to its borrowers, Maybank said. "One of BRI's biggest advantages during the rising interest rates environment is that micro borrowers are less sensitive to a pickup in lending rates given the small number of banks that are able reach down to this segment."
