NAIROBI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The weighted average yield on Kenya's 10-year Treasury bond <KE10YT=RR> slipped to 12.180 percent at auction on Wednesday from 12.371 percent in August, the central bank said.    The weighted average yield on the six-months Treasury bills <KE6MT=RR>, which were also on sale, fell to 10.339 percent from 10.344 percent at last week, while that of the one-year bills <KE1YT=RR> edged up to 10.689 percent from 10.665 percent at last week's sale.

The central bank received four times offers for the 10 billion shillings ($116.55 million) worth of the 10-year bond on sale and accepted 15 billion shillings, it said. Investors shunned the Treasury bills auction, with the bank receiving a 21 percent subscription rate for the six-months paper and a 49 percent subscription rate for the one-year bills, it said.
