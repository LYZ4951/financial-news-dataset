KAMPALA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> posted gains for a third consecutive day on Wednesday, thanks to good dollar inflows that led banks to cut their greenback holdings, amid sluggish demand.

Commercial banks quoted the currency of Africa's biggest coffee exporter at 2,478/2,483 to the dollar at 1131 GMT, stronger than Tuesday's close of 2,484/2,489. "Banks are going short on their dollar positions because of poor demand but we also have inflows from exporters of commodities like coffee," said Manohar Miryala, head of treasury at Crane Bank. The shilling is seen firming in the short term on the back of scanty demand for dollars from importers but traders say the local currency's medium to long-term outlook is clouded by the conflict in neighbouring South Sudan. The United Nations says thousands of people have been killed in a month of clashes pitting troops loyal to President Salva Kiir against rebels supporting Riek Machar, who was sacked as vice president in July.
