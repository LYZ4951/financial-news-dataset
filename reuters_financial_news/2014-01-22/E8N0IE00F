MADRID, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Mid-sized Spanish lender Bankinter <BKT.MC> on Wednesday reported a 73 percent jump in profit for 2013 compared to the year before, largely thanks to lower provisions against losses after it cleaned up soured property assets in 2012.

The bank made a net profit of just over 215 million euros ($291 million) for the year, beating forecasts by analysts in a Reuters poll for a 211.5 million euro profit.
