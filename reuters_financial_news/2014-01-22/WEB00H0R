VIENNA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Berenberg Bank upgraded Raiffeisen Bank International  <RBIV.VI> to "hold" from "sell" on Wednesday and raised its price target to 29 euros from 12 after the Austrian lender announced a long-anticipated capital increase. [ID:nL5N0KV3HQ]

"This should also mark the end of Raiffeisen's 13-month underperformance relative to European banks since our downgrade to sell, in our view," analyst Eleni Papoula said in a note.  "We can be more positive if the increased free float and its influence... trigger a focus on shareholder value, while new investors may be able to get a better valuation during the accelerated book-building."
