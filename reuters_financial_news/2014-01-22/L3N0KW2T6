HANOI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed down 1.43 percent on Wednesday, ending a 13-session run of gains as investors booked profits from large-cap stocks, analysts said.

Investors sold blue chips that gained strongly over the past sessions, including steel producer Hoa Phat Group <HPG.HM>, which plummeted 6.48 percent and food producer Ma San <MSN.HM>, which lost 4.15 percent. Property firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> fell 3.14 percent and PetroVietNam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's largest listed firm by capitalisation, dropped 2.6 percent. Gains in other blue chips prevented bigger losses, among them top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM>, which climbed 1.69 percent and Sacombank <STB.HM>, which rose 0.47 percent. Sacombank had a net profit before tax of 2.84 trillion dong ($134.6 million) in 2013, more than double its annual target, state media quoted the bank's chairman as saying on Wednesday.
