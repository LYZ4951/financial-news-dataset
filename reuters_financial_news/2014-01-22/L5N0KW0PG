LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - European shares climbed higher to trade near a 5-1/2-year peak in early trading on Wednesday, with ASML <ASML.AS> leading the technology sector higher after posting impressive results.

The STOXX Europe 600 technology index <.SX8P> rose 0.8 percent, the top sectoral gainer, helped by a 3.5 percent rise in ASML <ASML.AS> after the world's leading provider of tools for making computer chips reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter results. [ID:nL5N0KW09J] At 0816 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,350.90 points after rising as high as 1,353.47 in the previous session, a level not seen since mid-2008.  However, the index was vulnerable to a pull-back as its 14-day relative strength rose above 70, an "overbought" technical condition that often triggers in a sell-off, analysts said.
