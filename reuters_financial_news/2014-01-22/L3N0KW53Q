SYDNEY, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares could fall on Wednesday if bluechip miners  take a beating after iron ore fell to its weakest level in over six months, while investors may exercise caution after Wall Street finished mostly flat overnight.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.4 percent, a 61.8 point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark slipped 0.2 percent on Wednesday.  * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 0.2 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks closed mostly flat as the latest corporate earnings came in mixed and a selloff in IBM shares weighed on the Dow.  * Copper prices fell on Wednesday on concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve could further cut monetary stimulus next week, but declines were limited by tight short-term availability of metal in the physical market.  * Iron ore fell to its weakest level in more than six months amid slow demand from top importer China. Prices, which have already lost 8 percent this month, are at risk of sliding further.  * Gold prices fell, extending the previous session's one-percent pullback, hurt by technical weakness and strength in the dollar and U.S. equities.  * Santos Ltd <STO.AX> will release its quarterly activities report later in the day.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2132 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1844.86  0.06% 1.060 USD/JPY <JPY=>   104.510.2% 0.210 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.8619  -- 0.039 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1236.44 -0.38%-4.670 US CRUDE<CLc1>   96.631.75% 1.660 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16373.34-0.25%-41.10 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  147.70   0.65%  0.95 ------------------------------------------------------------- * S&P 500 ends flat; IBM weighs on Dow[.N]   * Oil rises on Gulf Coast pipeline start, heating demand [O/R]   * Gold eases on technical weakness, dollar; Fed eyed[GOL/]   * Copper dips on worries Fed could taper next week [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB]   (Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471  4234) DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
