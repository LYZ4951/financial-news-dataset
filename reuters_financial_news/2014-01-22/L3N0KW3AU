MUMBAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - India's benchmark index rose 0.4 percent to a record closing high on Wednesday, gaining for a third consecutive session as drug makers such as Sun Pharmaceutical rallied on optimism about their quarterly earnings.

Gains among drug makers helped offset a fall in some banking shares after a central bank panel recommended making taming high retail inflation a priority for monetary policy, raising the prospect of a sustained period of high interest rates. [ID:nL3N0KW167] Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd <SUN.NS> rose 3 percent, but State Bank of India <SBI.NS> fell 0.8 percent. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally gained 0.41 percent to 21,337.67 points, surpassing its previous record close of 21,326.42 hit on Dec. 9. The index remains below its all-time high of 21,483.74 points hit on that day.
