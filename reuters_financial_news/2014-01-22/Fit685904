Jan 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned China Orient Asset Management Corporation's (COAM; A-/Stable) CNY2.5bn 4.10% senior unsecured notes due 2017 a final rating of 'A-'. The notes, issued by Starway Assets Enterprises Inc., are unconditionally and  irrevocably guaranteed by China Orient Asset Management (International) Holding  Limited (COAMI), a wholly owned subsidiary of COAM. In place of a guarantee, COAM has granted a keepwell deed and a deed of equity  interest purchase and investment undertaking to ensure that the guarantor,  COAMI, has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations under the  guarantee for the notes. The 'A-' rating on the offshore bond is in line with the ratings of COAM, given  the strong link between COAMI and COAM and the keepwell deed and the deed of  equity interest purchase and investment undertaking, which provide additional  support and which transfer the ultimate responsibility of payment to COAM. In Fitch's opinion, the deeds signal a strong intention from COAM to ensure that  COAMI has sufficient funds to honour the debt obligations. The agency also  believes COAMI intends to maintain its reputation and credit profile in the  international offshore market. Additionally a default by COAMI could have  significant negative repercussions on COAM for any future offshore funding. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected  rating assigned on 15 January 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS COAM is rated two notches below the China sovereign (A+/Stable), reflecting  ownership by the central government, and strong operational and strategic ties  with the government, resulting in a strong likelihood of extraordinary  government support if needed. COAM's rating also takes into account dilution of  the policy role and expected reduction in shareholding by the government. COAM is therefore classified as a dependent public sector entity under Fitch's  criteria. Despite an anticipated dilution of the government's shareholding,  Fitch expects that the sovereign to continue to play a strong strategic role in  the entity and maintain tight control. The government, through the Ministry of Finance, owns 100% of COAM. The ministry  provided initial capital contribution of CNY10bn and the central bank provided  subsidised loans to establish COAM. In addition, Fitch expects that COAM's  ultimate losses on the purchase and disposal of policy-oriented non-performing  assets (NPA) will be borne by the finance ministry. COAM has no board of directors and its major strategic decisions are made by the  finance ministry. Daily operations are managed by a president, along with eight  other managers appointed by the China Banking Regulation Commission (CBRC),  which regulates COAM's asset management activities. The management is required  to report on operational and financial conditions on a regular basis to the  finance ministry and CBRC, and submit annual operational and financial results  to the ministry. In the past five years, COAM has rapidly diversified its business, including  into insurance, securities, trust and finance leasing. Although the  diversification of business lines can smooth out the volatility in profit and  make use of COAM's extensive client base and network, execution risk also rises  along with the fast expansion. Concentration risk arises from COAM's exposure to the Chinese property market,  representing around 78% of its accounts and loan receivables portfolio at the  end of 2012. However, one mitigating factor is most of its outstanding portfolio  is either guaranteed by a third party or secured by assets with loan to value  ratio at less than 40%. COAM is mainly funded by short-term borrowings while the maturity of its NPA  portfolio may be extended. Nevertheless, the large outstanding credit facilities  as well as its good long-term relationships with various banks and financial  institutions to some extent mitigate the risks arising from mismatched assets  and liabilities.COAM is one of four asset management companies owned by the Ministry of Finance  that it established to preserve state-owned assets, prevent and defuse financial  risks and promote reforms of state-owned entities. The four state-owned asset  management companies are also the premium wholesalers for NPA under a policy  that grants them privileges in transferring bulk NPAs and acquiring NPAs across  different regions in China.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would stem from a similar change in the ratings of the  sovereign and/or stronger explicit and implicit support from government. Material changes to its strategic importance to the government or a dilution in  the government shareholding to less than 51% could result in the entity no  longer being classified as a dependent public sector entity and therefore no  longer credit-linked to the sovereign rating, which may result in ratings  downgrade.
