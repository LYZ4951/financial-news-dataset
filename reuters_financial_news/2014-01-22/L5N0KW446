PARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Pan-European financial market operator Euronext aims to get regulators' backing for its spin-off from NYSE Euronext this or next month, its CEO said on Wednesday.

Euronext is due to be spun off in a 1 to 1.5 billion-euro ($1.4-$2.0 billion) listing after Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) merged with New York Stock Exchange parent NYSE Euronext in November. Euronext Chief Executive Dominique Cerutti said that first they needed clearance from regulators in Belgium, Britain, France, Portugal and the Netherlands, countries where the company operates exchanges.
