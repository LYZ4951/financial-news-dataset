OTTAWA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz on Wednesday said the chances of a rate cut were slightly greater than they had been before, but added that the central bank was maintaining a balanced approach.

Earlier in the day, the BoC - which has kept rates at near record lows since September 2010 - said in its Monetary Policy Report that the timing and the direction of the next rate change would depend on economic data.
