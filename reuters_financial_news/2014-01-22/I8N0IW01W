MUMBAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - It is a little premature for India to consider consumer price index (CPI) inflation as the nominal anchor for monetary policy, said Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram on Wednesday.

CPI inflation measure has a lot of imperfections and inflation targeting may be difficult in India, Mayaram told on ET Now television channel. The Reserve Bank of India released a report late on Tuesday proposing inflation to be its main objective with CPI as the nominal anchor.
