FRANKFURT, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> is guiding investors that it will likely price its capital hike in a range of 28.00 to 29.50 euros a share, a source familiar with the transaction told Reuters on Wednesday.

That marks a discount of up to 6.4 percent compared with Tuesday's closing price of 29.90 euros. The stock was trading up 4.7 percent at 31.29 euros by 0846 GMT. Raiffeisen said late on Tuesday that it is aiming for a 50 percent boost to its share capital through the sale of 97.5 million new shares to investors and existing shareholders. [ID:nL5N0KV3HQ]
