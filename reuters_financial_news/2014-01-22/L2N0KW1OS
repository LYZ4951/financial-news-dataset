NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Loral Space & Communications Inc <LORL.O>, which holds a majority stake in Canadian satellite communication services company Telesat Holdings Inc, is exploring a sale, according to several people familiar with the matter.

Loral, whose biggest shareholder is hedge fund veteran Mark Rachesky's MHR Fund Management LLC, is working with Credit Suisse Group AG <CSGN.VX> as it prepares to market itself to potential buyers, the people said. At the same time, Loral is talking to another Telesat shareholder, Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP), about the possibility of jointly selling Telesat, one of the people said. There is no agreement currently between Loral and PSP about a joint sale of Telesat, the people said. A buyer seeking control of Telesat would need PSP's agreement. The Canadian pension fund manager is being advised by Morgan Stanley <MS.N> on options for its stake in Telesat, the person added.   Loral, which has a market value of around $2.4 billion, draws the bulk of its value from its holding in Telesat, the world's fourth largest provider of fixed satellite services.
