COPENHAGEN, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Denmark should block the planned sale of Nets Holding, Europe's second biggest payment services company, and instead nationalise the firm, a lobby group representing 1,300 of the country's grocery stores said on Wednesday.

Nets, which in 2012 handled more than 2.2 billion Nordic payment card transactions, or about one third of the total, was put up for sale last year with a potential price tag of up to 2 billion euros ($2.71 billion). [ID:nL5N0KP3G9] "The federation of grocers suggests the government, via the central bank, takes over Nets," the interest group said in a statement, and pointed to a clause in the Danish constitution that says only the state can produce currency. Nets is particularly dominant in Denmark, where its Dankort brand handled more than one billion transactions last year and is regarded by many users as a substitute for carrying cash. Earlier this week the system was hit by computer problems and Danes who are used to paying for everything from chewing gum to petrol with their card, were unable to buy anything for most of the day. Grocers have also expressed fears that the cost of using Nets' services could rise if the firm is sold. The top owners of Nets are commercial banks Nordea <NDA.ST><NDA.CO> with 21 percent and DNB <DNB.OL> with 18.2 percent. The Danish central bank holds 9.9 percent, and a range of other private banks also hold stakes. JP Morgan has been hired to administer the sale, and several private equity firms and one trade buyer have made it through to the next round of an auction, banking sources recently told Reuters.  The grocers' federation urged members of the Danish Parliament to consider whether they want "today's coin" to be controlled by private equity companies. The central bank has previously made it clear it doesn't want to continue ownership.
