SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn lashed out against Apple Inc <AAPL.O> again on Wednesday, saying the iPhone maker was doing shareholders a "great disservice" by refusing to sharply increase its share buyback program.

The billionaire, who has urged Apple repeatedly to return more cash to shareholders, tweeted that he had bought $500 million more shares in the company in just the past two weeks, bringing his total investment to more than $3 billion.
