FRANKFURT, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Allianz <ALVG.DE> shares slipped 1.9 percent on Wednesday, lagging a flat sector index <.SXIP>, following news that the star chief executive of its Pimco asset management unit, Mohamed El-Erian, is to step down from the post.

Neither the company, which announced the changes late on Tuesday, nor El-Erian gave a reason for the departure, schedule for mid-March. El-Erian was seen as heir apparent to Pimco co-founder Bill Gross. [ID:nL2N0KV1P6] Customers withdrew $41.1 billion of money from Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund last year, a record amount for the $2 trillion manager, according to investment research firm Morningstar. "Things don't appear to be going that well," one trader said, citing the high outflows. "The departure is an irritant and everything together is bound to chip away a bit at the share price," he said.
