MADRID, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday it will place 5 percent of Spanish drug maker Almirall <ALM.MC>, currently held by Grupo Plafin, through an accelerated book building process.

The private placement of some 8.7 million shares will be made to institutional investors, the U.S. investor said in a statement to Spain's stock market regulator.
