HANOI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> was down 0.19 percent at the break on Wednesday as investors took profit from blue chips that gained strongly over the past few weeks.    Steel producer Hoa Phat Group <HPG.HM> plummeted 6.48 percent, food producer Ma San Group <MSN.HM> dropped 2.59 percent and real estate firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> fell 0.63 percent.

Gains in some other blue chips stemmed the fall, including top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM>, which rose 1.69 percent.  Property firm Tan Tao Investment and Industry Corp <ITA.HM> surged 4.29 percent, extending a strong rise in the previous session.  According to analyst Vu Tran Vinh Thuy of Dai Viet Securities, ITA's rise was due to news it would this month be added to the VN30 Index, which features the biggest stocks and best performers on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange.
