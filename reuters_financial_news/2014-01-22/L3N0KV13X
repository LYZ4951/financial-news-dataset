HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - HK Electric Investments Ltd <2638.HK>, the investment trust controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing's Power Assets Holdings Ltd <0006.HK>, raised $3.11 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering, pricing the deal at the bottom of expectations.

The trust priced the IPO at HK$5.45 per unit, compared with a marketing range of HK$5.45 to HK$6.30 each, Power Assets said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. HK Electric Investments offered 4.43 billion units for sale. That valued the deal at about HK$24.14 billion ($3.11 billion), well below the $5.7 billion it was once seen raising.
