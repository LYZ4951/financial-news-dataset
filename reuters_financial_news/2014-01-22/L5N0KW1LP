DUBAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - National Bank of Kuwait <NBKK.KW>, the Gulf Arab state's largest commercial lender, widely missed analyst expectations as it posted a 48 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profit, Reuters calculated.

Net profit was $142 million in the three months to the end of December, compared to $273 million in the same period a year ago, Reuters calculated based on financial statements. Three analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted 80.14 million dinars ($283.2 million) net profit on average. [ID:nL6N0KG05X] NBK reported a full-year profit for 2013 at $844 million, down from the $1.08 billion recorded for 2012, a statement from the bank said on Wednesday.
