TAIPEI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to expand mobile payment this year to physical retail shops and allow multi-currency payment, a move to assist domestic e-commerce players to seize overseas business opportunities, according to local media reports.

The Economic Daily said on Wednesday the financial regulator would also start studying in June whether to open up payment transfers between online accounts.
