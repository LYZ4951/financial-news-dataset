ROME, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Italy could raise as much as 6 billion euros ($8.13 billion) to lower the European Union's second-biggest debt in the planned sale of up to 40 percent of the national post office service, a government source said on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Enrico Letta's government will likely examine a bill on the privatisation of national post office service Poste Italiane [PSTIT.UL] on Friday afternoon at a cabinet meeting, other government sources said. The sale is expected to place by June or July.
