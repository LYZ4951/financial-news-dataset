SINGAPORE, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd <SGXL.SI> reported net profit of S$75 million ($58.58 million) in the December quarter, its weakest in more than a year after a penny stock scandal hammered trading volumes.

That came in line with the S$75.2 million average forecast of eight analysts surveyed by Reuters, and down 1.8 percent from a year ago. [ID:nSNbkc7Mr] Derivatives revenue rose 16 percent to S$52.5 million and was a shade higher than securities revenue which fell 13 percent to S$52.2 million.  Since taking over as CEO four years ago, Magnus Bocker has spearheaded the launch of new financial and commodity derivatives to make Singapore a regional gateway in Asia.
