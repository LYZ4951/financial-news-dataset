LJUBLJANA, Jan 22 (Reuters) -    Position: Slovenian finance minister

Incumbent: Uros Cufer  Year of Birth: 1970   Term: Took office on March 20, 2013; Election due by late 2015  Key facts:  -- Independent ministerial candidate supported by Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek's liberal Pozitivna Slovenija (Positive Slovenia) party. While having little political experience, Cufer is a veteran of the banking business, having worked at the Slovenian central bank and then the top local lender, Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB), from 1999-2013.  -- In 1989, he moved with parents to Paris where he graduated and later defended a doctoral thesis entitled "Monetary Policy in Slovenia". He chose to return to Slovenia where he was appointed to head the research department in the central bank from 1999 to 2004.  -- In 2004 moved to NLB, where he worked as head of the bank's financial management and on the bank's restructuring programme. NLB is among the lenders that received state aid to avoid bankruptcy in December, but Cufer was never singled out as a person responsible for the bank's lending policies and a huge level of bad loans.  -- Experts say Cufer's experience in the banking sector is an asset for his efforts to consolidate the sector but caution he will need a firm backing from within the ruling coalition for his second task, fiscal consolidation.
