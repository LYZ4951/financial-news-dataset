Jan 22 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1100 GMT on Wednesday:

** Swedish steelmaker SSAB AB <SSABa.ST> has agreed to buy Finnish rival Rautaruukki Corp <RTRKS.HE> in an all-share deal worth 10.1 billion Swedish crowns ($1.6 billion) as weak demand forces Europe's smaller players to cut costs and deal with overcapacity. [ID:nL5N0KW0B0]  ** Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd <DBSM.SI> is in advanced talks to buy Societe Generale's <SOGN.PA> Asian private bank, a deal that would help boost its private banking assets by almost a third, sources familiar with the matter said. It was unclear how much Southeast Asia's biggest lender would be willing to pay for the bank, but previous estimates from financial sources have valued it at between $300 million and $400 million. [ID:nL3N0KW1ON]  ** Credit Agricole SA <CAGR.PA> said it had agreed to sell its Bulgarian division to Bulgarian bank Corporate Commercial Bank AD <6C9.BB> for an undisclosed sum. [ID:nL5N0KW164]  ** A 23.5 percent stake in Russian truckmaker Kamaz OAO <KMAZ.MM> may be sold to Russian buyers rather than its partner Daimler AG <DAIGn.DE>, because the German carmaker is not offering a high enough price, Kommersant newspaper reported. [ID:nL2N0KW09D]  ** Canada's Saputo Inc <SAP.TO> said it has secured majority control of Australia's Warrnambool Cheese and Butter Factory Co Holdings Ltd <WCB.AX>, putting pressure on rival bidder Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co to concede defeat. Saputo said it had increased its shareholding in Australia's oldest dairy maker to 52.7 percent. [ID:nL3N0KV529]  ** The foundation that controls Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> has received no offer for its 33.5 stake in the lender from other Italian banking foundations, its head told Italian newspaper La Stampa. [ID:nL5N0KW0LP]  ** Filipino tycoon Lucio Tan's holding firm LT Group Inc <LTG.PS> has increased its stake in Philippine National Bank <PNB.PS> to 59.88 percent from 48.61 percent by subscribing to an ongoing stock rights offering, Malaya Business Insight reported on Tuesday. [ID:nL3N0KW02J]  ** The group of Filipino businessman Roberto Ongpin has increased its interest in Alphaland Corp <ALPHA.PS> to a majority stake following a capital call, thereby diluting the stake of British fund Ashmore, previously the single largest shareholder of the Philippine property firm, the Philippine Star reported. [ID:nL3N0KW01L]  ** BlackBerry Ltd <BBRY.O> <BB.TO> said on Tuesday that it intends to divest the majority of its real estate holdings in Canada as it seeks to bolster its balance sheet and turn around its fortunes.
