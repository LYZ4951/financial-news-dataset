MUMBAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - India's central bank will release its report on macroeconomic and monetary developments for the October-December quarter along with the monetary policy review on Jan. 28, it said in a statement on Wednesday.

This is a departure from its previous practice of releasing the macroeconomic report one day prior to the quarterly monetary policy review.
