LJUBLJANA, Jan 22 (Reuters) -    Position: Slovenian prime minister

Incumbent: Alenka Bratusek  Date of Birth: March 31, 1970  Term: Confirmed as PM in parliament on March 20, 2013; Election due by late 2015  Key facts:  -- Bratusek formed a four-party centre-left coalition government at a time when the euro zone member country faced a deep economic crisis, mostly due to a huge level of bad loans in local banks. She vowed to save the banks, reform the stifled economy without international aid and rebuild the country's international credibility.  -- She became leader of the liberal Pozitivna Slovenija (Positive Slovenia) party in January 2013, succeeding the party's founder and current mayor of the capital Ljubljana, Zoran Jankovic.   -- Despite being relatively inexperienced Bratusek kept her ruling bloc together and survived a non-confidence vote in November 2013, winning support for her measures to fix the budget and avoid an international bailout. After that her government pumped in 3.2 billion euros into the banks and started clearing their bad loans. -- She sees privatisation of a dozen major firms, including banks, telecom and transport sectors, as a necessary step towards their better management and sustainability of public finances.  -- Bratusek graduated from the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology and then obtained a master's degree in management of non-profit organisations from the Faculty of Political Sciences in 2006.  -- Joined the finance ministry in 1999 and in the following years worked mostly on budget matters on both national and municipal levels.Keywords: LEADER/SLOVENIA
