HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - China shares extended a rebound from six-month lows on Wednesday, outshining most other Asian markets, as cash rates in the mainland eased further after the Chinese central bank offered funds earlier this week to ease a cash squeeze.

At 0255 GMT, the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was up 2.2 percent at 2,235.1 points -- its highest intra-day level in two weeks. It had ended on Monday at its lowest since July 9. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> rose 1.8 percent. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore listings in Hong Kong was up 0.9 percent, while the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> gained 0.3 percent.
