LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> said on Monday it was putting more money aside to deal with the mis-selling of loan insurance in Britain, joining other banks that have raised provisions to more than 22 billion pounds ($36.8 billion) in total.

Compensation for customers who bought payment protection insurance (PPI) is the costliest mis-selling scandal in British banking history. PPI policies were supposed to protect borrowers against sickness or redundancy, but were often sold to those who would have been ineligible to claim. Lloyds <LLOY.L>, Barclays <BARC.L> and Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> all increased provisions for PPI at recent half-year results, partly due to a jump in claims from policies taken out before 2005. That is forcing banks to set aside extra cash to cover payouts and rising administration costs.  NAB, which owns mid-sized lenders Clydesdale and Yorkshire, said on Monday it had raised its PPI provision by 75 million pounds to cover extra administration costs. [ID:nL4N0QN0QN] The bank said "significant" additional costs were likely for customer payouts and a possible fine related to errors in its previous complaints handling process. NAB also set aside 170 million pounds to compensate small firms mis-sold risky products designed to insure them against rising interest rates. Major lenders have now put aside more than 4.4 billion pounds ($7.4 billion) for that issue, although they had only paid out 1.2 billion pounds by the end of June.
