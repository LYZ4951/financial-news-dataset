NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest since January as labor market conditions improved, data from the National Association of Home Builders showed on Monday.

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index rose to 55 in August from 53 in July, the group said in a statement. It was the third straight monthly gain, and topped the mean estimate of analysts polled by Reuters for a reading of 53.  Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable. "Each of the three components of the HMI registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring," said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe. "Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand."
