BEIJING, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities dropped 0.9 percent in July from June, a third consecutive monthly drop following June's drop of 0.5 percent, according to Reuters calculations from official data published on Monday.

Compared with a year ago, home prices were up 2.5 percent in July, easing from the previous month's 4.2 percent rise, according to Reuters calculations. After a strong performance in 2013, China's real estate market has softened as sales have slowed and banks have become increasingly cautious about lending to developers and home-buyers. The National Bureau of Statistics said new home prices in Beijing rose 4.0 percent in July compared with a year earlier, compared with June's increase of 6.4 percent. They dropped 1.0 percent from June.
