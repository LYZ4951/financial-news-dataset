SHANGHAI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares ended flat on Monday, dampened by weakness in the property and financial sectors after China released weak home prices and foreign direct investment (FDI) data.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> finished flat at 24,955.46 points. It hit its highest closing level since Nov. 8, 2010 last Friday.  The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong declined 0.4 percent for the day. Sun Hung Properties <0016.HK> fell 0.7 and Bank of China <3988.HK> was down near 0.5 percent. Lenovo Group <0992.HK> limited the market's fall after it climbed to a 14-year high on news the U.S. regulators passed a deal allowing it to take over IBM's low-end server division.
