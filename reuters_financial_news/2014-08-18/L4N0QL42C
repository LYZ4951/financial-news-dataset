Aug 18 (Reuters) - British insurer Amlin Plc <AML.L> reported an 8 percent decline in first-half pretax profit, hurt by large catastrophe losses and adverse foreign exchange translations.

The company, Lloyd's of London's largest listed British underwriter, said its estimated net exposure to the Malaysian Airlines <MASM.KL> MH17 disaster and Tripoli Airport fire was less than 25 million pounds ($41 million). [ID:nRSR3327Pa]
