Aug 18 (Reuters) - There is an even 50 percent chance that the European Central Bank will resort to asset purchases to boost inflation in the coming year, a Reuters poll of euro money market traders found on Monday.

Economic growth in the euro zone was flat in the second quarter, with two of its biggest economies - Germany and Italy - contracting, while inflation fell to just 0.4 percent in July, well below the bank's target. Both sets of data suggest a need for more central bank support. The ECB in June announced more long-term cheap loans with a condition that banks use this cash to lend to the real economy but traders, economists and market watchers polled by Reuters do not expect them to be enough. [ID:nL6N0PE3W1] [ID:nL4N0Q32M0] [ID:nL5N0OR41N] As a result, traders in the latest Reuters poll gave a 50 percent chance the ECB would conduct an outright quantitative easing program in addition to the Targeted Long-term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). That is higher than the one-in-three chance given by economists in a Reuters poll last week. [ID:nL4N0QI4PQ] Back in 2011 and 2012, the ECB flushed the money market with over a trillion euros to avert a credit crunch at the peak of the sovereign debt crisis. Banks, which have already repaid over half of those crisis loans early, are expected to return another 3.5 billion euros next week, more than the 2.9 billion euros they will pay back this week. [ID:nZYN2D8R00] The regular poll showed banks will borrow 105.0 billion euros at the ECB's weekly refinancing tender, slightly less than the 108.2 billion euros maturing this week.
