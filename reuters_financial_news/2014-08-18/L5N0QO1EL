MOSCOW, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Russia's top mobile phone operator MTS <MTSS.MM> <MBT.N> is expected to post a 40 percent year-on-year fall in second-quarter net profit after a one-off gain a year ago, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

The average of forecasts from 15 banks and brokerages was for a net profit of 17.5 billion roubles ($485.3 million). The forecast was down from 29 billion roubles last year when MTS booked a $320 million gain related to the settlement of a dispute in former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan.

They expected the company to perform well in Russia but consolidated sales growth was expected to be held back by the devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia against the rouble. After Russia, MTS's second-biggest market is Ukraine, where it gets revenues in hryvnias but reports consolidated results in roubles. Both Russian and Ukrainian currencies weakened because of the ongoing Ukraine crisis but the fall of the hryvnia has been more pronounced, hitting sales figures. "The results should confirm MTS's fairly strong positions and cash generating ability in Russia, which is its core market; however, operations in Ukraine are under pressure. The macro economic situation in Russia and developments in Ukraine will remain the key risks," Uralsib said in a preview note.
