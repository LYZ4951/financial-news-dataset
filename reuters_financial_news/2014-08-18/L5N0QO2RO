LAGOS, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Pan-African lender Ecobank <ETI.LG> <EBG.GH> expects South Africa's Nedbank <NEDJ.J> to convert a $285 million loan to shares in Ecobank before the end of the year, Ecobank's chief executive said on Monday.

Albert Essien said he was confident Nedbank would exercise the conversion option and also top up the conversion amount with $206 million to give it a 20 percent stake in Ecobank.
