BANGKOK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Thai shares gained modestly on Monday after second-quarter GDP growth helped the domestic economy avoid a technical recession, while Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation <OCBC.SI> underperformed the Singapore market after the bank announced a rights issue.

Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> edged up 0.04 percent as investors bought banking stocks such as Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> and Kasikornbank <KBANK.BK> ahead of interim dividend announcements later this month. Thailand's economy expanded 0.9 percent in April-June from the previous three months, avoiding a technical recession, and grew 0.4 percent from a year earlier, the planning agency said. [ID:nL4N0QO1CD] Investors focussed on the ruling military council's discussion of the 2015 fiscal budget plan on Monday and formation of an interim government seen later this month. "Market momentum is likely to remain positive this week with further upside, driven by optimism over the fiscal budget and the next prime minister," strategists at broker Krungsri Securities wrote in a report. Singapore's Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> was down 0.37 percent, with shares of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp falling as much as 1.4 percent to an over one-week low.
