DUBAI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Shareholders of National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah <RAKB.AD> (RAKBANK) have approved a 3.64-dirham ($0.99) per share offer to buy a majority stake in Ras Al Khaimah National Insurance Co <RAKN.AD>, the bank said on Monday.

RAKBANK's proposed price is slightly below RAK insurance's closing price on Aug. 17 of 3.7 dirhams. The stock has not traded on Monday.
