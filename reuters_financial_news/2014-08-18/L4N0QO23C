SEOUL, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> hit a 5-week intraday high on Monday, as exporters sold dollars after stock markets around the world showed resilience to the latest tensions in Ukraine.

The won ended local trade at 1,017.6 per dollar after hitting a session high of 1,015.5, its strongest since July 11, compared with Thursday's domestic close <KRW=KFTC> of 1,021.2. South Korean financial markets were closed on Friday for a public holiday.
