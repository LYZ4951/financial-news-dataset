SYDNEY, Aug 19 (Reuters) - QBE Insurance Group <QBE.AX>, Australia's biggest insurer by premium income, on Tuesday posted a 18 percent drop in first-half net profit compared with a year ago, hit by higher-than-expected claims in overseas markets.

QBE said its net profit after tax for the six months ended June 30 was $392 million, in line with a profit warning issued last month, and down from $477 million a year ago. The company also announced a $750 million share placement primarily to cancel $500 million of convertible subordinated debt.
