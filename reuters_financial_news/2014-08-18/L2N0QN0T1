Aug 18 (Reuters) - Private equity firms The Blackstone Group LP <BX.N> and TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL] are close to buying subprime mortgage lender, Kensington, Britain's Sky News reported on Sunday.

Sky News said the sale of Kensington, owned by Anglo-South African financial services provider Investec <INLJ.J>, had not yet been finalised, but a deal could be announced this week. The television and multimedia news agency said the two firms had lined up a new management team to take charge once the deal is completed. (http://bit.ly/1oGhSi0) Blackstone and TPG are also expected to pump capital into the business, Sky reported.  Investec bought Kensington, which had specialised in lending to home buyers with a poor credit history, in a 283-million-pound ($473.03 million) deal in 2007. [ID:nL5N0LB158]
