MUMBAI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose over 1 percent on Monday to a record high as blue-chips such as ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> surged after Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to fire up the bureaucracy to deliver results, while easing wholesale inflation also helped.

The broader 50-share index <.NSEI> rose as much as 1.14 percent to 7,880.50, surpassing its previous all-time high of 7,840.95 hit on July 25.
