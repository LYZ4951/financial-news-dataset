CAIRO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound remained stable at a central bank dollar sale  and on the black market on Monday.

The central bank said it sold $39.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds per dollar. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed in a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.39 pounds, one market participant said, almost unchanged from Thursday's rate of 7.40 pounds.
