ALMATY, May 15 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan, central Asia's largest economy, plans to use the pension savings of its citizens to improve the liquidity of its banks, which were hard hit by the global financial crisis, National Bank Governor Kairat Kelimbetov told Reuters in an interview.

The country's nine private pension funds were combined in a single state fund in January 2013, by order of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The fund's assets now will be used to support economic growth without raiding the National Fund, which collects windfall oil export revenues and is now worth $73.6 billion. Kelimbetov, appointed last October, said total pension-fund assets managed by the bank now stood at 3.9 trillion tenge ($21.4 billion), which should rise by 500 billion to 600 billion tenge a year. At first, Kelimbetov said, as much as 50 percent of Kazakh pension savings would be put in local banks. That will replenish their liquidity and increase lending, but the main idea is to diversify the economy, which now relies on exports of oil and metals. The central bank aims to introduce the system this year. The banks willing to invest pension assets would be selected at tenders, Kelimbetov said. The main criterion will be whether they will pay interest on the pension savings of inflation plus 1.5 percent. The pension fund cash "will provide so-called long-term liquidity for them at quite acceptable rates," Kelimbetov said. He said he eventually wanted to see a third of pension assets invested in "safe and profitable" instruments abroad. "In a decade, we would like to see 33 percent of pension funds invested in state securities, another 33 percent in banks and 33 percent in foreign assets," he said. Some 10 to 12 percent is invested abroad today, he said. Kazakhstan has 38 banks, but that number may fall to 20 or 22 in the next five years because of mergers and the tighter Basel III standards to be introduced from 2015, Kelimbetov said.DIVERSIFY FOR GROWTH Kazakhstan's gross domestic product grew 6 percent last year, up from 5 percent in 2012. The government and central bank target 6 percent growth again this year. Before the global financial crisis, it had grown 8 percent a year. But Kazakh banks were over-exposed to foreign borrowing and a bloated real estate market when the financial crisis hit. The government was forced to spend $10 billion from the oil fund to steady the economy and bail out several large banks. On Feb. 11, the central bank devalued the tenge 19 percent to support exporters, sustain growth and prevent large-scale speculation in foreign currency. Kelimbetov said he expected no further depreciation, despite sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on Kazakhstan's close trading partner, Russia, for Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine crisis.
