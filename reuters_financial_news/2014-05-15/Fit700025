May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Poste Vita's (BBB+/Negative)  planned subordinated debt issuance a 'BBB(EXP)' expected rating.  The final rating of the subordinated notes is contingent on the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already received.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The proposed subordinated notes will have a five-year term and pay a fixed rate  of interest. The notes rank junior to any senior obligations (including  policyholders' liabilities) and have no interest deferral features (ie  non-payment of a coupon would constitute a default). As such, their rating is  one notch below Poste Vita's Issuer Default Rating, in accordance with Fitch's  notching methodology. The planned issuance has received regulatory approval.  Poste Vita is expected to use the proceeds to fund its expected growth and  reduce dependence on its parent company, Poste Italiane (Poste; BBB+/Negative).  Poste has enhanced Poste Vita's capital position through inter-company  subordinated loans (EUR540m) and two capital injections in July 2013 (EUR200m)  and December 2013 (EUR150m). The issue is expected to be classified as Tier 2 notes for regulatory purposes  and would therefore receive 100% capital credit in Fitch's analysis of Poste  Vita's capital adequacy. The regulatory solvency margin would increase from 122%  at end-2013 (based on consolidated accounts). However, Fitch expects Poste Vita  to manage capital at around 1.2x minimum regulatory requirements as the company  grows its business. Fitch-calculated financial leverage would increase as a result of the issuance  as we would treat the notes as 100% debt in our assessment of leverage.  Fixed-charge coverage would reduce as interest expenses increase, albeit  remaining commensurate with the current rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Any change in the rating of Poste Vita is likely to result in a corresponding  change in the rating of the planned subordinated debt.
