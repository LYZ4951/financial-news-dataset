LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - Alliance Boots[ABN.UL], which runs Europe's largest pharmacy chain, has made more synergies than expected so far with U.S. drugstore chain operator Walgreen Co <WAG.N>, it said, as it reported a 18.5 percent rise in underlying attributable profit.

Alliance Boots, in which Walgreen bought a 45 percent stake in 2012 with an option to buy the rest in 2015, reported sales for the year to March 31 rose 4.3 percent to 23.4 billion pounds ($39.26 billion), with underlying profit of 840 million pounds. "Our joint synergy programme with Walgreens is increasingly providing us with significant financial benefits," Alliance Boots said in a statement. "While still at an early stage, we are pleased with the overall progress of the programme, total synergies achieved to date tracking ahead of target."  Walgreens reported a lower-than-expected profit for the quarter ended Feb. 28 but said it expected a bigger boost this year from its partnership with Alliance Boots. [ID:nL1N0MM0HL]
