May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed India-based Vedanta Resources PLC's <VED.L> (Vedanta) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BB+' on Rating Watch Negative (RWN). The agency has also placed the company's senior unsecured rating of 'BB' on RWN. A full rating breakdown is provided at the end of this commentary. The rating was placed on RWN because Fitch is changing its approach to using  metrics based on a proportional consolidated financial profile, given the  significant minority shareholders at the key operating entities in the group,  which have different debt and cash levels. Fitch previously used metrics based  on the consolidated financial profile of the group.  The ratings may be downgraded by a maximum of one notch following the review.  For the previous sensitivities, see the rating action commentary titled "Fitch  Revises Vedanta's Outlook to Stable; Affirms IDR at 'BB+'" dated 16 May 2013  that used metrics based on the consolidated profile.
