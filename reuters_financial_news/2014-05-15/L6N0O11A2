FRANKFURT, May 15 (Reuters) - Erich Kellerhals, the minority owner and founder of Media-Saturn Holding GmbH, plans to buy back the electronics chain from German retailer Metro <MEOG.DE>, Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in its Thursday edition.

"We have thoroughly calculated and worked everything out," the German newspaper said in comments it attributed to Kellerhals. "Funding is not the issue, particularly since I have interested investors," Kellerhals told the paper.
