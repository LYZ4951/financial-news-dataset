STOCKHOLM, May 15 (Reuters) - Financial markets in Sweden are functioning well and the overall risk level for investors is broadly unchanged from six months ago, a Riksbank survey of market participants showed on Thursday.

"The respondents consider that the overall risk level is unchanged compared to six months ago, but that risks related to emerging economies have increased, at the same time as the risks linked to developments in the euro area have declined," the Riksbank said.
