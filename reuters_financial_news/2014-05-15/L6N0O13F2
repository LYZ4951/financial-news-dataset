WARSAW, May 15 (Reuters) - The controlling shareholders in the Warsaw stock exchange <GPW.WA> are considering removing the bourse's chief executive and replacing him with Poland's Deputy Treasury Minister Pawel Tamborski, several sources close to the shareholders said.

Tamborski, a former head of investment banking in UniCredit's <CRDI.MI> Polish arm and at Wood & Company, declined to comment on the issue. A spokeswoman for the stock exchange said she had no immediate comment, and the treasury ministry was not immediately available to comment. The state-controlled bourse is the biggest stock market in central Europe. Under CEO Adam Maciejewski, talks on a tie-up with the Vienna bourse have dragged on, while the Warsaw exchange faces future challenges attracting new investors. "The treasury wants a markets man on the job to breathe new life into the Warsaw bourse," one of the sources said, on condition of anonymity.   The Warsaw bourse has 450 listed companies - 46 of them foreign - with a combined market capitalisation of around 900 billion zlotys ($294.5 billion). Poland's privatisation programme has generated a steady stream of public offerings on the bourse, attracting new investors. But there are now few state-owned assets left to sell off, leaving the bourse at a crossroads. The tie-up with the Vienna stock exchange, which also owns smaller exchanges in Prague, Budapest and Ljubljana, could strengthen Warsaw's position against its rivals in Frankfurt <DB1Gn.DE> and London <LSE.L>. [ID:nL5N0KQ23L] But talks between Warsaw and Vienna have now been going on for over a year with no sign of an imminent conclusion.  In another challenge to the bourse, a reform of Poland's state-mandated pension system could reduce the appetite for equities among private pension funds.
