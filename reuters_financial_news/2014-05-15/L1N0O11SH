May 15 (Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund managers in the first quarter zoned in on the consumer sector, with investments that included eBay Inc <EBAY.O>, Dollar General Corp <DG.N> and Walgreen Co <WAG.N>.

Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors opened a new stake of 1.7 million shares in discount retailer Dollar General, while Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners increased its stake in drug store operator Walgreen by 4.8 million shares to 12.1 million shares, regulatory filings showed on Thursday. EBay, which became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal payments business, continued to find fans in the first quarter. Omega increased its stake in eBay to 2.9 million shares from 854,800 shares and Jana opened a new stake of 3.9 million shares during the first quarter. The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. And there is also little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges. Upon request, the SEC also permits managers to omit sensitive stock positions from 13F filings. As a result, the public filings don't always present a complete picture of a manager's stock holdings.  Here are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited from in the first quarter.  COCA-COLA ENTERPRISES  Tiger Global Management LLC, led by Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan, slashed its stake in soft drink producer and distributor Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc <CCE.N> by 14.5 percent to 6.7 million shares.JPMORGAN CHASE & CO Omega Advisors increased its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> by 1.6 million shares to 1.7 million shares in the first quarter.

GROUPON INC  Jana Partners increased its stake in Groupon Inc's <GRPN.O> class A shares by 9.8 million shares to 40.8 million class A shares. Chase Coleman and Feroz Dewan's Tiger Global Management got rid of its entire stake in the operator of a "deal-of-the-day" website.   GENERAL MOTORS CO Jana Partners sold nearly all of its stake General Motors Co <GM.N>, cutting its holding by about 8 million shares to just 7,100 shares.
