ZURICH, May 15 (Reuters) - Cartier owner Richemont <CFR.VX> said underlying sales grew 8 percent in April, excluding Japan that raised taxes that month, broadly in line with the forecast-beating 10 percent rise in the year to March and said it would launch a new share buyback programme.

"Richemont announces a new programme to buy-back up to 10 million Richemont 'A' shares through the market over the next three years," the Geneva-based maker of luxury watches and jewellery said in a statement on Thursday. Richemont shares closed at 87.25 Swiss francs on Wednesday.
