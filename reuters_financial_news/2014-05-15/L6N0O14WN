MILAN, May 15 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, Italy's biggest retail bank, said on Thursday he was comfortable with the lender's plan to pay 10 billion euros in dividends over the next four years at a time when other banks are trimming their payouts to boost capital.

Asked by a Goldman Sachs analyst whether he felt Intesa could be the exception and stick to its generous dividend targets, CEO Carlo Messina said: "I see no problems", adding the bank currently had excess capital of 12 billion euros.
