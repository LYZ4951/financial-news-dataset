DUBAI, May 15 (Reuters) - Dubai and Qatar's bourses fell on Thursday as investors booked profits in many stocks including those that MSCI picked to be part of its emerging market index.

Dubai's benchmark <.DFMGI> dropped 2.6 percent, largely due to Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> and Dubai Islamic Bank <DISB.DU> which fell 4.1 and 4 percent respectively. Index compiler MSCI late Wednesday said both companies would be among those moving to its emerging market benchmark from the frontier market index at the end of May. Emaar's inclusion had appeared certain to investors, while analysts were confident Dubai Investment Bank would also make the cut after the lender increased its foreign ownership limit last December to 25 percent of its shares from 15 percent. "It was not a big surprise," Sebastien Henin, head of asset management at The National Investor, said, referring to the MSCI announcement. Dubai's index, up 54 percent this year, is likely to remain volatile in the coming weeks he said, as two camps take turns dominating the market. "You have some investors who are looking to book profits after the strong rally this year and you have foreigners looking to buy because of the MSCI upgrade," Henin said. "We will have these erratic moves in the market." Abu Dhabi's bourse <.ADI> rose 0.1 percent. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank <ADCB.AD> and National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, both on the MSCI upgrade list, were among the main supports with gains of 1.2 and 0.7 percent respectively. Dana Gas <DANA.AD> fell 4.4 percent after it reported a 32 percent drop in first-quarter profit. [ID:nL6N0O11A6]  QATAR, EGYPT Qatar's heavyweights stocks fell, dragging Doha's index <.QSI> 0.4 percent lower. Qatar National Bank <QNBK.QA> slid 2.6 percent, Industries Qatar <IQCD.QA> dropped 1 percent and Ooredoo <ORDS.QA> eased 1.4 percent.  Smaller companies fared better: Vodafone Qatar <VFQS.QA> added 1.2 percent, topping daily traded value, while Islamic bank Masraf Al Rayan <MARK.QA> gained 1.6 percent and Barwa Real Estate <BRES.QA> rose 1.4 percent. All six will join MSCI's emerging market index. Egypt's bourse <.EGX30> was Thursday's top performer, rising 1 percent to 8,553 points. It faces resistance at 8,597, the March intra-day peak. Talaat Moustafa <TMGH.CA> and Ezz Steel <ESRS.CA>, both of which buoyed the market on Wednesday after posting strong quarterly results, remained among the key supports, climbing 2.7 and 5.1 percent respectively. Shares in Egypt Kuwait Holding Co <EKHO.CA> rose 4.6 percent after it reported a 15-percent jump in first-quarter profit.
