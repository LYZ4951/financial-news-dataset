LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - UK discount retailer B&M is poised to announce its plans for a London listing next week in a deal which could be worth at least 2 billion pounds ($3.4 billion), several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The company, which sells everything from greenhouses to trampolines, has been owned by US private equity fund Clayton Dubilier & Rice since 2012. The listing is being run by Goldman Sachs <GS.N> and Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>.   B&M declined to comment.  ($1 = 0.5960 British Pounds)
