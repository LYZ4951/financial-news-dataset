OSLO, May 15 (Reuters) - The finance committee of Norway's parliament held a hearing on monetary policy on Thursday. In connection with his appearance, central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen made the following remarks to the committee and to journalists:

ON THE DEBT SITUATION AND THE HOUSING MARKET "Housing prices have levelled out, and we now see better chances of a soft landing in the Norwegian economy. Even though housing prices have increased a few months in a row, I do not think this changes that picture, so far. That is why the central bank now for a short period is a little less concerned about the housing market. "Household debt is at a historically high level, but households are careful and saving has increased. If this behaviour should change, there would be more reason to be worried about their vulnerability."  ON THE ECONOMY "The main view of the Norwegian economy is that it is solid. We have a fantastic motor in the petroleum sector, and even though activity is levelling out, it is hard to be pessimistic about the Norwegian economy, unless the oil price should drop dramatically."  ON THE CURRENCY "The level of the Norwegian crown is a very important factor, especially in relation to the inflation target, but we have no specific target for the currency, or a view on what constitutes a reasonable level."  ON THE REVISED NATIONAL BUDGET "Seen in isolation, the revised budget does not change our view of the fiscal policy substantially, even though it is a little more expansive. "The general outlook for the Norwegian economy is very much like what we saw in March, even with the effects of the revised budget."  ON LOWER BANK RATES "Banks have lowered mortgage rates more than we estimated in the last monetary policy report.
