May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned China Resources  Land Ltd's <1109.HK> (CR Land; BBB+/Stable) USD350m 4.375% senior unsecured notes a final  'BBB+' rating. The notes will be issued under its USD2bn medium-term note  programme and will be consolidated with the USD450m 4.375% notes due 2019 issued  on 27 February 2014 to form a single series.  The notes are rated at the same level as CR Land's senior unsecured rating  because they constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations  of the company. The final ratings are in line with the expected ratings assigned  on 8 May 2014 and follow the receipt of final documents conforming to  information already received. CR Land's ratings are supported by its business model of maximising operating  cash flow from its development properties to support the expansion of its  investment property portfolio. CR Land enters major Tier-2 cities in China  selectively, in line with its model of operating investment properties in prime  locations nationwide. CR Land's strategy fits into its parent China Resources  (Holdings) Company Limited's (CRH) aim to be an influential conglomerate that  taps China's growing affluence.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Cash from Development: Fitch expects CR Land to generate positive cash  flow from operations (CFO) as the company shifts its development property  strategy to focus on stability and profitability instead of high growth. CR Land  generated HKD16.2bn in CFO in 2013, continuing the positive trend set in 2012  and reversing from 2011's negative CFO.  CR Land's contracted sales had a 44% compounded annual growth rate for 2010 to  2013, but the company aims to move towards maximising cash generation with  projects in higher-tier cities or in city centres that enjoy both strong demand  and firm pricing. This is reflected in the higher land cost of CNY3,914 per  square metre (sqm) for new land acquired from the beginning of 2013 to the end  of February 2014, compared with CNY2,283 per sqm for land acquired between 2010  and 2012. High-Yielding Investment Properties: CR Land's investment properties are in  prime locations in China's Tier 1 and wealthier Tier 2 cities. CR Land maintains  an 80/20 split between retail and office by rental income. The strength of this  portfolio is seen in the net rental yield of 5.5% that it fetched in 2013,  higher than the average of 3.5% among large Hong Kong and Chinese property  investment companies. CR Land's strong reputation in investment properties helps  to support sales of its development properties that are linked to its investment  property projects. Parental Assistance: CR Land's business profile is strengthened by the  operational benefits it enjoys as a core subsidiary of CRH. CRH supports CR Land  in preparing prime land and large parcel lands for eventual injection into CR  Land for development. These additional land parcels augment CR Land's own  existing land bank. CR Land has an edge in securing prime land in new cities  given state-owned CRH's government linkage as well as its proven track record in  developing city centre commercial property projects. CR Land also enjoys lower  funding costs from borrowings with affiliated companies. Financial Headroom Supports Expansion: Fitch has focused on investment property  credit metrics in its analysis as CR Land's development property business is  moving into a stable state. The agency allocates all cash and debt supporting  30% of properties under development (net of presales proceeds) to the  development business, in line with the trends for large Chinese homebuilders.  Residual debt is then allocated to the investment business. With this  adjustment, the key measure used to assess CR Land's development business is the  churn rate as measured by contracted sales/ gross debt of the development  business. This ratio has been improving, rising to 1.4x in 2013 from 1.2x in  2012 and 1.0x in 2011. For its investment property business segment, leverage, as measured by net  debt/recurring EBITDA, stood at 1.0x at end-2013 and EBIT net interest cover  (NIC) was 3.8x after adjusting for a development business churn rate of 1.8x.  These ratios are comparable to similarly or higher rated Hong Kong property  investment companies. CR Land is making heavy investments that will more than  double its investment property assets over the next three years. As a result, CR  Land's credit metrics are likely to weaken, although they would still remain  healthy with EBIT NIC for investment property trending towards 3.0x and leverage  heading towards 7.0x. Rapid Expansion Constrains Ratings: CR Land's high capex is partly debt funded  and the resulting higher leverage is a rating concern. Fitch expects CR Land to  open an average of seven new investment property projects or an equivalent GFA  of almost 900,000 sqm per year between 2014 and 2016. This compares with its  existing GFA of 2.3m sqm as of end 2013. The agency projects that a constant  increase of more than 20% in newly added GFA will create pressure on CR Land's  credit metrics.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Positive rating action is unlikely in the next 12 to 18 months but  stabilisation of the investment property operation at a substantially larger  scale may lead to positive rating action.  Negative: Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - investment property debt/recurring EBITDA sustained above 7.0x; - investment property EBIT NIC sustained below 2.5x; - contracted sales/development properties gross debt sustained below 1.8x;
