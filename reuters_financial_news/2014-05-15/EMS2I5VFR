NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended May 14 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $4.1 billion to $1.038 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $13.2 billion to $1.107 trillion.
