MILAN, May 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's Generali <GASI.MI> opened up 1.6 percent on Thursday after the insurer released better than expected first-quarter results.

The Trieste-based group also said it entered exclusive talks with Latin America's Banco BTG Pactual to sell its Swiss unit Banca della Svizzera Italiana.  "Q1 results are slightly better than expected," said Enrico Esposti, analysts at Italian broker ICBPI.
