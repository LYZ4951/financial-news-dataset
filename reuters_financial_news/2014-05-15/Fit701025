May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Rizhao Port (Hong Kong) Company Limited's (Rizhao Port) CNY850m 4.25% credit enhanced bonds denominated in offshore yuan and due 2017 a final 'A' rating. The final rating is in line with the expected rating assigned on 2 May 2014 and follows the  receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. Rizhao Port is wholly owned by Rizhao Port Group Co. Ltd. [RZPOR.UL] (Rizhao Group). As  part of the bond offering, Rizhao Group has granted a keepwell deed, under which  it will provide liquidity to the issuer when needed to ensure Rizhao Port  remains solvent, functions as a going concern and is able to make timely  payments on the notes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit: The rating reflects the credit enhancement  that will be provided to investors by the Shandong Branch of Agricultural Bank  of China Limited (ABC; A/Stable). The note is rated at the same level as ABC's  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) as ABC is bound by agreements made by its  branches and thus the transaction is considered a senior unsecured obligation of  ABC. Investors will have the benefit of an irrevocable standby letter of credit  (SBLC) denominated in Chinese yuan issued by ABC that will expire at 11:59 PM  (Beijing Time) on the maturity date of the proposed bond. The SBLC amount  includes any amount that the issuer has failed to pay into the prefunding  account when required to do so before any payment dates, including at the  maturity of the bonds. In the event of default by the issuer, ABC would be  obligated to the investors for the outstanding principal and interest payable.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
