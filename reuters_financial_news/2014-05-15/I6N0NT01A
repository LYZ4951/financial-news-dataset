MILAN, May 15 (Reuters) - Generali <GASI.MI> said on Thursday net profit rose 9.4 percent to 660 million euros ($905 million) in the first quarter, helped by a rebound in the life segment in Italy, a strong performance in the non-life business and improved financial markets.

The company, Europe's third-largest insurer by market value,  said its closely-watched Solvency I ratio stood at approximately 160 percent at the end of April, close to the level Generali has set as a target in its three-year business plan unveiled last year.
