ATHENS, May 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Greece's largest lender National Bank <NBGr.AT> fell sharply in early Thursday trade on what brokers said was selling pressure ahead of the listing of new stock on May 20.

The bank's shares were down 10.7 percent to 2.16 euros by 0800 GMT, underperforming the Athens bourse banking index <.FTATBNK>, which had shed 2.8 percent. "There is selling ahead of the listing of new shares from the bank's recent equity offering," said a trader at an Athens-based brokerage.  NBG this month became the fourth large Greek bank to successfully tap international markets, completing a 2.5 billion euro ($3.43 billion) equity offering to plug a capital shortfall. The shares were placed at 2.20 euros each.
