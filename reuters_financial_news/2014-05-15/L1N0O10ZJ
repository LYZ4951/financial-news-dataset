TORONTO, May 15 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index slipped on Thursday as weaker commodity prices helped drive down shares of natural resource companies and worries about the lack of positive market catalysts were a drag on sentiment.

Also weighing was a decline in CI Financial Corp <CIX.TO>, a day after Bank of Nova Scotia <BNS.TO> said it will explore options to divest some or all of its 37 percent stake in asset manager and redeploy the capital elsewhere. [ID:nL1N0O0289] Some investors said that the recent gains, which have seen the Toronto market climb nearly 7 percent so far in 2014, could be setting the benchmark up for a pullback. The market has benefited this year from strong advances in the energy and mining sectors, raising concerns that share prices might be getting extended. The energy group had the biggest negative influence on the market on Thursday. Investors are wondering, "where is the growth going to come from?" said Michael Sprung, president of Sprung Investment Management. "Overall, people are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. "In Canada in particular, the market would appear to be ahead of fundamentals in that it's becoming harder to find things that look cheap," he added. "That would tend to indicate, as well, that some form of correction might be a cleansing factor in the market."  The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index <.GSPTSE> was down 120.41 points, or 0.82 percent, at 14,553.32. Nine of the 10 main sectors on the index were in the red. Shares of energy producers dropped 1.4 percent, hurt in part by a decline in the price of U.S. crude oil. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd <CNQ.TO> lost 1.9 percent to C$43.53, and Suncor Energy Inc <SU.TO> was down 1 percent at C$42.63. The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, gave back 0.8 percent. Barrick Gold Corp <ABX.TO> slipped 1.1 percent to C$18.73, and Teck Resources Ltd <TCKb.TO> shed 1.4 percent to C$24.94. Financials, the index's most heavily weighted sector, gave back 0.5 percent, with Manulife Financial Corp <MFC.TO> falling 1.7 percent to C$19.99.
