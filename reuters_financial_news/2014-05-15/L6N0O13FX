WARSAW, May 15 (Reuters) - Poland's biggest bank PKO BP <PKO.WA> sees room for further improvement in its net interest margin, which is under pressure from record-low interest rates, Chief Financial Officer Bartosz Drabikowski said on Thursday.

The lender's net interest margin, a key factor for banks' net profits, stood at 3.7 percent after the first quarter of this year. "There is a chance for a small improvement of the interest margin - I mean 10 basis points by the end of the year - and there is also a chance for a growth in volumes," Drabikowski told a news conference.
