MILAN, May 15 (Reuters) - Italian insurer UnipolSai <US.MI> said on Thursday its net profit in the first three months rose 4.5 percent on a pro-forma basis from the previous year, boosted by its life business.

The insurer born from the merger of Unipol and rival Fondiaria-SAI said its combined ratio, a measure of profitability, stood at 94.1 percent, up from 92.7 percent in the same period last year. A higher ratio signals higher costs and liabilities. The solvency margin, a measure of financial strength, stood at 1.6 times regulatory requirements. Non-life premiums in the first quarter fell 6.9 percent to 2.1 billion euros. Unipolsai said they kept dropping in April though at a slower pace.
