MILAN, May 15 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, swung back to profit in the first quarter thanks to higher operating revenues and further boosted its core capital ratios, already among the highest in the euro-zone's third biggest economy.

The bank booked a net profit of 503 million euros ($689.64 million), well above a forecast of 323 million euros in a Reuters poll of eight analysts. Intesa said it was its best net profit in two years. Like domestic rival UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, Intesa had booked massive loan loss charges in the final quarter of 2013 in preparation for a Europe-wide health check of banks, resulting in full-year loss of 4.55 billion euros.  Loan loss charges remained high in the first quarter, at 1.1 billion euros against 1.16 billion euros a year ago. The stock of impaired loans, which fell at UniCredit for the first time since 2008, was broadly stable for Intesa, at 31.16 billion euros, up 0.6 percent from a year earlier.
