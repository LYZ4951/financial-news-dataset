BOSTON, May 15 (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill<CMG.N> received only about 23 percent support for its executive pay plan at its annual shareholder meeting held on Wednesday, a spokesman for the restaurant chain said.

The company's plan had drawn criticism as being too generous. "We take this very seriously," said Chris Arnold, spokesman for the Denver company, via e-mail.
