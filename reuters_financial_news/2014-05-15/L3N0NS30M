May 15 (Reuters) - Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc <ERM.L>, a publisher of financial magazines, journals and data products, said trading conditions in the first half remained "challenging" as leading financial institutions cut costs.

The company, which generates two-thirds of its revenue outside the UK, also said the strength of sterling versus the dollar began to have a negative impact on profit towards the end of the first half and is expected to have a more significant impact in the second half of its financial year. [ID:nRSO1566Ha] The publisher said revenue for the six months ended March 31 rose to 195.8 million pounds ($328.50 million) from 187.3 million pounds a year earlier. Pretax profit was largely unchanged at 42.8 million pounds.
