EDINBURGH, May 15 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group's <LLOY.L> Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said restarting dividend payments for the first time since its 2008/09 government bailout would help "restore trust and confidence" in the group.

Speaking at the bank's annual meeting in Edinburgh, Horta-Osorio said the bank's intention is to ask Britain's financial regulator for permission to begin paying dividends again in the second half of the year.
