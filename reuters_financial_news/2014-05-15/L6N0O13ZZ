EDINBURGH, May 15 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> is not currently preparing to leave Scotland if it votes for independence from the rest of the United Kingdom, Chairman Norman Blackwell told shareholders at the bank's annual meeting on Thursday.

Lloyds, which owns Bank of Scotland and has its registered offices in Edinburgh, has warned that a vote for independence will impact its cost of funding, taxes and compliance costs.
