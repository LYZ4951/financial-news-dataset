May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that Sony Corporation's <6758.T> (Sony; BB-/Negative) continuing weak performance reiterates our belief that the company's turnaround will be slow at best and that a return to an investment-grade rating is unlikely in the medium term. As Sony's ratings  headroom remains low, if results over the next quarter or half-year indicate  future performance will be weaker than our expectations, the ratings may be  downgraded. Sony is forecasting a net loss of JPY50bn for the year ending 31 March 2015  (FYE15). Excluding Sony Financial Holdings <8729.T> (SFH) - which given its regulated  nature, does not support Sony's credit profile - the company expects an  operating loss of JPY24bn for FYE15, principally due to higher restructuring  charges. However, Fitch believes Sony's ex-SFH profitability will remain low and fragile  in FYE16, too, due to the highly competitive consumer electronics industry and  saturation in developed markets for smartphones. Even excluding restructuring  and impairment charges, ex-SFH operating EBIT margin target for FYE15 is 1.6%,  (FYE13: 3.1%), which is incommensurate with an investment-grade rating. However,  even this margin calculation flatters as restructuring and impairment charges  have become too regular at Sony to be considered one-offs. Sony's restructuring focus in FYE15 will centre on cost reduction in its  electronics distribution companies and headquarters, and the exit from  unprofitable segments. However, Sony has yet to make the difficult decision on  its TV business, which has accumulated JPY790bn losses in the past 10 years.  Sony's non-PC restructuring budget of JPY100bn for FYE15 is too small for a TV  exit plan. Total PC exit costs are estimated to reach JPY94bn, but its PC  business is significantly smaller in scale than its TV operations. Sony is relying on 4K ultra-high definition TVs and the upcoming FIFA World Cup  in Brazil to bolster its TV profitability in FYE15. However, we think that  Japanese companies, including Sony, will struggle to make a meaningful profit in  the TV business as long as their Korean rivals Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. <005930.KS> (A+/Stable) and LG Electronics Inc. <066570.KS> (BBB-/Stable) combine product leadership  with attractive pricing, and low-cost Chinese manufacturers, such as Hisense,  Haier and TCL <000100.SZ>, expand overseas. Fitch believes that more aggressive reform to revamp Sony's product and business  portfolio is overdue. Persistent losses at its electronics business already  invite unfavourable comparison to rivals like Panasonic Corporation <6752.T> (BBB-/Stable) and Sharp Corporation <6753.T>, which have recovered from heavy losses.  Even with the JPY89bn of benefits from Japanese yen devaluation, Sony still  recorded an operating loss of JPY95bn for the electronics business in FYE14.  However, with the currency now stabilising, further forex benefits may be  limited.
