May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The decision by the Kenyan government to extend the term  of a maturing syndicated loan highlights the refinancing risk that some African  countries face as they take on increased amounts of non-concessional market  debt, Fitch Ratings says. It will not affect the country's sovereign ratings.  We have previously said that debut eurobonds for some African issuers are  equivalent to a significant proportion of their international reserves - with  the median for new African issuers at 25%, and in some cases much more (see "SSA  Sovereign Credit Overview" published in December 2013). If a eurobond were to  mature at a time when market access were denied, then an issuer might have no  alternative but to pay the bond out of possibly limited reserves.  A track record of debt repayment to private creditors and adequate debt  management capacity, as well as efficient use of proceeds, will be important  factors in assessing countries' non-concessional debt capacity - an important  rating consideration.   Kenya's USD600m syndicated loan issued in 2012 to fund infrastructure investment  was due to be repaid on 15 May. The government had intended to make the  repayment using part of the proceeds of a forthcoming debut eurobond. However,  this has been delayed.  The authorities considered repaying the facility out of reserves. Reserves  currently stand at USD6.3bn (3.8 months of current external payments - CXP).  Repaying the loan would have seen reserves fall to 3.4 months of CXP - still a  comfortable level, particularly with a eurobond still likely to be issued in the  coming months.  Instead, the authorities have opted to extend the facility for a further three  months (until 15 August) at the same rate as the initial loan. Creditors not  wishing to extend will be repaid. We understand that if the eurobond has not  been issued by August, the syndicated loan will be repaid out of reserves.  Rescheduling a bank loan can, in certain circumstances, be considered a  restricted default with the issuer placed in 'RD' if the loan is material  relative to the total stock of sovereign debt. However, the creditors had  proactively offered this option to the authorities as part of a debt and  reserves management operation, and it is not the case that without the  extension, a missed interest or principal payment would be likely. It will  therefore have no impact on Kenya's sovereign rating.
