May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Bankia, S.A.'s EUR1bn lower tier 2 subordinated debt, issued under its EUR30bn debt issuance programme, a 'B+' rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The debt is notched down one level from Bankia's Viability Rating (VR) of 'bb-'  for loss severity because of lower recovery expectations relative to senior  unsecured debt. The securities are subordinated to all senior creditors.There is  no notching for incremental non-performance risk relative to the bank's VR,  reflecting no coupon flexibility. The rating is in line with Fitch's criteria  'Assessing and Rating Bank Subordinated and Hybrid Securities'.  The securities have a 10-year maturity, bear a fixed reset coupon rate from year  five and are callable by the issuer from year five, subject to regulatory  authorisation.   RATING SENSITIVITIES
