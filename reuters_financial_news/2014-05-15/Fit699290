May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Jubilee CLO 2014-XII B.V. notes final ratings, as follows: EUR302m Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable EUR51m Class B1: 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR5m Class B2: 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR26.5m Class C: 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR24.9m Class D: 'BBB+sf'; Outlook Stable EUR36.9m Class E: 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR19m Class F: 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable EUR47.8m subordinated notes: not rated Jubilee CLO 2014-XII B.V. is an arbitrage cash flow CLO.  KEY RATING DRIVERS 'B' Portfolio Credit Quality Fitch expects the average credit quality of obligors to be in the 'B' rating  category. Fitch has credit opinions on 90% of the indicative portfolio and has a  public rating on the remaining entities. The weighted average rating factor of  the initial portfolio is 32.2.  Above-Average Recoveries The portfolio comprises a minimum of 90% of senior secured loans and senior  secured bonds. Recovery prospects for these assets are typically more favourable  than for second-lien, unsecured, and mezzanine assets. Fitch has assigned  recovery ratings to 100% of the indicative portfolio. The weighted average  recovery rate  of the initial portfolio is 71.7%.  Above-Average WAS and WAC The covenanted minimum weighted average spread and weighted average coupon   indicated by the investment manager to be the expected combination as of the  effective date are 4.2% and 6.2%, respectively; these are above the typical  values for CLOs rated recently by Fitch. This is particularly beneficial to  junior notes with low credit enhancement.  Above-Average Obligor Concentration Portfolio profile tests limit the exposure to the top five obligors in the  portfolio to 3% each. This is above the typical numbers for CLOs rated recently  by Fitch. Exposure to other obligors within the pool is not allowed to exceed  2.5% each for senior secured loans or senior secured bonds and 1.5% each for any  other debt obligations.  Limited FX Risk All non-euro-denominated assets have to be hedged as of the settlement date  using suitable asset swaps and are limited to 30% of the portfolio.   Limited Interest Rate Risk Fixed rate assets can account for no more than 10% of the portfolio, while fixed  rate liabilities account for 1% of the target par amount.  TRANSACTION SUMMARY Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes are being used to purchase a  EUR498.75m portfolio of European leveraged loans and bonds. The portfolio is  managed by Alcentra Limited. The reinvestment period is scheduled to end in  2018. The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or note holder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a comment if the  change would not have a negative impact on the then current ratings. Such  amendments may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis  confirms the expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity. If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from the perspective of  the rating Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that the  structure considers the confirmation to be given in the case where Fitch  declines to comment.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A 25% increase in the expected obligor default probability would lead to a  downgrade of one to three notches for the rated notes. A 25% reduction in the  expected recovery rates would lead to a downgrade of one to two notches for the  rated notes.
