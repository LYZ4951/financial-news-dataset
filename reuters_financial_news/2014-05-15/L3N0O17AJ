SYDNEY, May 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open lower on Friday, tracking Wall Street's pull-back from record highs, as investors eye potential risks offshore in the absence of any big local drivers.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> fell 0.5 percent to 5,496.0, a 14.8-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark rose 0.3 percent on Thursday to hit a two-week high. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 0.4 percent in early trade. * U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, giving the Dow and the S&P 500 their worst declines in more than a month, as small-cap shares extended their retreat and Wal-Mart results disappointed. * Nickel prices recouped some losses on Thursday, paring an earlier 10 percent fall as investors seized the opportunity to jump back into a market, where there are expectations of future gains as supply shortages become more severe. * Wilmar International <WLIL.SI> and First Pacific Co  <0142.HK> have sweetened a deal to take over Goodman Fielder Ltd  <GFF.AX>, after the Australian food firm rejected the initial bid as too low last month. [ID:nL3N0O1389] * Santos Ltd <STO.AX> will hold its annual general meeting on Friday.  ---------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 23:06 GMT ------------------  INSTRUMENTLASTPCT CHGNET CHG S&P 500<.SPX>1,870.85-0.94%-17.680 USD/JPY<JPY=>101.52-0.04%-0.040 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>2.496--0.000 SPOT GOLD<XAU=>$1,296.100.01%0.100 US CRUDE<CLc1>$101.600.10%0.100 DOW JONES<.DJI>16446.81-1.01%-167.16 ASIA ADRS<.BKAS>143.04-0.57%-0.82 -------------------------------------------------------------   * Wall St falls for 2nd day; small caps slide again   [.N]   * Brent rises at June contract expiration, U.S. crude falls [O/R]   * Gold drops 0.9 pct on technicals, bright US economic data [GOL/]   * Nickel recoups some losses after falling 10 pct  [MET/L]  DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
