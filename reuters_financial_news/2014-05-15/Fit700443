May 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has published its new criteria for  rating Portuguese and Spanish electricity tariff deficit (TD) securitisations.  There are no rating implications for existing TD securitisation transactions as  the criteria framework broadly reflects analytical practices that Fitch has  already followed when rating these transactions. The final criteria reflect the  rating rationale proposed in the exposure draft, as most of the feedback  received had previously been considered. Fitch believes the ratings of TD securitisations cannot be more than three  notches higher than the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of the relevant sovereign,  mainly because our central expectation is that macroeconomic trends and  regulatory policies have a direct impact on the equilibrium of the electricity  system and in turn, on the recoverability of TD credit rights. We consider that  electricity system revenues are supported and influenced (both positively and  negatively) by the economic strength of a country and the stability or  volatility of its legal and institutional framework, factors that are indicated  by the sovereign IDR as a starting point. When determining the distance between the TD securitisation rating and the  sovereign IDR, Fitch assesses quantitative and qualitative factors such as the  electricity regulator's powers and independence, the electricity system's  financial profile, and whether or not a credible agenda is in place that aims to  eliminate TDs within a realistic timeframe.
