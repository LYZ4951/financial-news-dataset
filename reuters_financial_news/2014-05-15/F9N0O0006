BERLIN, May 15 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank sees no distinct signs of deflation in the euro area for the time being but is ready to act if needed, ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said on Wednesday.

"There is an on-going economic recovery in the euro area which is broad-based as it is now happening in all member countries," Constancio said in the text of a speech for delivery in Berlin. But he added: "We have ... reaffirmed our forward guidance and stressed that we are determined to act swiftly if required and do not rule out further monetary policy easing."
