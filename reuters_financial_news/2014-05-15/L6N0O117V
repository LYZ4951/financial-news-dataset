STOCKHOLM, May 15 (Reuters) - Swedish home prices rose 1.0 percent in April from March and 9.3 percent from a year earlier, the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) showed on Thursday.

Prices for apartments rose 0.6 percent compared to the previous month and 12.5 percent compared to the same month last year. Prices for single homes rose 1.2 percent during March and 7.7 percent during the year. The HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends. Swedish house prices have nearly tripled over the last 20 years and both the centre-right government and financial regulators are worried about high levels of household debt and the risk of a bubble in the housing market.
