FRANKFURT, May 15 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> said it struck a deal to sell its casino complex in Las Vegas to buyout group Blackstone <BX.N> for $1.73 billion in cash, drawing a line under an unwanted investment that has weighed on its balance sheet for years.

The lender made a "small profit" from the sale of casino, called The Cosmopolitan, a spokesman said on Thursday.
