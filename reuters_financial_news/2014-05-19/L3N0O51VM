MUMBAI, May 19 (Reuters) - The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party's resounding election win is credit positive for India as it boosts the prospect that a stable government will address the country's economic challenges, Moody's Investor Service said on Monday.

Moody's rates India "Baa3", the lowest investment-grade rating with a "stable" outlook. "The completion of the election will allow stalled policies relating to the corporate and infrastructure sectors to resume, a credit positive for the country's corporates," said Vikas Halan, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's, said in a statement. Rival rating agency Standard & Poor's also rates India at the lowest investment grade, but with a "negative" outlook. Investors are increasingly betting on a turnaround in the Indian economy after the Narendra Modi-led BJP and its allies won a more decisive-than-expected 334 seats in India's 543-member lower house in vote counting on Friday.
