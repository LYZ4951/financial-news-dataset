DUBAI, May 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co <4300.SE> will start meeting international investors on Tuesday ahead of a potential Islamic bond issue, the firm said in a bourse filing.

A sukuk offering, under the developer's established programme, will follow subject to market conditions, a statement on Monday said.
