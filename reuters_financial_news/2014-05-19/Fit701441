May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that Deutsche Bank's <DBKGn.DE> planned EUR8bn capital increase will help the bank adapt to a changing regulatory and business environment, particularly as it continues to implement its recalibration programme "2015+".  The capital increase will not affect Deutsche Bank's ratings (A+/Negative/a),  even though it would have lifted its common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. This  reflects the bank's unchanged targets, including maintaining a 10% fully applied  CRDIV CET1 ratio and a fully-loaded leverage ratio of 3.5% in the medium term.  Overshooting these targets in the short term will not change Fitch's view that  maintaining Deutsche Bank's Viability Rating (VR) at the current 'a' level is  contingent on the delivery of its recalibration programme, albeit over a longer  timeframe. Slippage in capital ratios relative to peers would put pressure on  the bank's VR. The Outlook on Deutsche Bank's support-driven Long-term Issuer Default Rating is  Negative, reflecting our expectation of weakening government support. The capital increase would have lifted Deutsche Bank's CET1 ratio on a pro-forma  basis (fully applied basis) to 11.8% at end-1Q14 from 9.5%, which is at the  upper end of the Global Trading and Universal Banks peer group range although  leverage, excluding legacy hybrid securities, continues to be high compared with  peers. Furthermore, the increase will provide a larger common equity buffer for  investors in the bank's planned issue of EUR5bn Additional Tier 1 capital  instruments, which should assist in the pricing of these notes. Deutsche Bank's material capital increase will also give it more stability to  cope with regulatory changes and a challenging business environment at a time  when the outlook for its 2014 earnings has become more negative. Fitch expects  further pressure on fixed income trading, which depressed the 2013 performance  of Deutsche Bank's securities business. As weaker investment banking profits  would limit Deutsche Bank's ability to absorb potential litigation expenses and  legacy costs in its non-core operating unit, the capital injection provides a  substantial buffer for these unpredictable events and reduces uncertainty during  the adjustment phase.   The bank's fully applied CRDIV CET1 ratio dropped in 1Q14 by 20bp to 9.5%. The  ratio will face further pressure for the rest of the year as new regulations  including prudent valuation adjustments are implemented and due to uncertainty  around the potential impact from ECB's upcoming asset quality review on the  bank's capital ratios as well as any additional capital requirements that may  emerge from European Banking Authority's stress test.
