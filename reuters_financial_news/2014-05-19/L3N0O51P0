HONG KONG, May 19 (Reuters) - Global private equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd [CVC.UL] said on Monday it has completed a $3.5 billion fund for investments in Asia, CVC Capital Partners Asia Pacific IV LP.

London-headquartered CVC raised $3.3 billion from investors for its fourth Asia fund and will add $200 million from its partners for a total of $3.5 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The fund is 15 percent smaller than the firm's previous Asia fund of $4.12 billion raised in 2008. That fund suffered from the impact of CVC's $1.8 billion loss on its investment in Nine Entertainment Co <NEC.AX> in Australia, Asia's biggest ever private equity loss. CVC pulled out of investing in Australia, Asia's biggest buyout market, because of that deal, and was expected to raise a smaller fund when it came back to the market, Reuters previously reported.

The firm's recent focus has been on Southeast Asia and Greater China, with investments including the $1.7 billion buyout of QSR Brands and KFC Holdings through a consortium in Malaysia, and the acquisition of large stakes in restaurant chain South Beauty and education company EIC Group in China.
