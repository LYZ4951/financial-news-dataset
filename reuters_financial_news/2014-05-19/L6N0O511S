LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - A new standards body for British bankers will be launched later this year with a chairman appointed by an independent panel led by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.

Richard Lambert, a former director general of the Confederation of British Industry, who was tasked with setting the body up, said it would be a champion for better banking standards in the UK.
