SEOUL, May 19 (Reuters) - Seoul shares reversed earlier losses to inch up to a fresh closing high this year on Monday, as foreign capital inflows more than offset profit-taking while the won <KRW=> firmed on demand from exporters.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> finished up 0.1 percent at 2,015.14 points, the highest close since Dec. 2, 2013. The index rose 2.9 percent last week. Foreign investors were net buyers for a fifth straight session, bringing their total net inflows during the period to 1.6 trillion Korean won ($1.56 billion), according to preliminary figures from the exchange operator. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,022.0 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.2 percent from Friday's close at 1,024.0.
