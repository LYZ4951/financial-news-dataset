May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The first U.S. CMBS 2.0 loan defaults have surfaced,  though they were driven by idiosyncratic events and do not appear to be the  start of prolonged rising defaults, according to Fitch Ratings in a new report. Nine loans totaling $74.9 million defaulted last year on CMBS deals issued  between 2010 and 2013. Eight of the defaults were on loans for multifamily  properties. Causes were largely due to tenant bankruptcies and financially  challenged sponsors, according to U.S. CMBS Director Brook Sutherland. 'The largest CMBS 2.0 default occurred when a major office tenant vacated before  their lease expired,' said Sutherland. 'The multifamily CMBS defaults were  mostly on smaller properties that, despite adequate property performance, were  chronically late with payments possibly because of organizational problems at  the sponsor level.' Fitch identified an additional 12 CMBS loans totaling $157.5 million  transferring to special servicing but averting default. Despite these outliers, the rate of CMBS 2.0 defaults should remain low. Whereas  the average annual default rate for CMBS 1.0 (excluding 2005-2007 deals) is  roughly 0.7%, the CMBS 2.0 default rate comes in at less than 0.02%. That number  stands to slowly increase with higher leverage and more aggressive underwriting  taking hold in recent months. A bigger concern over time, however, will be  balloon risk. 'If interest rates are substantially higher when the CMBS loan  matures, refinancing is likely to be more difficult unless there is some  appreciation in cash flow,' said Sutherland.
