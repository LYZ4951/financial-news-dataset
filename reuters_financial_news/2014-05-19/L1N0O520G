WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky said on Monday he had decided not to initiate proceedings to revoke Credit Suisse's <CSGN.VX> New York license over its role in helping Americans evade taxes.

Lawsky said in a statement after Credit Suisse agreed to plead guilty to U.S. criminal charges that the Swiss bank would pay a $715 million penalty as part of an agreement with his agency and be required to install an independent monitor as part of the settlement.
