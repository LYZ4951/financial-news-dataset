May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned France-based SGD Group SAS (SGD Pharma) a final Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'B' with Stable Outlook and the group's EUR350m senior secured notes a final 'B'/'RR4' rating. The final ratings are in line with the expected rating and follow the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. The ratings are based solely on SGD Group's pharma business and exclude the  perfumery business, which is being demerged from the group, with expected  completion by end-2015. The ratings are also based on our assumption that SGD  Pharma will continue to pay for the operational costs of the perfumery business  until separation is complete and that the shareholder, Oaktree Capital, will  provide credit support for any indemnity.  The ratings reflect SGD Pharma's limited scale of operations and fairly high  funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage, which we forecast to reduce to  around 5.5x from around 6.0x at end-13. However, the group's credit profile is  supported by leading positions in the stable pharma glass packaging market, high  barriers to entry and limited end-market and customer concentration.   KEY RATING DRIVERS High Leverage Leverage is high, but adequate for the ratings. FCF generation over the next two  years will be limited by large investment outlays of EUR75m. We expect the group  to be FCF positive from 2016, when it completes the separation of its perfumery  and pharma operations and capex returns to normalised levels.   Sound Business Profile SGD Pharma's business profile is commensurate with the 'B' rating category. The  limited scale of its operations and focus on the pharmaceutical glass market are  mitigated by a range of therapeutic end-markets served by its products. In  addition, customer concentration is limited, eliminating dependency on the  success of single drugs, formats or customers.  Stable End-Markets The molded glass packaging market has been growing at healthy rates of around 4%  since the 2009 recession. We expect long-term favourable demand growth for  pharma packaging, driven by global growth in population, life expectancy,  chronic diseases and fast-growing demand for healthcare and pharma in emerging  markets.   Strong Market Positions SGD Pharma has strong market positions, particularly in the profitable type I  glass market, where it holds a 30% global share. The market for this type of  glass is highly concentrated, with the top three players supplying 80% of the  market. In its core western European markets (63% of revenues), the group is the  undisputed leader in type II and III glass markets with a 55% and 33% share,  respectively.  High Barriers to Entry The group's profitability is protected in the short- to medium-term by high  entry barriers provided by its technological leadership, the large investments  required to set up new production and high switching costs for customers,  including high regulatory requirements and the reputational risks associated  with product quality issues. For SGD Pharma's customers, switching suppliers is  therefore often not economical, given that the price of packaging is small  compared with the price of the final product. It amounts to up to 3% for type I  glass and up to 5% for type II glass.  Refurbished Asset Base The group's assets benefit from large historical investments. This will enable  it to reduce maintenance capex for a number of years, particularly during the  construction of its new French plant and the operational separation of its  pharma and perfumery businesses, which is capital-intensive.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - FFO adjusted leverage below 4.0x - Positive FCF generation through the cycle Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - FFO adjusted leverage above 6.0x - Quality issues, operational disruptions or growing competitive pressure in  type II or III markets, resulting in EBITDA margin in the teens - Liquidity pressures from negative FCF or covenant breaches
