NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The growing role of exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the US leveraged loan market raised fears of heightened secondary market volatility when the market cooled after supply mounted and inflows reversed for the first time in 96 weeks in late April.

Loan ETFs are a relatively new entrant to the world of loan investing. The highly liquid investment vehicles track the performance of an index of the largest institutional leveraged loans but trade like stocks on an exchange.  While ETFs allow more investors to extend credit to riskier companies, the appearance of the high-velocity instruments has raised the prospect of dramatic shifts in secondary loan prices. Loan ETFs can be bought and sold immediately, unlike mutual funds which are bought and sold typically only once a day, and many question their suitability for use in the relatively illiquid US leveraged loan market.  "The presence of ETFs in the leveraged finance market has evolved into a source of potential and realized volatility," said Edward Marrinan, head of credit strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland.  Loan ETF assets under management have grown dramatically over the last 16 months, ramping up from $1.5 billion to $8.4 billion, according to ETFGI, an independent ETF research company.  Despite this dramatic rise, ETFs are still a small segment of the leveraged loan buyers at just over 1 percent of the $729 billion institutional S&P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, which has muted the impact of outflows on secondary pricing so far.  The SMi 100, which measures the 100 largest loans in the leveraged loan index, had an average bid of 99.08 when retail outflows started in the week of April 15. The index finished April at the same level and was trading at 99.32 on May 15.  ETFs are still growing and the potential for greater volatility remains. Managers have to keep ETF trading prices aligned with the value of underlying assets by buying or selling the leveraged loans that the fund tracks. If prices move too far in either direction, managers need to buy or sell large amounts of loans quickly, which could hit secondary prices.  "While ETFs allow investors to express their views about riskier credit, the crossover of an equity product into below-investment grade debt can create technical dislocations that exacerbate market price swings," Marrinan added.  Leveraged loans trade over the counter and anticipated forced selling can encourage dealers to widen bid-ask spreads to take advantage of a relatively illiquid market.   Tracking high-yield  Although banks have pared down inventories of riskier assets due to stricter global capital and liquidity regulations, loan ETFs could mirror the larger high-yield ETF market which manages $37 billion of assets.  ETF assets are five times greater than banks' high yield bond inventories, which means that high yield trading could see heightened bond illiquidity and price swings in times of market stress, according to a Fitch report in May.  The report said that average weekly high yield trading volume fell 6 percent after the Federal Reserve began tapering discussions last June, while high yield ETF trading volume rose 18 percent.  ETF liquidity could work against high yield ETF managers trying to dump holdings during big market outflows by forcing bids for high-yield bonds lower in an illiquid market. This erodes ETF net asset value and may encourage more selling if a significant enough pricing gap between ETF prices and net asset values emerge.  Sharper price swings caused by high yield outflows has not been seen yet. But, as leveraged loan ETFs continue to grow, they are expected to have the same potential for volatility as their high yield ETF cousins.  "If leveraged loan ETFs become a more significant player in the future, there is the potential for higher volatility to the market," said Stephen Oh, global head of Credit and Fixed Income at PineBridge Investments.   Balancing effect  The impact of leveraged loan ETFs has been reduced by the willingness of other loan investors, primarily CLOs, to buy loans on any weakness prompted by outflows. New CLO issuance has already topped $40 billion this year and is ahead of last year's $81 billion full-year pace.  Inflows of $81 billion into retail leveraged loan funds also far outpace the $937 million in April, according to Lipper data, which suggests that those retail funds have some dry powder on the sidelines to cushion market softening.  "If the asset class experiences technical selling because of retail outflows, institutional investors will step in seeing value and provide pricing support," said Ethan Powell, chief product strategist at Highland Capital.  While potentially volatile, ETFs remain a convenient vehicle for retail investors to diversify their portfolios into less liquid assets.
