May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Brazil's airports are likely to accommodate the traffic challenges the World Cup will present, Fitch Ratings says. Approximately 3.7 million passengers are expected to travel to the 12 venues for the FIFA World Cup Brazil 2014, 600,000 of whom are likely to be foreign  tourists. Rio de Janeiro should see approximately 544,000 visitors, and Sao  Paulo, about 390,000. It kicks off on June 12, with the final scheduled for July  13. As Brazil's railway network is limited, airport infrastructure will be critical.  According to Empresa Brasileira de Infraestrutura Aeroportuaria (INFRAERO),  approximately BRL5.6 billion was invested in the improvement of airport  infrastructure for the World Cup. Most was dedicated to building or renovating  passenger terminals, airplane berths and airstrip conditions.  The majority of airports are ready to accommodate the expected additional  transit. The northeastern venues of Salvador, Natal and Recife are already  accustomed to operate at capacity during December/January summer vacations and  Carnival season. Ten of the airports are controlled by INFRAERO. In our view, Aeroporto  Internacional Marechal Rondon - Cuiaba (four matches), Aeroporto Internacional  Pinto Martins - Fortaleza (six matches) and Aeroporto Internacional Tancredo  Neves (Confins) - Belo Horizonte (six matches) present the most significant risk  of delays in finishing construction works by the World Cup. The Cuiaba airport  presents the most challenging situation, with only 75% of scheduled works  completed, while Fortaleza will operate through temporary structures.  Under private concessions, Aeroporto Internacional Presidente Juscelino  Kubitschek - Brasilia (seven matches) and Aeroporto Internacional Governador  Andre Franco Montoro - Guarulhos/Sao Paulo (six matches) concluded most of their  BRL4.0 billion investments. The latter opened its new international passenger  terminal on May 11, 2014. Construction continues at both airports.
