LAGOS, May 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira weakened marginally against the dollar on the interbank market on Monday, as investors repatriated some dividends, and dealers said markets were waiting for Tuesday's central bank rate decision to take positions.

The naira closed at 162.60 to the dollar, down 0.1 percent from Friday's close of 162.45. Some dollar flows from offshore interest in local debt came in, but demand was slightly stronger, dealers said.
