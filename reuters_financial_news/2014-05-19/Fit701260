May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Nykredit Realkredit's [FRNYKR.UL] (A/Stable/F1) planned issue of Tier 2 contingent capital notes an expected rating of 'BBB(EXP)'. The final rating is contingent upon final documents conforming to information  already received.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The notes are subordinated Tier 2 instruments without a coupon deferral feature  and subject to a 7% capital adequacy trigger. On breach of the trigger, the  notes will be automatically written down to zero and the notes cancelled,  resulting in loss of principal and future interest for investors. The capital  adequacy trigger is based on Nykredit Realkredit's individual or consolidated  common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio or Nykredit Holding's consolidated CET1 ratio. The notes are rated three notches below Nykredit Realkredit's 'a' Viability  Rating (VR) in accordance with Fitch's criteria for "Assessing and Rating Bank  Subordinated and Hybrid Securities" dated 31 January 2014 at  www.fitchratings.com. The notes are notched twice for loss severity to reflect  the principal write-down feature, and once for non-performance risk, to reflect  the moderate incremental risk due to the 7% CET1 ratio trigger, partly offset by  the large capital buffer above this trigger point, compared with the risk  reflected in the bank's VR.  The notes have been assigned an equity credit of 50%.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT
