May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based PT  Mitra Pinasthika Mustika Tbk's (MPM) Long-Term National Rating at 'A(idn)' and  simultaneously withdrawn the rating.  The rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has  decided to discontinue the rating, which is uncompensated.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Improving Operating Performance: MPM's recent expansion in the car rental  business has generated higher operating cash flow, diversified its income stream  and balanced the volatility from the auto retail business. The performance of  its motorcycle financing subsidiary, PT Sasana Artha Finance (SAF), has also  improved and SAF reported positive net earnings for 2013 after posting net  losses for the previous three years. Overall, we see improvement in the credit  metrics compared with the previous year. Net debt/EBITDA declined to 3.6x in  2013 from 5.2x in 2012. The coverage ratio, as measured by operating  EBITDA/gross interest expense, also improved to 5.9x  from 4.7x over the same  period. Diversified Earnings Stream: MPM's rating is underpinned by its diversified  business, which mitigates the cyclicality in the more volatile motorcycle retail  market. MPM's other businesses include motorcycle lubricants, auto rental  services, financing and insurance. Compared with the auto retail business, the  rental services and lubricants businesses provide more stable income and higher  margins. From 2014, MPM will also start selling Nissan and Datsun cars. Market Leadership: MPM's rating reflects its leadership in the major market  segments it operates in. MPM is the main dealer for Honda motorcycles in East  Java and East Nusa Tenggara, where it controls 67% of each of the two markets.  Its auto rental service is now the second-largest by fleet size, while its oil  lubricant business is the largest by sales volume within motorcycle lubricant  market.  New Structure for Subsidiaries and New Shareholder: Fitch also views positively  MPM's plan to merge its two financing subsidiary - MPM Finance (A-(idn)/Stable)  and SAF - and to partner JACCS, a Japanese financing company that will inject  IDR510bn and effectively own 40% of the merged entity. The entry of JACCS is  likely to provide MPM with better access to funding and knowledge, particularly  in risk management.  Constrained by Expansion: The rating is constrained by MPM's debt-funded  expansion, primarily to expand its auto rental and car retail business. We  forecast free cash flow (FCF) to remain negative in the next three years.
