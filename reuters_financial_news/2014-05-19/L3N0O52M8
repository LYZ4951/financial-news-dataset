May 19 (Reuters) - Malaysian shares hit a record high on Monday, helped by foreign inflows after the country's economic growth came in above expectations in the first quarter, but Indonesia retreated due to a surprise political move by the country's second largest party.

Malaysia's stock index <.KLSE> hit a record high of 1,889.47 in intraday trade and ended at an all-time closing high of 1,887.07, surpassing the previous peak close of 1,883.34 hit on Friday. Kuala Lumpur enjoyed foreign inflows of $70.37 million on Monday, as investors snapped up risky assets after the country's annual economic growth showed a pickup in the first quarter to its fastest in more than a year.[ID:nL3N0O10XV] However, Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) <MASM.KL> shares fell 18.4 percent to a record low on Monday, its second day of sharp declines. The airline said on Thursday that a sharp drop in passenger traffic was likely to prevent it from returning to profit this year. [ID:nL3N0O2048]  Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> closed 0.3 percent weaker, surrendering an early gain of 1 percent, after the country's second largest party, Golkar, said it would support former general Prabowo Subianto in July's presidential election.  Many had expected Golkar to support front-runner Joko "Jokowi" Widodo.  The market traded higher earlier after Jokowi named Golkar senior party official and former vice president Jusuf Kalla as his running mate. [ID:nL3N0O5252]  With the deadline for filing nominations close, investors were cautious, watching each move of the political parties, said John Teja, director of Jakarta-based broker Ciptadana Securities. Other Southeast Asian markets traded slightly firmer despite the rest of Asia being led down by China on concerns of slower growth in the world's second-biggest economy. [MKTS/GLOB] Thailand's SET index <.SETI> rose 0.4 percent to its highest close since May 2 with $16.73 million in foreign inflows despite data showing the country's economy shrank more than expected as exports remained weak and domestic activity was battered by months of political unrest. [ID:nL3N0O50HN]  Philippines <.PSE> outperformed the region with 0.8 percent gain, while Singapore <.FTSTI> ended steady. Vietnam <.VNI> recovered from early losses to close 0.7 percent firmer on foreign buying. For Asian Companies click; [nTOPEQA]   For South East Asia Hot Stock reports, click; [.SI] [.KL] [.BK]
