FRANKFURT, May 19 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> may see its investment banking revenues decrease in the second quarter as trading of fixed income products remains weak, Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause said in an analyst conference on Monday.

"Based on a quarter-to-date performance, CB&S revenues could be lower in second quarter versus the second quarter of 2013," Krause said.  "Fixed income revenues are largely down quarter-to-date from the prior year. So no improvement in that trend."
