May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says its recently published Criteria for Sovereign Risk in Developed Markets for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds will not have an immediate impact on ratings for European CLOs. However, the new criteria reduce the available cushion for 'AAAsf' ratings, which will become more sensitive to any deterioration in performance.  Most European CLOs have partial exposure to loans extended to borrowers which  are domiciled in Spain, Italy or Ireland or receive a substantial share of their  revenues from these countries. For first generation CLOs that closed before  2008, the exposure to these three countries is generally less than 15%. For  second generation European CLOs, starting from 2013 the manager is only allowed  to invest up to 10% of the par amount in assets from countries with a sovereign  rating below 'A-'. Although the limit would include other jurisdictions as well,  in practice this limit effectively relates to Spain, Italy and Ireland as the  only countries with significant volumes of outstanding leveraged loans. The  Country Ceiling for all three countries is currently 'AA+'.   While the ratings of SF transactions from Spain, Italy and Ireland are currently  capped at 'AA+sf', CLOs can still achieve a 'AAAsf' rating due to their partial  exposure to these countries. In particular, Fitch would assign a 'AAAsf' rating  to CLO notes whose credit quality is sufficiently strong to withstand the  stresses resulting from the possible exit of all three countries from the euro,  which would cause at the very least significant performance volatility for the  underlying borrowers, currency transfer and convertibility (T&C) issues and FX  risk for any proceeds from outstanding loans. Fitch believes that the borrowers  are likely to default in such a scenario and as a result the T&C and FX risk  following a euro exit would primarily apply to any recovery proceeds.  Under the current market circumstances, our CLO analysis will therefore assume  all borrowers from countries with a Country Ceiling below the target rating to  default. For example for a typical second generation European CLO with the 10%  investment limit in countries with a sovereign rating below 'A-', the usual  projected default rate for the 'AAAsf' scenarios is approximately 60%, which  would be assumed to include a 10% exposure to Spain, Italy and Ireland. The  remaining 50% of defaults would be spread across other countries, which would be  consistent with Fitch's typical 'AAAsf' default expectations for portfolios not  exposed to countries with a Country Ceiling below the target rating. The total  default rate assumption would remain unchanged. The expected recovery rate at a  'AAAsf' rating for the 10% exposure bucket will be reduced by 50% assuming a  devaluation of the currency against the euro. As a result the aggregate recovery  assumption for a 'AAAsf' rating scenario for a typical second generation CLO  would decline to 32% from approximately 35%.
