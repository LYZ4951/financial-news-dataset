TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - Japan's former top banking regulator on Monday said consolidation is necessary for the survival of regional banks as it will allow them to take new kinds of risk.

"Regional lenders have to take new risks, especially (to provide) equity-type funds," said Hirofumi Gomi, commissioner of the Financial Services Agency between 2004 and 2007. "To take such risks, consolidation among regional lenders is inevitable," Gomi said at the Reuters Japan Summit. Regional banks mainly extend low-risk loans to small and mid-sized businesses but are suffering weak demand. So they need to provide riskier and thus more profitable forms of financing, Gomi said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Tokyo. Gomi, now an advisor at law firm Nishimura & Asahi, is a former career bureaucrat. He joined the Ministry of Finance in 1972 and rose to become the Japan's top financial regulator.
