May 19 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed four pass-through certificates (PTCs) from four Indian ABS transactions, namely Aeon Trust 2012, Aeon Trust II 2012, Aeon Trust 2013 and Shri Trust - B - 2013. These transactions are backed by commercial-vehicle loans originated by Sundaram  Finance Limited <SNFN.NS> (SFL), which also acts as a servicer for the transactions. The rating actions are listed at the end of this rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect satisfactory asset performance and sufficient credit  enhancement (CE) for the rated notes. For each transaction, CE has increased  from the closing date, driven by the steady amortisation of the static  portfolios. As these pools amortised, most portfolio characteristics have not  changed materially from when the transactions closed. The pools have become more  diversified geographically as loans in previously concentrated states rapidly  amortised. The weighted average seasoning has increased to levels above 30  months; loans have become increasingly concentrated in more recent vintages; and  the proportion of loans for new commercial vehicles has increased to well above  90%. Delinquency levels have been kept low by SFL's satisfactory origination  standards and efficient servicing capabilities.  For all four transactions, the CE is in the form of a fixed deposit, and they  have not been utilised since closing as excess spread has been sufficient to  absorb charge-offs to date. In 2014, delinquencies are generally expected to increase for Fitch-rated  asset-backed securitisation (ABS) transactions in India. This is due to India's  economic slowdown, which has been exacerbated by the recent depreciation of the  Indian rupee, rising fuel prices, and political uncertainty. However, the impact  from such stress on these four transactions is likely to be limited compared  with other rated transactions given the relatively high weighted average  seasoning and SFL's satisfactory origination and servicing standards. In  addition, the notes can withstand stresses well above base-case levels, and CE  is likely to build up rapidly due to the fast amortisation of the underlying  portfolios. Together, they create sufficient buffers for the transactions  against India's economic uncertainties.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch considers a downgrade to be unlikely for all four transactions. For Aeon Trust 2012, given the current CE of 100%, a rating downgrade is  considered unlikely.  For Aeon Trust II 2012, based on the current CE of 76.7%, an increase in the  base-case default rate by 4.3x to 13.0%, while keeping other risk factors  constant, may result in a one-notch downgrade of the PTCs to 'BB+sf'.  For Aeon Trust 2013 and Shri Trust - B - 2013, based on the current CE of 28.6%  and 29.2% respectively, an increase in the base-case default rate by 2.7x to  8.0%, while keeping other risk factors constant, may result in a one-notch  downgrade of the PTCs to 'BB+sf'.  Initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivity are described further in the  new issue reports for Aeon Trust 2012 dated 8 February 2012 and Aeon Trust II  2012 dated 10 April 2012.
