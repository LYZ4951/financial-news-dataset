LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Britain's Jupiter Fund Management <JUP.L>, a top-30 shareholder in UK pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca <AZN.L>, said it is disappointed with the firm's rejection of U.S. rival Pfizer <PFE.N>'s final takeover offer.

"We are disappointed the board of AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's latest offer so categorically. They should have at least engaged in a constructive conversation with Pfizer on the details of the offer to assess the opportunities that a combined entity could bring." said Jupiter fund manager Alastair Gunn. "There now seems little room left to manoeuvre with Pfizer having ruled out a hostile bid. We will be expressing our dissatisfaction to the AstraZeneca board over the way the bid process has been handled up to now."
