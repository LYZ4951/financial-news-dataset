BUCHAREST, April 28 (Reuters) - Franklin Templeton, the manager of Romania's investment fund Fondul Proprietatea <FP.BX> aims for a secondary Fondul listing on the London Stock Exchange in September-October, manager Grzegorz Konieczny said on Monday.

Fondul shareholders approved the secondary listing at a general meeting on Monday.  They have also approved a fourth buyback programme of 10 percent of Fondul's issued share capital. The buybacks aim to narrow the discount between its net asset value and its stock price, which stands at roughly 30 percent. [ID:nL6N0M41FU]
