April 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that sector-driven  fundamentals will remain key to rating movements of peripheral euro zone  corporates in 2014 and 2015. In particular peripheral issuers in the telecoms  and utilities sectors continue to face significant pressure from regulatory  changes, challenging business environments and intense competition. Peripheral euro zone issuers faced a sharper deterioration in operating  environments and cash generation compared with the broader EMEA corporate  portfolio through the last financial crisis. Slow real GDP growth is forecast  across the beleaguered periphery in 2014, which will slightly improve  corporates' debt capacity and rating headroom from 2013's lows. We also expect peripheral corporates to see moderate deleveraging in 2014 after  median leverage levels increased sharply in 2009 and were sustained at elevated  levels since. Cash conservation measures employed in recent years will, however,  continue, limiting expansionary capex and M&A over the next 12 to 18 months.  This, together with improved cash generation from a slowly recovering euro zone,  is expected to bear fruit in 2014 and 2015, enabling a gradual fall in median  leverage over the next two years. We, however, forecast leverage to remain  higher than pre-crisis levels for the foreseeable future. The report also discusses key rating drivers for select peripheral issuers  across the various corporate sectors.
