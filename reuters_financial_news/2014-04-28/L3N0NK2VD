MUMBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Monday, retreating from record highs hit on Friday, weighed down by profit-taking in blue chips such as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> and choppy global markets.

Investors also remained wary ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meet starting Tuesday, coming at a time of continued tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine. [ID:nL2N0NF2C7] Although hopes for a recovery in the economy and that the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Narendra Modi will win elections continue to support shares, upcoming earnings results could keep trading volatile. Idea Cellular <IDEA.NS> is scheduled to report its results later in the day, while Bharti Airtel <BRTI.NS> would be announcing its January-March results on Tuesday. "Indian markets would continue to gain. Focus would be Modi and his track record first and earnings later," said Samir Arora, founder & fund manager at Helios Capital from Singapore. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> lost 0.32 percent, or 21.50 points, at 6,761.25, marking its lowest close since April 16 and retreating from a record high of 6,869.85 hit on Friday. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> fell 0.25 percent, or 56.46 points, to 22,631.61, its lowest close since April 17, and below its all-time high of 22,939.31 hit on Friday. Recent outperforming blue chips retreated, with Larsen & Toubro ending down 1.6 percent after gaining 4.7 over the previous two weeks. Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd <HDFC.NS> lost 1.1 percent. ACC Ltd <ACC.NS> fell 1.8 percent, adding to Friday's 2.73 percent drop, while Ambuja Cements India Ltd <ABUJ.NS> closed 4.3 percent lower after slumping 4.4 percent in the previous session on continued disappointment over their quarterly earnings last week. [ID:nL3N0NH15Q] Bharti Airtel Ltd <BRTI.NS> fell 1.2 percent on caution ahead of its January-March earnings due on Tuesday. However, among stocks that gained, Fulford India Ltd <FULF.BO>, a domestic subsidiary of Merck & Co Inc <MRK.N>, jumped 20 percent to its maximum daily limit, after it approved a delisting offer from its parent company. [ID:nL3N0NK0VL] Agrichemicals and pesticides firm UPL Ltd <UPLL.NS> ended higher 20 percent after marking its highest level since its demerger from Uniphos Enterprises Ltd <UNPH.NS> in January 2004.
