LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - European equities bounced back in early trading on Monday, with  AstraZeneca <AZN.L> surging after U.S. drugmaker Pfizer <PFE.N> confirmed it made a bid approach for Britain's second biggest drugs group.

AstraZeneca shares climbed 15 percent after Pfizer said it made an approach in January and contacted the company again on April 26 seeking to renew discussions about a takeover. A Pfizer bid for AstraZeneca would be one of the largest ever pharmaceuticals deals.
