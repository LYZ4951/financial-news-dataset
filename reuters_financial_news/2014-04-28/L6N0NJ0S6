MADRID, April 28 (Reuters) - Leading Spanish bank Santander <SAN.MC>, is expected to post a 12.5 percent rise in first-quarter net profit from a year ago, according to the averaged forecasts of nine analysts, even though revenues may drop slightly.

Santander, also the biggest bank in the euro zone by market value, makes most of its profit outside its home market, with around half net income provided by Latin America.  Currency fluctuations in emerging markets and depreciating local currencies against the euro could drag down the bank's revenues in euros in the first three months of 2014, analysts said.  Santander's net interest income (NII), or earnings on loans minus funding costs, was expected to fall 0.5 percent from a year ago to 6.62 billion euros ($9 billion) in the first quarter, the Reuters poll of analysts showed.  That would be a 5.4 percent improvement on the last three months of 2013, however. Some Spanish peers posted rising quarterly NII last week, helped by falling deposit costs in the country. Santander was seen posting a 1.36-billion-euro net profit in the first quarter. The bank is expected to book gains in the period from selling 85 percent of its real estate management unit Altamira to Apollo Global Management.   Santander is due to report earnings on April 29.
