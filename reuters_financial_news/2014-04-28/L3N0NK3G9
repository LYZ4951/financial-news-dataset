BANGALORE, April 28 (Reuters) - A drop in excess liquidity in the euro zone will not push money market rates higher as banks will borrow more from the European Central Bank's weekly refinancing operations, a Reuters poll of traders found.

Excess liquidity - the money banks hold in excess of their daily operational needs - fell to around 86 billion euros <ECBNOMLIQ=> on Monday, according to Reuters calculations, a level last seen just before the ECB offered three-year crisis loans to banks in December 2011. Sixteen of 19 traders said pressure on money market rates would eventually subside with banks expected to borrow more at the ECB's weekly tenders. The other three said falling excess liquidity would push the Euro Overnight Index Average rate (EONIA) <EONIA=> higher. The euro zone overnight bank-to-bank lending rate settled at 0.33 percent on Friday, 8 basis points above the European Central Bank's main refinancing rate, and just 3 basis points shy of this year's highs. The poll showed the ECB will lend 130 billion euros at its regular weekly operation and 5.6 billion euros in a 3-month tender, both slightly higher than the amounts maturing this week. Banks are also expected to repay 6.5 billion euros of the longer-term loans next week, lower than 9.6 billion euros they will return this week. ----------------------------------------------------------------   ALLOTMENT   THREE-MONTH   ONE-WEEK   LTRO ----------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN 130.0 5.6   MEAN   131.4 7.3   MODE   125.0 5.0   HIGHEST200.020.0   LOWEST 100.0 4.0   COUNT 23  22 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   THREE-YEAR LTRO REPAYMENTS   FIRST LTRO  SECOND LTRO   ----------------------------------------------------------------  MEDIAN 3.5   3.0MEAN   3.4   2.8MODE   4.0   4.0HIGHEST6.0   5.0LOWEST 0.4   0.2COUNT   2121   ----------------------------------------------------------------  GUIDE TO EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCEMENTS <ECBMENU> ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ECB OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS <ECB15>
