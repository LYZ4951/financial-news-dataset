MUMBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - Shares in India's IDFC Ltd <IDFC.NS> fell as much as 3.2 percent on Monday after the infrastructure lender's January-March quarter net profit halved, lagging consensus estimates.

IDFC reported March-quarter consolidated net profit of 2.58 billion rupees ($42.54 million), compared to 5.26 billion rupees last year, on the back of a jump in provisions and contingencies. [ID:nWNBS00FOC]
