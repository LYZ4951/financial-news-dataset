MILAN, April 28 (Reuters) - Alitalia's top creditors, banks Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, are willing to convert debt worth 400 million euros ($553 million) into shares in the airline to facilitate a deal with Gulf-based peer Etihad Airways, a source close to the matter said.

However, the banks want the Italian government to do its part and help ease a possible 49 percent investment by Etihad into the loss-making Italian carrier, the source said.
