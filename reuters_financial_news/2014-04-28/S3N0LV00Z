STOCKHOLM, April 28 (Reuters) - Swedish banking group Swedbank <SWEDa.ST> on Monday posted a first-quarter net profit that was in line with forecasts but said events in Ukraine could delay an anticipated increase in credit demand.

Net profit for continuing operations rose to 3.98 billion Swedish crowns ($607 million), just beating a mean forecast for 3.96 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts and compared with 3.66 billion in the year-ago period. The Swedish bank said it had seen good customer activity and a favourable stock market climate that impacted business positively in the quarter.
