FRANKFURT, April 28 (Reuters) - A new strategy to be unveiled by Siemens <SIEGn.DE> on May 7 will include thousands of job cuts, Germany's Manager Magazin Online reported on Monday, citing several senior Siemens managers.

It said the strategy would see Siemens' four main divisions - Industry, Energy, Healthcare and Infrastructure & Cities - dismantled, creating a flatter hierarchy and resulting in job cuts of roughly between 5,000-10,000. It also said Siemens would announce an acquisition in the energy sector worth at least 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion), separate to the deal with Alstom <ALSO.PA> currently being considered by Siemens.
