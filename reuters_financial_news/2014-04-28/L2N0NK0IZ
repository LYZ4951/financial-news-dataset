WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Monday proposed to raise fees banks have to pay to fund the agency, as the regulatory burden increases after the crisis.

The OCC said it had published a so-called notice of proposed rulemaking, requesting comments from the industry.
