BOSTON, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security advised computer users to consider using alternatives to Microsoft Corp's <MSFT.O> Internet Explorer browser until the company fixes a security flaw that  hackers have used to launch attacks.

The United States Computer Emergence Readiness Team said in an advisory released on Monday morning that the vulnerability in versions 6 to 11 of Internet Explorer "could lead to the complete compromise of an affected system." News of the vulnerability surfaced over the weekend.
