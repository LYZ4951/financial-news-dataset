PARIS, April 28 (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande said on Monday the state had an important role in deciding the future of power and transport engineering firm Alstom <ALSO.PA> and any successful bid would need to safeguard jobs and industrial activity in France.

"The state naturally has to have its say because it makes orders," Hollande said in a speech discussing the employment situation in France. "The key criteria is what will safeguard (industrial) activity and jobs in France."
