BEIJING, April 28 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished down 0.4 percent on Monday, with index heavyweight Tencent the biggest drag as investors worried that a clampdown on online video might affect its revenue.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.4 percent at 22,132.53. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was off 0.3 percent.  Shares in Tencent <0700.HK> fell 2.9 percent, after China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) banned four popular U.S. TV shows from being broadcast on online video streaming sites. [ID:nL3N0NK0JS] The ban is expected to signal a wider crackdown on foreign shows being aired on Chinese online platforms. Tencent's website says it operates China's biggest online video platform. Shares of Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd <0551.HK> rose 1.1 percent after the maker of footwear for brands including Nike Inc <NKE.N> and Adidas <ADSGn.DE> announced that more than 80 percent of workers who have been on strike at its Dongguan factory returned to work.
