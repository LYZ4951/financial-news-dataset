MELBOURNE, April 29 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open higher on Tuesday, testing six-year highs on optimism about U.S. growth after March housing numbers beat forecasts, but the top miners may cap gains after iron ore prices slid.

* Share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 0.4 percent to 5,554.0, a 17.9-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>. The benchmark inched up 0.1 percent on Monday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> ticked up 0.1 percent to 5,123.09 in early trade. * On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended higher on Monday after a volatile session, as gains in Apple <AAPL.O> and Pfizer <PFE.N> helped offset another round of selling in some high-growth tech shares. * Iron ore prices <.IO62-CNI=SI> dropped to a seven-week low below $110 a tonne, while nickel, copper and gold prices eased. Nickel retreated as worries abated about the severity of U.S. sanctions against Russia, the world no.2 nickel producer.  * Shares in Papua New Guinea oil and gas producer Oil Search Ltd <OSH.AX> may climb after its partner ExxonMobil Corp <XOM.N> announced exports from its PNG LNG (liquefied natural gas) project are due to start in a few weeks, about two months earlier than the market had expected. * Supermarkets-to-coal conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd <WES.AX> is due to report its third-quarter sales on Tuesday. * Whitehaven Coal <WHC.AX>, which last week cut its production guidance for the 2014 financial year, is due to report its third-quarter production. * Rail and ports operator Asciano Ltd <AIO.AX> is set to report quarterly volume results ahead of the market opening. * Indophil Resources <IRN.AX> is due to update the market on plans for its long-delayed Tampakan copper project in the Philippines in a quarterly report.----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2236 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1869.43  0.32% 6.030 USD/JPY <JPY=>   102.50.02% 0.020 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.7077  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1296.11  0.04% 0.510 US CRUDE<CLc1>   100.85   0.01% 0.010 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16448.74 0.53% 87.28 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  140.10  -0.07% -0.10 ------------------------------------------------------------- * S&P 500, Dow end up after late rebound  [.N]   * Brent crude tumbles as Libya exports rise  [O/R]   * Gold slides below $1,300 after strong US housing data [GOL/]   * Nickel slips on "mild" Russia sanctions  [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB]   (Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471  4234) DIARIES & DATA:  IPO diary & data  <AU/IPOMENU>  Asia earnings diary [ASIA/EQTY]  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]  European diary   [WEU/EQTY]  Australia diary  [AU/DIARY] Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
