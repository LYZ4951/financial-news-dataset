WARSAW, Apr 28 (Reuters) - Polish lender mBank <MBK.WA> reported a 4-percent rise in its first-quarter net profit, in line with market forecasts, as higher fees offset lower interest income revenues, it said on Monday.

The German Commerzbank's <CBKG.DE> unit said its net profit stood at 338 million zlotys ($111.1 million) compared with 334 million expected by analysts.
