DUBAI, April 28 (Reuters) - HSBC Bank Oman <HBOM.OM>, an affiliate of HSBC Holdings <HSBA.L>, posted a 46 percent slump in net profit in the first quarter, as the lender didn't repeat gains registered in the same period last year.

Oman's fourth-largest lender by assets made a net profit of 3.1 million rials ($8.1 million) in the opening three months of 2014, compared to 5.7 million rials in the same period of 2013, according to a bourse filing on Monday. HSBC Bank Oman said the fall was because the corresponding quarter in 2013 had been boosted by "large recoveries, release of a portion of the general provision and earnings from one-off fees". Estimates from Gulf Baader Capital Markets and United Securities had forecast a net profit for the period of 2.27 million and 3.58 million rials respectively. [ID:nL6N0N01QX] HSBC Bank Oman said earlier this month that it had agreed to sell its Indian business to Qatar's Doha Bank <DOBK.QA> for an undisclosed amount, with the transaction set to close in the second quarter.
