SINGAPORE, April 28 (Reuters) - Singapore shares started the week on a low note on Monday, weighed down by increasing tensions in Ukraine and after a dismal week in Wall Street, while shares of Capitaland Ltd <CATL.SI> slipped after the company's weak earnings.

The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> eased 0.2 percent to 3,260.38, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was flat. [MKTS/GLOB] Shares of CapitaLand, Southeast Asia's largest property developer, slipped 0.6 percent after its first-quarter profit dropped 1.7 percent due mainly to lacklustre sales from its Singapore unit, the company said on Friday. [ID:nL3N0NH18F] Brokerage OCBC kept its "buy" rating on CapitaLand's stock despite the weaker earnings, saying it expected the run-rate to pick up as the group pushes to sell its remaining inventory by adjusting prices at slower projects. The brokerage left the target price unchanged at S$3.79. Among other stocks, Wilmar International Ltd <WLIL.SI> edged down slightly after the company made a takeover bid for food firm Goodman Fielder <GFF.AX>, which the Australian company rejected as undervalued.
