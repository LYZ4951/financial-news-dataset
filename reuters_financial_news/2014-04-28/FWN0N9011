LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca <AZN.L> urged its shareholders to take no action over the approach by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc <PFE.N> on Monday and said it remained confident in its independent strategy.

Pfizer said earlier on Monday it had made a 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion) bid approach to AstraZeneca in January and had contacted its British rival again on April 26 seeking further discussions about a takeover. "In this discussion, the Chairman of Pfizer did not make a specific proposal regarding an offer to acquire AstraZeneca," Astra said. The British company said it had considered the request for talks, but without a specific and attractive proposal, it had deemed it inappropriate to engage in discussions with Pfizer.
