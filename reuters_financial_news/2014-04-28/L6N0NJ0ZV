MADRID, April 28 (Reuters) - Banco Popular <POP.MC>, Spain's fifth biggest bank by market value, is expected to report first-quarter net profit dropped by almost half compared to a year earlier, as some analysts believed the lender took charges on soured debts during the period.

Popular is forecast to post 55 million euros ($76 million) in net income for the first three months of 2014, according to the averaged estimates of nine analysts in a Reuters poll, down from 104 million euros the previous year. Estimates varied widely, however, with some researchers factoring in bigger provisions against bad debts than others. Like Spanish peers, Popular is still recovering from a prolonged property market slump and an economic downturn that left it with bad debts. Some rivals such as Sabadell <SABE.MC> and Caixabank <CABK.MC> said last week their bad loans as a percentage of credit had dropped in the first quarter, as the economic outlook improves in Spain. Analysts will also be looking for signs of a core revenue turnaround at Popular. The bank is expected to post net interest income, or earnings on loans minus funding costs, of 581 million euros, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Popular is due to report first-quarter earnings on April 30.
