MANILA, April 28 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Monday the United States will impose additional sanctions on Russia targeting individuals and companies over the crisis in Ukraine, a move expected to be followed by separate sanctions from the European Union.

Washington said at the weekend the new sanctions would target individuals and companies close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as new restrictions on high-tech exports to Russia's defence industry.
