April 28 (Reuters) - As the final hour of trading progresses, the Dow and S&P are both holding their heads above water, and the Nasdaq is now clinging to a fractional gain.

Technology <.SPLRCT>, up nearly three-quarters of a percent, and consumer staples <.SPLRCS>, up 1.2 percent, are now leading the way higher. Financials <.SPSY> remain the laggards, led lower by Bank of America's <BAC.N> 6.2 percent drop. Index snapshot at 3:16 p.m.:  * S&P 500 <.SPX> up 0.24 percent * Dow industrials <.DJI> up 0.55 percent * Nasdaq Composite  <.IXIC> up 0.07 percent * S&P e-mini <ESc1> volume is clocking in at an above-average 1.78 million contracts vs a 250-day average of 1.55 million.  From earlier in the day:  14:51 - Bank of America <BAC.N> call options own three of the top 10 most-active call slots as of 2:30 p.m. and two strikes of the bank's puts rank among the busiest equity puts, CBOE data shows. The 6.3 percent drop in BofA shares to below $15 is also pummeling options pricing on the call side. The heaviest action is in the $16 calls expiring May 17. CBOE volume was 18,530 contracts at 2:30 ET, and consolidated volume registered 36,150. The calls plunged to 7 cents from 31 on Friday, a drop of 77 percent.  The $15 strikes expiring on May 2, down 80 percent, and $17 calls expiring on Jan. 17, 2015, down 39 percent, are also seeing heavy trading. On the put side, the $16 strikes expiring May 17 and $15 strikes expiring July 19 were among the CBOE's busiest. The $16 puts expiring May 17 more than tripled in price to $1.12 a contract, while the $15 strikes for July more than doubled to 73 cents. More widely, most equity benchmarks are well off the day's lows. Index snapshot at 2:46 p.m.:  * S&P 500 <.SPX> down 0.06 percent * Dow industrials <.DJI> up 0.19 percent * Nasdaq Composite  <.IXIC> down 0.53 percent  13:48 - Major equity averages are falling further, losing more ground after Reuters, citing sources, reported that European Central Bank President Mario Draghi sees quantitative easing as still a ways away.  That's sparked a retreat from riskier assets, namely global equity averages, the dollar/yen, and growth stocks. The source says that Draghi believes low inflation remains an ongoing problem in the euro zone but sees no deflation scenario right now. The Nasdaq Composite is taking the brunt of the selling, with notable declines in stocks in the cloud computing, biotechnology and retail sectors.  Not all stocks are down, of course. Microsoft is higher again, building on last week's post-earnings gains, and defensive sectors - telecommunications and consumer staples names - are also in positive territory.  Index snapshot at 1:46 p.m.:  * S&P 500 <.SPX> down 0.58 percent * Dow industrials <.DJI> down 0.23 percent * Nasdaq Composite  <.IXIC> down 1.25 percent  13:21 - The Nasdaq Composite continues to fall, with Amazon Inc <AMZN.O> leading the way. Monday's decline of 4.7 percent decline drops shares to levels not seen since September of last year, extending a recent sell-off in shares.  The stock was trading at $289.51, down $14.21 a share. Since hitting a peak on Jan. 22, Amazon has lost 29 percent of its value, making it fourth-worst in the S&P 500 index so far this year. The shares fell 9.9 percent on Friday after Amazon  reported revenues that exceeded expectations, but investors soured on the stock after it said spending rose sharply. [ID:nL2N0NG26A] Amazon would seem to fit the model of what investors would lump in with a number of other high-growth stocks dubbed "momentum" stocks, but its trading volume has been modest compared with its heyday as a trading-crowd favorite in the late 1990s, when 20 million to 30 million shares would change hands on a daily basis. Over the past 50 days, it has averaged about 4.6 million shares a day.  StarMine, a unit of Thomson Reuters, believes the stock has a long way to go to be fairly valued, putting its intrinsic value (a measure of its projected growth over the coming decade) at roughly $33 a share. It's not likely to fall that far, but options traders are taking big new positions in put options expiring Friday that bet on the stock falling to $275 or $270 a share by week's end. Earlier gains in U.S. indexes have vanished: * S&P 500 <.SPX> down 0.45 percent * Dow industrials <.DJI> down 0.01 percent * Nasdaq Composite  <.IXIC> down 1.28 percent12:22 - Most indexes are flat or in the red as the strike of noon passes with banks the biggest drag courtesy of a 5 percent drop in Bank of America <BAC.N> shares. The No. 2 U.S. bank will suspend a planned increase in its quarterly dividend as well as its latest stock buyback program because it miscalculated a measure of the capital on its books. [ID:nL3N0NK4HT] BofA shares are down by the most in a day since a 7.1 percent drop on Nov. 7, 2012, and have breached a key technical support level, dropping below their 200-day moving average for the first time since August 2012. Index snapshot at 12:20: * S&P 500 <.SPX> up 0.05 percent * Dow industrials <.DJI> up 0.41 percent * Nasdaq Composite  <.IXIC> down 0.61 percent * S&P Midcap 400 <.IDX> down 0.55 percent * S&P Smallcap 600 <.SPCY> down 0.86 percent  11:38 - The earnings season is near the halfway point with first-quarter numbers now in from 49 percent of S&P 500 members, and the beat rate is higher than average, data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S shows. Of the 247 companies in the index that have reported earnings, 67.2 percent have topped analysts' expectations vs the long-term average of 63 percent.  It's notable that the miss rate is also a bit higher than usual: 21.9 percent vs the typical 21 percent. Meanwhile, 10.9 percent of the numbers are in line with forecasts vs the 17 percent seen over the long haul. The tenor of earnings overall has improved, too. The Thomson Reuters numbers show the Q1 2014 blended EPS growth estimate is now a 3.3 percent gain from a year ago. Earlier this month it had dropped below 1 percent. Sales are on pace for a 2.7 percent gain, with 53.7 percent of S&P companies exceeding forecasts. That is a bit softer than average, however, with 61 percent reporting a top-line beat in the average quarter. Earlier gains in U.S. indexes are eroding as the 11:30 a.m. mark approaches: * S&P 500 <.SPX> up 0.21 percent * Dow industrials <.DJI> up 0.47 percent * Nasdaq Composite  <.IXIC> down 0.13 percent  11:01 - The S&P health sector <.SPXHC> is making a bid to regain the No. 2 spot in the year-to-date performance rankings of the S&P 500's 10 economic sectors with a 1.2 percent gain in Monday's mid-morning action. The gains are being led by a 4.7 percent rise in Pfizer <PFE.N> shares after news of its takeover approach to Britain's AstraZeneca <AZN.L>. [ID:nL6N0NK194] Gilead <GILD.O> is a strong second with a 3 percent gain in a rebound of biotech shares. Health, which had been the top performing sector through the first two months of the year, was overtaken in mid-March by utilities <.SPLRCU> and then ceded the second spot to energy <.SPNY> about two weeks ago.  With Monday's gain, though, it has narrowed the gap and now trails energy by just 50 basis points on year-to-date price performance: Energy is up 4.95 percent and health is up 4.45 percent.  Even with Monday's lackluster showing, utilities remain well ahead of both, up 13.4 percent this year. Toss in the group's juicy dividend yield and the gain approaches 14.5 percent on a total return basis <.TRGSPU>.  10:26 - Pending home sales for March notch their biggest rise in nearly two years at 3.4 percent over February's reading <USNCH=ECI><USNAR=ECI>.  March's pending home sales index clocks in at the highest since November, rebounding from a February level that was the lowest in more than two years. [ID:nW1N0K3004] Home builders' stocks are higher in the wake of the data: The Dow Jones U.S. Homebuilders Index <.DJUSHB> is up 2.6 percent on the day with nearly all of the move coming after the numbers hit at 10:00 a.m. The index is now 4.5 percent higher over the past four days, recovering further from a four-month low set last week. All seven index members are higher, lead by Lennar's <LEN.N> 3.5 percent rise. The S&P, Dow and Nasdaq all remain at least two-thirds of a percent higher on the day. The Nasdaq 100 <.NDX> just crossed over the 1 percent marker.  10:00 - The Dow <.DJI> is outperforming in early trading after the opening bell, with IBM's <IBM.N> 2 percent gain leading the charge.  Pfizer's <PFE.N> also a top contributor to the index's 0.54 percent rise, with the drug maker's shares up 3 percent on news of its bold merger approach to AstraZeneca <AZN.L>. The S&P 500 <.SPX> is up around 0.33 percent and Nasdaq <.IXIC> is posting a 0.3 percent gain. Large-cap is generally outpacing small, with the S&P 100 <.OEXA> up 0.43 percent vs the Russell 2000's <.RUT> 0.18 percent rise.  09:00 - Monday's economic data calendar is light, with pending home sales for March from the National Association of Realtors the only indicator scheduled <ECONUSTODAY>. The index is expected to rise 1 percent from February's two-plus year low. The report is due at 10 a.m. ET and will keep the underperforming home building group in the spotlight. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF <XHB.P> is down 6.7 percent year to date vs a gain of just under 1 percent for the S&P 500.   08:54 - Pfizer <PFE.N> is among the top movers in the early going, up nearly 6 percent at $31.30 in premarket action vs. a $30.75 close.  The Dow component has pitched a takeover offer for British rival AstraZeneca Plc <AZN.L> worth nearly $100 billion and is weighing its next move in the approach after its first two bids were rejected. [ID:nL6N0NK194] AstraZeneca's U.S.-traded shares are up more than 16 percent at nearly $80 in premarket trading.  Pfizer's move follows a spate of deal activity across the health and pharma sector. Last week Zimmer <ZMH.N> agreed to buy Biomet for $13.4 billion, while over the weekend Reuters reported exclusively that Merck <MRK.N> is in talks to sell its consumer unit for nearly $14 billion. [ID:nL3N0NG3TQ][ID:nL6N0NI06U] In the deals-gone-sour department, Newmont Mining <NEM.N> is down close to 6 percent after merger talks with Canada's Barrick Gold <ABX.TO> were terminated.

On the wider market, index futures' gains are eroding, with the S&P e-minis <ESc1> now up just 3.75 points vs nearly 7 earlier.   08:32 - U.S. index futures are all higher Monday morning with more drug-sector M&A activity acting as the main driver. * S&P 500 e-minis <ESc1> are up 6 points, about 0.32 percent, with just under 145,000 contracts traded. * Nasdaq 100s <NDc1> are up 0.27 percent, or 9.75 points, though volume is miniscule at just 79 contracts.
