WARSAW, April 28 (Reuters) - Poland's central bank management board member Andrzej Raczko said that the latest zloty movement poses no threat for the Polish economy.

"The zloty fluctuations we saw lately are not big and do not destabilize the economy," Raczko said in an interview with Dziennik Gazeta Prawna daily published on Monday.
