SEOUL, April 28 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> rose the most in nearly three weeks on Monday on demand from exporters for month-end settlements and on short covering by offshore funds.

The local currency <KRW=KFTC> was quoted at 1,035.0 against the dollar at the end of onshore trade, up 0.6 percent from Friday's close at 1,041.5. That was its biggest daily percentage gain since a 1 percent rise on April 9.
