JERUSALEM, April 28 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel kept interest rates unchanged on Monday. [ID:nS8N0ML004]

It released a statement after the decision, including the following highlights:  Background conditions:   Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation projections for the next 12 CPI readings declined slightly this month, to 1.5 percent on average. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market also declined slightly, to 1.5 percent, and expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates increased by 0.2 percentage points to 1.4 percent. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms did not change markedly this month, and remain slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Based on private forecasters' projections, as well as the Telbor interest rates and the makam curve, no change in the Bank of Israel interest rate is expected in the coming months.   Real economic activity: Data that became available this month indicate that in the first quarter there was some acceleration in the expansion of the economy, led by domestic demand and services exports, and with a virtual standstill in goods exports. In the third estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2013, the upward revision of GDP and business sector product continued. GDP growth was revised to 3.2 percent, and the business sector product growth rate was revised to 2.7 percent (seasonally adjusted, annual terms). Foreign trade data indicate that goods exports (excluding ships and aircraft and diamonds, seasonally adjusted) remained almost unchanged in the first quarter of the year, and excluding pharmaceuticals exports, which registered an atypical increase, goods exports declined by 6 percent in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2013.The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on March 23, 2014, through April 25, 2014, the shekel appreciated by 0.3 percent against the dollar and weakened by 0.1 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel weakened by about 0.4 percent this month. For the year to date, the effective exchange rate has remained essentially unchanged (appreciation of 0.2 percent), and has appreciated by 4.5 percent over the past 12 months.   The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on March 23, 2014, through April 25, 2014, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 0.2 percent, while there were increases on most markets worldwide. Government bond yields increased along the curves. 10-year unindexed bonds traded almost unchanged, at a yield of 3.4 percent.   The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) increased by 0.9 percent in March. In the 12 months ending in March, this component increased by 3.2 percent, similar to the rate over the 12 months ending in February (3.1 percent). Home prices, which are measured in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.6 percent in January-February. Over the 12 months ending in February, prices increased by 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 7.2 percent in the 12 months ended in January. The stock of unsold (private initiative) homes declined in February. In the 12 months ended in January, there were 42,700 building starts and 42,600 building completions. In February, the number of transactions declined, without a major change in the distribution between first-home buyers, homeowners upgrading their residences, and investors.  The main considerations behind the decision   The decision to keep the interest rate for May 2014 unchanged at 0.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel.   The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:   The CPI for the month of March increased by 0.3 percent, and inflation over the preceding 12 months was 1.3 percent. Inflation expectations for one year ahead remain within the target range, below the midpoint of the range.  Data which became available this month indicate that in the first quarter there was some acceleration in the expansion of the economy, led by domestic demand and services exports, and with a virtual standstill in goods exports. Labor Force Survey data continue to indicate a decline in unemployment and an increase in employment. The number of employee posts of Israelis increased relatively sharply in January, primarily in domestic-market oriented industries, but there are no indications of wage increases, and the growth rate of health tax receipts remains moderate.  In the past month, the shekel weakened by 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, while the effective exchange rate has remained stable for the year to date, and has appreciated by 4.5 percent over the past year.  This month, the IMF slightly reduced its global growth and world trade volume forecasts, both by 0.1 percent, primarily against the background of a decline in the forecast for economic activity in emerging markets. Positive data were published in the US and Europe this month. In the US, the Fed is expected to only begin increasing the federal funds rate in the second half of 2015, and there are assessments that in Europe, additional accommodative monetary policy measures will be adopted. Emerging market economies remain weak.  Home prices continued to increase this month, and their annual rate of increase is around 6-7 percent. The rate of mortgages taken out remains elevated, while there is stabilization, at a lower level, in the risk characteristics of new mortgages. There is continued uncertainty regarding the effect on price levels and activity volume of the policy measures which were decided upon.   The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ______________________ The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for May 2014 will be published on May 12, 2014. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2014 will be published at 16:00 on Monday, May 26, 2014.  Keywords: ISRAEL RATES/
