FRANKFURT, April 28 (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse <DB1Gn.DE> posted a forecast-beating 72 percent rise in operating profit in the first quarter, thanks to a one-off gain and rising revenue, the German exchange operator said on Monday.

Quarterly earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) was 330 million euros ($456.87 million) compared with an average expectation of 261 million euros in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages. [ID:nL6N0NG3IS] Deutsche Boerse had a one-off gain of 63 million euros in the quarter from the merger of stock exchanges Direct Edge -- in which Deutsche Boerse held a stake -- and BATS in January.
