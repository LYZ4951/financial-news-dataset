FRANKFURT, April 28 (Reuters) - The euro zone has made encouraging progress after facing the risk of break-up two years ago but this "does not mean we are entirely out of the danger zone", European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said on Monday.

"We have certainly turned a corner and stabilised the situation," he said in the text of a speech for delivery in Frankfurt. "(But)... it is too soon to declare that the crisis is over." Constancio said the euro zone still faces major challenges in terms of lacklustre growth, excessive unemployment and significant financial fragmentation - or uneven financial conditions. He was speaking at a joint ECB and European Commission conference on financial integration. Earlier, they issued a report showing differences between financial markets in Europe are still greater than before the financial crisis, despite unprecedented measures for closer integration.

Euro zone inflation is running at 0.5 percent - far below the ECB's medium-term target of just below 2 percent. Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi gave his clearest indication yet that the central bank could print money to buy assets if inflation slows, and identified a rise in the euro as a potential trigger for action. [ID:nL6N0NG2QJ] Euro zone inflation data for April, due on Wednesday, could be important for the ECB's policy stance. ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said last week a lower-than-expected April reading could trigger policy action. [ID:nF9N0NG001]
