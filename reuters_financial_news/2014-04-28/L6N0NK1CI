LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Private equity group Arle Capital said on Monday it had agreed to acquire Innovia Group, a British maker of materials to be used in England's new five and ten pound notes, for an enterprise value of 498 million euros ($689.11 million).

Innovia was previously owned by the Candover 2001 fund, which Arle has managed since 2009. Candover investors <CDI.L> will receive a return of more than twice their original investment, Arle said. Arle said it had raised fresh capital to fund the transaction from a syndicate of global investors. Electra Private Equity <ELTA.L> investment said on Monday it had invested 40 million euros in the buyout.
