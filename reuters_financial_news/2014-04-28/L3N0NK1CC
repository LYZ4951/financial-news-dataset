JAKARTA, April 28 (Reuters) - PT Bank Central Asia <BBCA.JK>, Indonesia's biggest bank by market value, reported on Monday a 27 percent rise in first-quarter net profit compared to the same period last year, lifted by strong loan demand from large corporations.

The bank posted a net profit of 3.7 trillion rupiah ($319.94 million) for the three months ended March.
