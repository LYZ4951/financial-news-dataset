MADRID, April 28 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest bank, BBVA <BBVA.MC>, is expected to post first-quarter profit down by more than half from a year ago, according to a Reuters poll, after the first three months of 2013 were boosted by gains from asset sales.

The lender, which makes most of its profit outside Spain and relies on Mexico as a key income driver, is seen reporting revenue of 5.32 billion euros ($7.36 billion) in the first quarter of 2014, the averaged forecasts of eight analysts polled by Reuters showed.  That would be a 1.8 percent drop from a year ago. Like its peer Santander, BBVA is exposed to depreciating Latin American currencies, and analysts expected this to weigh on its revenues in euros. BBVA is however expected to post a slight improvement in net interest income, or earnings on loans minus deposit costs, compared to a year ago. Its net profit for the quarter is forecast to come in at 715 million euros. BBVA is due to report earnings on April 30.
