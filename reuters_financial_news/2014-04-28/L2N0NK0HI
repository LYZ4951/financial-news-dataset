WASHINGTON, April 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday said Bank of America had to redo a capital plan it had submitted as part of the Fed's annual stress tests, and that it told the bank to suspend any raises in shareholder capital distribution.

Bank of America had disclosed it had incorrectly reported data used in the calculation of regulatory capital ratios, and submitted those as inputs for the stress tests, the Fed said. The bank had to resubmit its capital plan within 30 days, and correct the errors, but the Fed said it could still extend that period.
