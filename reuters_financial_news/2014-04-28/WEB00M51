ZURICH, April 28 (Reuters) - Swiss cement maker Holcim <HOLN.VX> said there is considerable interest from industry players and private equity for assets it must sell ahead of its merger with France's Lafarge <LAFP.PA>.

Holcim announced a deal three weeks ago to merge with France's Lafarge and is expected to sell some 5 billion euros ($6.85 billion) of assets to persuade competition regulators to allow the tie-up to go ahead.  "There is huge (...) market interest," Chief Executive Bernard Fontana told a conference call on Monday, adding the company had seen interest from across the industry, including players in mature and emerging markets as well as private equity.
