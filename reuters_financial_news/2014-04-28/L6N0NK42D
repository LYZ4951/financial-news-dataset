LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Russian debt insurance costs fell on Monday after a fresh round of U.S. sanctions on Russia were not as stringent as the market anticipated, while Ukraine's five-year credit default swaps hit two-month highs.

The United States on Monday imposed sanctions against seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in its latest action to punish Moscow for its intervention in Ukraine.

"This is a very sanction 'lite' approach."  Russia's 5-year credit default swaps fell 19 basis points from Friday's close to 265 bps, according to Markit, after hitting Nov 2011 highs earier on Monday.
