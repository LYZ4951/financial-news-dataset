STOCKHOLM, April 28 (Reuters) - Swedish investment firm Kinnevik <KINVb.ST> said on Monday its first quarter net asset value rose 16 percent to 66.2 billion Swedish crowns ($10.05 billion) from a year earlier and said a sharp increase in smartphone use had positively affected its old and new holdings.

The investment company, a major investor in the telecoms industry and Germany's Zalando - Europe's biggest online fashion firm, said earlier this month it had picked board member and former Goldman Sachs banker Lorenzo Grabau as chief executive. [ID:nL6N0MZ142]
