NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set for a higher open on Monday, rebounding from a decline in the previous session, amid merger and acquisition activity in the pharmaceuticals sector.

* U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc <PFE.N> is working on its next move in a potential $100 billion bid to take over Britain's AstraZeneca Plc <AZN.L> after two earlier bids were rejected. [ID:nL6N0NK194] * Pfizer made a 58.8 billion pounds ($98.9 billion) bid to AstraZeneca in January and said it had contacted its British rival again on April 26 to further discuss a takeover, which would be one of the biggest ever in the pharmaceuticals industry. * Forest Laboratories Inc <FRX.N> said it would buy Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc <FURX.O> for up to $1.46 billion, including milestone payments to access Furiex's promising treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. [ID:nL3N0NK3PM] * Furiex Pharmaceuticals shares jumped nearly 31 percent in premarket trading while Forest Laboratories shares rose 2.3 percent.  * Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> said it would suspend a $4 billion stock buyback program and a planned increase in its quarterly dividend after it miscalculated the treatment of certain structured notes related to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch in 2009. The company also said it would resubmit its 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. [ID:L3N0NK41L] * Bank of America shares were down 4 percent in premarket trading. * Charter Communications Inc <CHTR.O> reported a 15 percent jump in first-quarter revenue due to a rise in the number of residential video subscribers.
