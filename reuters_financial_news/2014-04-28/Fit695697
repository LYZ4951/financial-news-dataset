April 28 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AAA'(EXP) rating with  Stable Outlook to Bank of Montreal <BMO.TO> (BMO; 'AA-'/Outlook Stable/'F1+') inaugural  series of global registered covered bonds issued under its newly established  legislative program.  Fitch's expected rating takes into account a hypothetical  EUR-denominated jumbo issuance with a soft bullet maturity of up to seven years. KEY RATING DRIVERS Rating Rationale: The expected 'AAA' rating on BMO's legislative mortgage  covered bonds is based on BMO's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-',  a Discontinuity Cap (D-Cap) of 3 (Moderate High Risk) and an asset percentage  (AP) expected to be in line with Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven level of 93.5%.  Alternative Management Drives D-Cap: The D-Cap of 3 (moderate-high risk) is  driven by Fitch's assessment of systemic alternative management which reflects  the significant roles being performed post issuer default by the trustee, acting  on behalf of the guarantor, which would likely seek bondholder approval for  major decisions and need to contract other parties to perform important  functions. This assessment is consistent across all Canadian mortgage covered  bond programs.  Cover Pool Credit Risk: The greatest contributor to the 'AAA' breakeven AP of  93.5% is the expected loss on the mortgage loans included in the initial cover  pool. As of March 2014, the pool consisted of 42,424 first lien residential  mortgage loans totaling CAD8.3 billion.  It had a weighted average (WA) original  combined loan-to-value (LTV) of 69.7%, a non-zero WA credit score of 751 and was  primarily concentrated in Ontario (44%).   In an 'AAA' scenario, Fitch calculated a cumulative WA probability of default  (PD) of 14.1%, a WA recovery rate (RR) of 55.2% and a WA expected loss of 7.8%,  which incorporates an additional 1.4% loss attributable to interest accrued on  defaulted loans from initial delinquency through liquidation.  RATING SENSITIVITIES BMO's covered bonds' rating would be vulnerable to a downgrade if: BMO's IDR  were to be downgraded to 'AA-' or lower; the D-Cap fell by at least two  categories to 1 (very high risk); or the program's contractual AP increased  above 93.5%.
