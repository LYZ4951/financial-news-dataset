FRANKFURT, April 28 (Reuters) - Shares in property group Buwog <BWOG.DE>, which is being spun off from Austrian Immofinanz <IMFI.VI>, rose in their market debut on Monday.

Trading of the shares started at 13 euros apiece, and the price edged up to 13.25 euros in early trading.  Earlier this year, Immofinanz shareholders approved a spin-off of an initial 51 percent of Buwog to separate the more conservative Buwog portfolio of German and Austria homes from Immofinanz' eastern European commercial assets.
