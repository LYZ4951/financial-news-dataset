LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Emerging market stock and bond funds saw their first inflows over the past week after over $50 billion fled in the first three months of 2014, with equities snapping a 22-week losing streak, data from EPFR Global shows.

The Boston-based fund tracker, which tracks funds with $23 trillion in assets, released details of first quarter flows late on Thursday, showing that all emerging equity fund categories had shed $41 billion, following $26.7 billion losses in 2013.  Global Emerging Markets (GEM) equity funds lost $20 billion-plus in the first quarter, EPFR said, but it added that now "there were signs of a thaw". These funds received $2.5 billion in the week to April 2, with 95 percent of this taken in by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), EPFR said. China, India, Russia and Brazil, the four BRIC countries, enjoyed the biggest inflows.  Only one emerging markets category tracked by EPFR - frontier equity funds - finished the quarter with net gains, having taken in $815 million, data showed. Developed equity funds which took in a record-setting $385 billion inflows last year, absorbed $95.6 billion over the quarter. Western European equity funds outpaced the United States and Japan, taking in $31.5 billion, EPFR said. Emerging debt funds meanwhile received just over $1 billion in the past week, EPFR said, noting that the funds had posted outflows in 12 of the 13 weeks in the first 2014 quarter. First quarter losses amounted to $17.2 billion. It said that flows into China bond funds one of the few bright spots in emerging markets had also faltered following a domestic corporate default. European bond funds continued to fly high, taking in $15.7 billion in the first quarter, outstripping last year's record $12 billion inflow. U.S. bond funds received $28.2 billion "Flows through March were shaped to a degree by the low rates of headline inflation in the United States and Europe, with some fund managers arguing that the latter is flirting with outright deflation," EPFR said.
