April 4 (Reuters) - Kentz Corporation Ltd <KENZ.L>, a British engineer focused on the energy sector, said Meg Lassarat would replace Ed Power as chief financial officer.

Lassarat was most recently the CFO of Houston-based engineering and field services company UniversalPegasus International. She would take on the role after Power steps down on May 29 upon reaching the normal retirement age. Power would stay on through August to facilitate a smooth transition, Kentz said. [ID:nRSD0150Ea]
