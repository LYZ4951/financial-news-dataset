MUMBAI, April 4 (Reuters) - Indian shares posted their biggest fall in a month, ending down for a second consecutive session and continuing to retreat from a record high hit in the previous session as investors pared positions in blue chips such as Reliance Industries <RELI.NS>.

Caution is setting in ahead of the start of a five-week election process on Monday, while the U.S. jobs monthly data later in the day could impact global markets. Reliance Industries provisionally fell 0.9 percent, while Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS> lost 1 percent.
