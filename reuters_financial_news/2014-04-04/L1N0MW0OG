NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - A lawsuit accusing Lululemon Athletica Inc <LULU.O> of defrauding shareholders by hiding defects in its yoga pants should be dismissed, a U.S. judge has concluded, in a case that involved a costly recall.

In a draft decision released on Friday, U.S. District Judge Katharine Forrest in Manhattan rejected claims the Canadian company cost investors roughly $2 billion by having concealed problems in manufacturing and marketing its yoga pants. Forrest on Friday also issued a draft decision that dismissed a separate lawsuit seeking to hold 13 current and former Lululemon executives and directors liable for mismanagement.
