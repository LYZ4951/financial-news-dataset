PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - France's Vivendi <VIV.PA> said its board would continue to work this weekend to evaluate the two offers it had received for its SFR telecom unit, which has been the subject of a month-long bidding war.

Numericable <NUME.PA> and Bouygues <BOUY.PA> are both vying to buy France's second-largest telecom operator in a deal that values the target at above 15 billion euros ($20.5 billion).
