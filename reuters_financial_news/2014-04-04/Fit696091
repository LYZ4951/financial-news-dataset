April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Southchester (RF) Limited's National Fund Credit Rating at 'AA+(zaf)' and National Fund Volatility Rating at 'V2(zaf)'. The fund is managed by Southchester Investment Managers (Proprietary) Limited (Southchester).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation of the National Fund Credit Rating is driven by the fund's high  and stable credit quality, as reflected in the fund's weighted average rating  factor (WARF) and rating distribution. The affirmation of the National Fund Volatility Rating is driven by the fund's  low exposure to interest rate risk and spread risk, as reflected in the fund's  short maturity profile, while recognising the fund's potential exposure to  longer dated securities through repurchase agreements.  ASSET CREDIT QUALITY The fund's weighted average credit quality is high, reflecting its investment  policies, which require that the portfolio invest 90% of its assets in  securities rated 'A(zaf)' or above. While the fund can have a limited exposure  to lower dated securities, this exposure is infrequent and limited in practical  terms. The fund's WARF of 0.13 as of February 2014 is consistent with a  'AAA(zaf)' National Fund Credit Rating. However, taking into consideration the  concentration risk in the fund and in line with Fitch's rating criteria the  agency has notched down the National Fund Credit Rating to 'AA+(zaf)'.   PORTFOLIO SENSITIVITY TO MARKET RISKS The fund has low exposure to interest rate risk, as reflected in the fund's  investment policies, which limit its weighted average maturity (WAM) to interest  rate reset date to 90 days. As of February 2014, the fund's WAM was 64 days.  Exposure to spread risk is also low, based on the fund's investment policies,  which limit the maximum maturity of individual assets to 1080 days and place  limits on the portfolio's weighted average life (WAL, i.e. maturity to final  maturity date) at 150 days (WAL of 104 days as of February 2014). The fund's  Market Risk Factor is consistent with a 'V1(zaf)' National Fund Volatility  Rating. However, the fund may invest in instruments not accessible to money  market funds in South Africa and its maturity profile is longer overall.  Therefore the agency believes that a 'V2(zaf)' National Fund Volatility Rating  best reflects the fund's overall market risk profile. The fund has suffered a pattern of heavy month-end redemptions followed by  subscriptions at the start of the next month. The fund has serviced all of these  redemptions through high natural liquidity (32% overnight) and thanks to its  investments in breakable (notice) bank deposits, other liquid money market  instruments and its use of reverse repo, which can temporarily help to boost  liquidity. The majority of the portfolio is liquid (Fitch estimates that 65% of  the portfolio matures in three months as of February 2014), which facilitates  secondary security disposals if necessary. The fund continues to diversify its  investor base, as evidenced by declining top investor and top-five investor  concentrations.  CONCENTRATION In Fitch's opinion, the fund is concentrated, with a top three issuer exposure  consistently in excess of 50% of portfolio holdings. In line with its applicable  rating criteria, Fitch typically adjusts the WARF-implied Fund Credit Rating of  funds it deems concentrated by one or more notches. Without concentration risk  this fund could achieve a 'AAA(zaf)' National Fund Credit Rating. The fund's concentrated holdings reflects its investment mandate and the  structural characteristics of the South African market, with a limited supply of  treasury bills, and the five largest banks having a combined market share of  around 90%, according to Fitch's estimates. Without structural evolution of the South African market that results in a more  diverse, high quality and liquid issuance market, it is highly unlikely that  Fitch could rate any money market fund higher than 'AA+(zaf)' in South Africa.  FUND PROFILE The fund's objective is to obtain as high a level of current income as is  consistent with capital preservation and liquidity. It aims to achieve this  through investing in a diversified portfolio of short-term debt instruments and  from time to time in participatory interests in collective investment schemes  (money market funds), which themselves primarily invest in similar debt  instruments. Structurally, the fund is a debenture issuing fixed income portfolio, regulated  under the Commercial Paper Exemption Notice 2172 as issued by the Registrar of  Banks in 1994 in terms of the Banks Act of 1990. It falls outside the Collective  Investment Schemes Control Act of 2012. The debentures have an initial maturity  of six years and can be redeemed by debenture holders daily, with a maximum T+2  settlement. The debentures rank pari passu among themselves and a negative  pledge exists over the issuer preventing it from engaging in any other  activities while any debentures remain outstanding. Economically, Fitch  considers Southchester directly comparable with a mutual fund. The fund had total assets under management (AUM) of ZAR4.0bn as of end-February  2014, although its assets have fluctuated between approximately ZAR1.4bn (in  June 2013) and the current amount over the past year.  THE ADVISOR Southchester is an independent asset manager founded towards the end of 2013. It  is licenced by South Africa's Financial Services Board with Financial Service  Provider (FSP) number 44868. The fund was previously managed by the same team  under Peregrine Fund Platform (Proprietary) Limited's asset management licence.  Southchester continues to insource record keeping, valuation and reporting  services from Peregrine under a service level agreement (SLA). It also insources  independent compliance monitoring services and credit research from third-party  providers, also under SLAs. The fund managers are Andra Greyling and Gregg  Bayly, who have 26 years and 18 years treasury and investment management  experience, respectively. The fund management team is unchanged between  Peregrine and Southchester. Additional oversight is provided by Societe Generale  Securities Services (Proprietary) Limited (a division of Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>;  A/Negative/F1) as custodian and trustee. To maintain bond fund ratings, Southchester and Societe Generale provide Fitch  with portfolio information, including details of the portfolio's holdings and  credit quality. Fitch closely monitors the credit composition of the portfolio,  the credit counterparties used by the manager and the overall market risk  profile of the investments.  RATING SENSITIVITY: The ratings assigned to this fund may be sensitive to material changes in the  credit quality or market risk profile of the fund. A material adverse deviation  from Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could cause ratings to be  downgraded. Specifically, Fitch would expect to downgrade the National Fund  Credit Rating in the event of deteriorating credit quality such that the fund's  weighted average rating factor exceeds 0.40, combined with a similar or  increased level of potential concentration risk. Fitch would expect to review  the fund's National Fund Credit Rating were it to include any securities rated  lower than the 'A(zaf)' rating category. Given the relatively short maturity  profile of the fund and the conservatism already built in to the National Fund  Volatility Rating, the rating is expected to be stable. However, should interest  rates or market volatility in South Africa structurally change, or the maturity  profile of the fund be materially extended, then Fitch would expect to downgrade  the National Fund Volatility Rating.
