April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of China Development Bank Corporation [CHDB.UL] (CDB), Agricultural Development Bank of China [AGDBC.UL] (ADBC), and Export-Import Bank of China <2544.HK> (ExIm) at 'A+' with Stable Outlook. The banks' Short-Term IDRs have also been affirmed at 'F1'. No Viability Ratings are assigned since they act as agents of state policy. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action  commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS AND SENIOR  DEBT The ratings, which are equivalent to that of China's sovereign, are based on an  extremely high probability of the central government supporting the banks in the  event of stress. This reflects the entities' important policy functions to  promote strategic development in China's economy, their 100% state ownership and  a long history of support from the central government for the banks. All three policy banks play an important role in national economic development,  including providing financing for domestic infrastructure projects and pillar  industries (by CDB); the procurement of agriculture goods and rural development  projects (by ADBC); and the growth of external trade (by ExIm). In addition to  these core policy functions, CDB and ExIm provide financing for strategic  overseas investments and resource purchases on behalf of the state.Reflecting their policy roles, the banks' asset growth, which is controlled by  the state, remains rapid in order to sustain China's economic growth and support  economic transformation. On average, about 85% of asset expansion since 2007 was  comprised of lending, which constitutes the largest share of total assets of all  three policy banks. Recent growth at ADBC and ExIm has been increasingly focused  on non-traditional policy lending, with nearly one-third of new credits going to  rural infrastructure development and concessional loans to foreign governments  on behalf of the state, respectively.   The entities' quasi-sovereign status is reflected in a zero risk weighting  applied to all bonds issued by the policy banks. China's banking regulator  recently announced the risk-weighting of bonds issued by CDB will remain zero at  least up to end-2015.   Even though it was announced in 2007 that the objective was to eventually  "commercialise" the policy banks, only CDB has been through the process; thus  far it has converted into a joint-stock company, introduced a new board of  directors and expanded the commercial areas of business. However, the  transformation has been largely on hold since the global crisis and there is no  tangible plan to restart it for policy banks in the foreseeable future.RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS, SUPPORT RATING FLOORS AND SENIOR  DEBT The IDRs of the three policy banks will move in tandem with the sovereign  ratings and changes in the perceived ability and/or willingness of the state to  support the banks. If future commercialisation were to lead to a material change  in banks' policy role, support mechanism, or relationship with the state,  downward revision of the Support Rating, Support Rating Floor, IDRs and senior  debt are possible.
