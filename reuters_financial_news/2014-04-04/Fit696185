ASRI ratings affirmation reflects small-scale enterprises, projects concentrated, and the cyclical nature inherent in the business of developing property.

Factors Supporting Rating Stability in Central Decreased Demand: ASRI plans to shift the focus development to the middle segment in 2014 to address the sentiment of buyers weakened due to more stringent regulations in force from 2013 and elections that will last until July 2014. Middle segment consists over more first home buyers, which was less affected than The new regulations. Fitch expects this strategy and the quality of ASRI project development can help achieve the appropriate credit profile epidemic in 2014. Nevertheless, the ratio of presales / gross debt is likely to approaching the limit of 0.75x (end of 2013: 1.05x), which can downgrade considered. Diversification is limited, but growing: ASRI presales grew by 50% to Rp 4.8 trillion in 2013. However, the company has scaled small compared to developers with a higher ranking.

ASRI is one of the pioneers in developing large-scale settlement in Serpong, which is now a popular alternative compared to other regions in Jabodetabek. Fitch expects ASRI will be able to take advantage of the success of project in Serpong to launch new projects, as has been demonstrated through the achievement of sales above market expectations on Thursday. Addressing the risk of exchange rate: ASRI has hedge the risk policy exchange rate over the principal amount of loans denominated in U.S. Dollars. company also targets for all times maintain cash reserves in U.S. Dollars enough for 3-4 times the coupon payment. Fitch believes this strategy can mitigate the risk of exchange rate but does not fully protect ASRI ASRI in case of extreme currency volatility.  sensitivity rating Negative: future developments that may, individually and collectively, triggering the decline include: -Rising debt ratios on an ongoing basis until the presales / gross debt under 0.75x (2012: 1.5x) on an ongoing basis. -Increased exposure to non-core business  Positive: Increased ratings are not expected because of the nature of property sales the cyclical, small-scale enterprises, limited business diversification compared to other developers that have a higher ranking.
