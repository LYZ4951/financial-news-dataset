April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Holland Park CLO Limited  notes expected ratings, as follows:  EUR291.875m class A-1: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR58.75m class A-2: 'AA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR30m class B: 'A+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR23.75m class C: 'BBB+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR37.5m class D: 'BB+(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable  EUR17.5m class E: 'B-(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable EUR54.25m subordinated notes: not rated   The assignment of the final ratings is contingent on the receipt of final  documents conforming to information already reviewed.  Holland Park CLO Limited is an arbitrage cash flow collateralised loan  obligation (CLO).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Portfolio Credit Quality Fitch expects the average credit quality of obligors to be in the range of  'B'/'B-'. The agency has public ratings or credit opinions on all 49 obligors in  the initial portfolio. The covenanted maximum Fitch weighted average rating  factor (WARF) for assigning today's expected ratings is 34.0. The WARF of the  initial portfolio is 31.4.   Above-average Recoveries The portfolio will comprise a minimum of 90% senior secured obligations.  Recovery prospects for these assets are typically more favourable than for  second-lien, unsecured and mezzanine assets. Fitch has assigned recovery ratings  (RR) to all obligations in the initial portfolio. The covenanted minimum  weighted average recovery rate (WARR) for assigning today's expected ratings is  68%. The WARR of the initial portfolio is 72.6%.  Payment Frequency Switch The notes pay quarterly while the portfolio assets can reset to a semi-annual  basis. The transaction has an interest-smoothing account, but no liquidity  facility. Liquidity stress for the non-deferrable class A-1 and A-2 notes,  stemming from a large proportion of assets resetting to a semi-annual basis in  any one quarterly period, is addressed by switching the payment frequency on the  notes to semi-annual in such a scenario, subject to certain conditions.  Limited Interest Rate Risk No more than 10% of the portfolio may consist of fixed-rate assets;  consequently, the majority of this risk is naturally hedged, as all notes are  floating-rate. Fitch modelled a 10% fixed-rate bucket in its analysis and the  rated notes can withstand the excess spread compression in a rising interest  rate environment.   Limited FX Risk Any non-euro-denominated assets have to be hedged with perfect asset swaps as of  the settlement date, limiting foreign exchange risk. The transaction is  permitted to invest up to 20% of the portfolio in non-euro-denominated assets.  TRANSACTION SUMMARY Net proceeds from the note issue will be used to purchase a EUR500m portfolio of  European leveraged loans and bonds. The portfolio will be managed by  Blackstone/GSO Debt Funds Management Europe Limited. The transaction will have a  four year re-investment period scheduled to end in 2018. The transaction documents may be amended subject to rating agency confirmation  or noteholder approval. Where rating agency confirmation relates to risk  factors, Fitch will analyse the proposed change and may provide a rating action  commentary if the change has a negative impact on the ratings. Such amendments  may delay the repayment of the notes as long as Fitch's analysis confirms the  expected repayment of principal at the legal final maturity.  If in the agency's opinion the amendment is risk-neutral from a rating  perspective Fitch may decline to comment. Noteholders should be aware that  confirmation is considered to be given if Fitch declines to comment.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A 25% increase in the expected obligor default probability would lead to a  downgrade of one to three notches for the rated notes. A 25% reduction in  expected recovery rates would lead to a downgrade of one to five notches for the  rated notes.  In addition, in line with its Exposure Draft - Criteria for Sovereign Risk in  Developed Markets for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds, 22 January 2014,  Fitch analysed a sensitivity of a 50% devaluation haircut to recovery rates for  assets in these jurisdictions, assuming that recovery rates may be realised in  non-euro currencies.  This sensitivity would not result in the downgrade of the class A-1 notes, the  only notes affected. This sensitivity was conducted to assess transfer and  convertibility risk if a country was to leave the currency union and it is  consistent with the proposals of the Exposure Draft.
