STOCKHOLM, April 4 (Reuters) - Sweden's centre-right government will not cut taxes if it wins a new four-year mandate in September, Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Friday.

"I don't see any room for tax cuts during the next mandate period, neither at the beginning of the period nor at the end," he told reporters at a conference held by the Moderate Party.
