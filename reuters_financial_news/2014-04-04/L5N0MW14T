MILAN, April 4 (Reuters) - Prospects of reform are making Italy's companies and banks an attractive investment target, the Italian head of BlackRock <BLK.N> said in an interview.

"Italy, its market, medium and large companies in the energy, telecommunications, credit and manufacturing sectors are extremely attractive, not just in terms of valuation but also for reasons we hope are more structural, like reforms and privatisations," Andrea Vigano told Il Sole 24 Ore on Friday. "Italy, for BlackRock, is a big investment opportunity." A new government led by left-wing Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is raising hopes of imminent reforms.  BlackRock has snapped up stakes in the country's banks. Market regulator Consob said on Thursday BlackRock had become the biggest shareholder in cooperative lender Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> adding to majority stakes picked up in the last six weeks in Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> and UniCredit <CRDI.MI>. [nL5N0MV50L] It is also the second biggest investor in Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>.  "The perception is growing, in Italy and abroad, that the banks are on the way to overcoming their problems," said Vigano, adding that measures taken by Italian lenders to recover from a deep two-year recession were also encouraging. "Writedowns worth tens of billions of euros have shown courage and seriousness," said Vigano.
