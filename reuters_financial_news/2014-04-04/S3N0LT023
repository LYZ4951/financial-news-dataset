STOCKHOLM, April 4 (Reuters) - Sweden's centre-right government, facing an election in September, wants to cut taxes further in the longer term even if there will not be room to do so in the next four years, Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Friday.

"In the long term we must carry out tax cuts," Borg told reporters. "It could be taxes on labour and on businesses." The Alliance government has cut income taxes five times and reduced corporate tax since it took power in 2006.
