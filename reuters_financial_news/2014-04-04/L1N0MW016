April 3 (Reuters) - Generic drug maker Mylan Inc <MYL.O> is looking to buy Swedish rival Meda AB <MEDAa.ST> in a deal that would create a $23 billion pharmaceutical company, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.

The exact value of the deal is unknown but Mylan is likely to pay a "significant" premium to Meda's market value, a person familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. Meda's market valuation stood at 29.5 billion Swedish krona ($4.5 billion) at the end of trading on Thursday while Mylan's market value was $18.5 billion. Pennsylvania-based Mylan has appointed advisers to help it put together a deal for Meda, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. (http://link.reuters.com/veb38v) Generic drugs continues to be a hotly contested sector with Mylan suing Celgene Corp <CELG.O> on Thursday to stop the latter's effort to keep generic versions of two drugs that generate $4.5 billion of annual sales off the market. [ID:nL1N0MV2A8] Last year, Mylan bought Agila, a unit of India's Strides Arcolab Ltd <STAR.NS>, for $1.6 billion to expand its presence in the fast-growing generic injectable drugs market. [ID:nL4N0BR94N] [ID:nL2N0HM2GD] Mylan's Nasdaq-listed shares closed down about 2 percent at $49.86 on Thursday. Officials for Mylan and Meda were not immediately available to comment on the FT report.
