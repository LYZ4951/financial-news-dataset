OSLO, April 4 (Reuters) - Norway's $860 billion oil fund should nearly double its investments in renewable energy to up to 50 billion Norwegian crowns, the finance ministry said on Friday in a major review of the fund.

The government also plans to study the risks and benefits of allowing the fund to expands its investment portfolio to unlisted companies, the ministry added.
