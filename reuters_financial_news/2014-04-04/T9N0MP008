TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - Japan's $1.26 trillion public pension fund said on Friday it has selected 14 active fund managers to supervise its domestic equities investment and added the JPX Nikkei 400 index, among others, as additional benchmarks to its investment strategy.

The Government Pension Investment Fund, known as GPIF and whose asset size exceeds the size of Mexico's economy, said it would start investing both in active and passive investments in J-REIT (Japan Real Estate Investment Trust). The move is aimed at generating higher returns to cope with pension payouts for Japan's rapidly ageing population.
