LJUBLJANA, April 4 (Reuters) - Slovenian banks could suffer losses in 2014 due to weak economic growth, central bank governor Bostjan Jazbec said on Friday.

"It is possible that Slovenian banks will end 2014 in a loss ... because it is very hard for banks to generate profit while economic growth is still very low or negative," Jazbec told reporters on the sidelines of a banking conference. Jazbec also serves on the European Central Bank's rate-setting Governing Council.
