HANOI, April 4 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged down 0.17 percent at the break on Friday in low liquidity as cautious investors anticipated more declines soon, an analyst said.

"Liquidity has been low as cautious retail investors feared that the index might extend falling," said manager Doan Minh Quan at ACB Securities. Volume on Thursday already dropped to the lowest level in nearly two months on cautious sentiment after recent losses. [ID:nL4N0MV22G] Dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> lost 0.69 percent and top insurer Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM> fell 0.92 percent on Friday. But steady buying demand from foreign investors and corporate earnings released this month may help the index rebound, Quan said. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).
