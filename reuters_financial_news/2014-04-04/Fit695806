April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based property developer PT Alam Sutera Realty Tbk's <ASRI.JK> (ASRI) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'B+' with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed ASRI's senior unsecured rating, and the ratings of its outstanding US dollar  notes (which are issued by Alam Synergy Pte Ltd, and guaranteed by ASRI) at  'B+', with a Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. A full list of rating actions is at the  end of this commentary.  The affirmation of ASRI's ratings reflects its small scale, project  concentration and the inherent cyclicality in the property development business.  The rating also recognises ASRI's strong track record of presales across its  major development properties, its low-cost land bank and good-quality  development assets.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Stability, Amid Softer Demand: ASRI expects to shift its focus towards the  middle-market segment in 2014 in order to counter weaker buyer sentiment due to  tighter regulations imposed in 2013 and Indonesia's presidential and legislative  elections that will run until July 2014. The middle-market segment consists of  more first-time home buyers - a segment that was less affected by the new  regulations in 2013. Fitch expects this strategy and the quality of its  development projects to help ASRI maintain satisfactory credit metrics through  2014. However, its presales/gross debt ratio is likely to fall towards the 0.75x  threshold (end-2013: 1.05x), below which negative rating action may be  considered. Limited but Growing Diversification: ASRI's presales grew around 50% to  IDR4.8trn in 2013. However they are considered small relative to higher-rated  developers. Fitch notes that the company's project diversification has improved,  with over 60% of its presales in 2013 stemming from outside of its main  development in Serpong (2012: 18%). Nevertheless ASRI remains less diversified  compared with higher-rated peers. Established Track Record: The ratings recognise ASRI's low-cost, large land bank  of over 2,200 hectares, strategic advantages of its main development locations,  and track record in successful project executions. ASRI is one of the pioneers  in developing large-scale townships in Serpong, which is now a popular  alternative to other areas in Greater Jakarta. Fitch expects ASRI to be able to  leverage on its success in Serpong for future project launches, as recently  demonstrated by the higher-than-expected sales for its Pasar Kemis projects. Currency Risk Mitigated: ASRI has a policy of hedging the foreign currency risk  on the principal repayment of its US dollar borrowings. The company also targets  to maintain sufficient US dollar cash reserves to cover three to four coupon  payments at any given time. Fitch believes this strategy mitigates ASRI's  currency risk but does not fully compensate for circumstances of extreme  exchange-rate volatility.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: -A sustained increase in leverage such that the presales/gross debt ratio is  below 0.75x (2012: 1.5x) on a sustained basis.  -An increase in its exposure to non-core businesses  Positive rating action is not expected due to the cyclical nature of the  property development business, the company's small scale and limited project  diversification compared with higher-rated property developers.
