IMS Health's IPO raised about $1.30 billion after the offering was priced at $20 per share, above the midpoint of its expected price range of $18-$21 per share. [ID:nL4N0MW0JM] The IPO marks the second-biggest U.S. offering so far this year, after Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc <SC.N>, the auto-finance unit of Spanish bank Santander <SAN.MC>, raised $1.8 billion in January. Of the 65 million shares offered, the Connecticut-based company sold 52 million, while the rest were sold by selling stockholders.
