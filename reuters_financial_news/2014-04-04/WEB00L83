PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - Shares in European cement makers Lafarge <LAFP.PA> and Holcim <HOLN.VX> rose on Friday after Bloomberg reported that the companies were in talks to explore a merger, citing people familiar with the matter.

Shares in France's Lafarge were 7.7 percent higher by 1408 GMT, the top gainers on the French blue-chip CAC 40 index <.FCHI>. Holcim stock was 4.5 percent higher. "It's good for the market. Things are boiling up on the M&A front, not only in the telecoms sector but also in the construction sector," said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu. He cautioned that any planned merger between Lafarge and Holcim could face anti-competition issues, but added that the European construction sector needed to consolidate. "There's overcapacity and they need to consolidate their balance sheets," he added. Shares in Germany's HeidelbergCement <HEIG.DE> also rose 5 percent following the report, the leading gainers on the DAX top-30 index <.GDAXI>.
