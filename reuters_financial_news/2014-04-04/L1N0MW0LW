NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The jobs report did pretty much what it was supposed to do - 192,000 in nonfarm payrolls, with upward revisions to the previous month, and the unemployment rate held steady. [ID:nL1N0MV1UG]

There are plenty of arguments to suggest that we shouldn't even be here after all this time, that job growth should be a bit stronger than this even. But it's one of those "we'll take it" figures and the equity market is responding well to start with, bond yields are mostly flat and the dollar hasn't budged too much either for that matter, kind of continuing the pattern of relatively solid responses to decent economic news that's not going to put anybody off. For strategists, the view of the report depends on what you think the economy should be doing at this point.  Anthony Valeri of LPL says that given the "weather disturbance, the markets wanted more than 200,000 in jobs growth. It's a Goldilocks report, not too warm and not too cold, and puts pressure on the next report."  So that's a dose of pessimism, while others suggest the payrolls figure wasn't likely to be an overly weather-affected one to begin with (which says something then about the slower months of job growth experienced at the end of the year).  Among other bright signs, the number of jobless Americans looking for work at least six months fell to 3.7 million, down about 100,000 from the month-earlier period. Flows continue to come into equity funds even though the hot money continues to rotate away from the well-known momentum names that bolstered broader markets for the balance of 2013 and early 2014 - the S&P ended a tick lower Thursday while the Nasdaq fell nearly 1 percent.
