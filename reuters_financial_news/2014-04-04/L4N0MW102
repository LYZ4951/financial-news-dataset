HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd <0388.HK> repeated that it is in talks to cooperate with mainland China stock exchanges, after its shares rose 3.5 percent in Hong Kong on Friday following further media coverage of the matter.

"We confirm that our position as disclosed in our last announcement dated 2 April 2014 remains unchanged," HKEx said in a statement. HKEx shares jumped nearly 6 percent on Wednesday, their biggest gain in over a year, after the 21st Century Business Herald reported the talks are nearing conclusion. HKEx confirmed the talks but said there is no guarantee any deal could be reached.
