FRANKFURT, April 4 (Reuters) - Private equity investor Lone Star [LS.UL] is expected to receive bids from some large European banks for its German corporate bank IKB <IKBG.F>, one of Germany's high-profile victims of the financial crisis, two people familiar with the transaction said.

Banks such as HSBC <HSBA.L>, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, Santander <SAN.MC>, Rabobank and SEB <SEBa.ST> received information packages on IKB in early March and have been asked to return with non-binding offers by a mid-April deadline, the people said.  Some of these banks, which all aim to expand their business with medium-sized German companies - IKB's specialty - are only interested in the corporate lending activities and not the whole bank, they added.
