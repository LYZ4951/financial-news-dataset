April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Virgin Media Inc.'s (Virgin Media) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is below. Virgin Media's key strength is its "second-incumbent" qualities in the UK and  its strong market share within its geographic footprint. Competition in the UK  triple-play services market has increased with BT Group's <BT.L> push into pay-TV, but  Virgin Media has produced a steady financial performance with healthy cash flow  generation despite limited subscriber growth. Fitch expects Liberty Global,  Virgin Media's parent company, to continue to run Virgin Media's leverage near  the higher end of 5.0x net debt/EBITDA ratio, as it does with its other European  cable subsidiaries.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Market Position A maturing market and a fairly even split in market share, coupled with a drive  towards ever faster broadband and increased bundling has resulted in Virgin  Media being able to increase subscription fees without dropping subscribers  (approximately 0.4% growth in 2013). The continued rationalisation in the UK  broadband market together with Virgin Media's unique high quality network  positions Virgin Media as a quasi-incumbent within its geographic footprint with  a high quality broadband service and a strong overall bundled product offering.  Infrastructure vs. Content Sky leads the pay-TV market in the UK with 10.4m customers vs. Virgin Media's  3.8m. However, Virgin Media positions itself as a distributor rather than a  content owner. This reflects Virgin Media's key competitive advantage of high  speed broadband provision, rather than competing for content. Whereas BT have  moved into content (notably through the purchase of live football broadcasting  rights), Virgin Media positions itself as a distributor, making Sky a strategic  partner in the provision of content as well as a strong rival.  Emergence of Quad Play Although the UK is a highly competitive market, it is more stable relative to  other European countries. This is driven by high residential broadband  penetration (c75% of households), consolidating market structure (four players  hold near 90% of total subscribers), increased bundling (Virgin Media sells 2.5  products per customer) and reduced churn. Virgin Media have increased the  "stickiness" of their offering with mobile services via a mobile virtual network  operator (MVNO) agreement with EE, formerly called Everything Everywhere.  However, BT also recently announced an MVNO agreement with EE and Fitch expects  BT to enhance their consumer service offering with a mobile component. This is  likely to have implications for Sky and TalkTalk as well as for mobile operators  such as Vodafone and O2, who may respond with their improved bundled offerings.  Increased "Bundling" Competition Having increased subscription fees in 2013 while suffering limited subscriber  losses, Virgin Media appears to be operating in a stable market. However,  increasing bundling competition (such as BT and Virgin Media partnering with EE)  amongst the main four fixed line operators means that each player will have to  guard their market position as well as focusing on the monetisation of their  existing customer bases.  Capital Structure Constraints Liberty Global's financial strategy requires their operating subsidiaries to  take on significant levels of debt. While Virgin Media's strong and stable cash  flows may make this strategy highly effective, it constrains the rating due to  high leverage. Fitch calculates year-end 2013 funds from operations (FFO)  adjusted net leverage at 4.9x, which is in line with a sub-investment grade  profile.   High Recovery for Senior Creditors Despite gross senior secured financial debt of GBP6.8bn (FY2013), recovery  prospects for senior secured bond holders are high. This is underpinned by the  extensive cable network (12.5m homes passed, 4.9m customers) and the long-term  capability of Virgin Media's network to provide high speed internet. The senior  secured debt has a rating of 'BB+'/'RR'1, three notches higher than the IDR.  However, Fitch expects limited recovery for junior creditors; unsecured debt is  currently rated 'B-'/'RR6'.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: - Negative rating action could occur if the company's FFO adjusted net leverage  increases above 5.5x, FFO fixed charge cover falls below 2.5x or if pre-dividend  free cash flow margin falls below 5% on a sustainable basis  - A material decline in operational performance, regulatory change or other  significant negative impact to the current dynamics of the pay-TV, telephony and  broadband business in the UK would be ratings negative.   Positive: - A firm commitment by Virgin Media to adopt a more conservative financial  policy (for example, FFO adjusted net leverage of 4.5x) could lead to positive  rating action.  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE Virgin Media has an undrawn GBP660m revolving credit facility. Excluding the  convertible bond, the company's next bond maturity is January 2018. Total cash  at year-end 2013 was GBP343m.
