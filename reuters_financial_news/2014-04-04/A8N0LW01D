ATHENS, April 4 (Reuters) - Greek lender Eurobank <EURBr.AT> announced on Friday, as expected, it planned to sell up to 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) worth of new shares to plug a capital hole.

Eurobank, which is almost fully-owned by Greek bank bailout fund HFSF, has a capital shortfall of 2.95 billion euros, according to the results of a stress test of Greek lenders unveiled last month by the country's central bank.
