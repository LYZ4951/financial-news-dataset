SYDNEY, April 4 (Reuters) - Australian aged care services provider Japara Healthcare plans to raise up to A$450.4 million ($415.79 million) in what would be the country's biggest initial public offering (IPO) of the year so far.

Lead manager Macquarie Group Ltd <MQG.AX> filed a prospectus for Japara's IPO with the Australian Securities Exchange late on Friday, just a short time after three mid-sized companies aborted IPOs. [ID:nL4N0MO4MD]
