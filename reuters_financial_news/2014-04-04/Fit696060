April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Improved investor sentiment towards Italian banks and the search for yield are positive at a time when many Italian lenders are taking actions to strengthen capital, Fitch Ratings says. This may open up the Basel III-compliant capital securities market for some Italian banks, to help them meet the markets' requirement for higher loss-absorbing capital and combat  capital shortfalls that might arise from the ECB's comprehensive assessment this  year. Last week UniCredit was the first Italian bank to issue additional Tier 1 (AT1)  capital notes. We rate the USD1.25bn notes at 'BB-', five notches off the bank's  'bbb+' Viability Rating (VR). The notching reflects the notes' higher expected  loss severity relative to senior unsecured creditors (two notches) and higher  non-performance risk (three notches), in line with similar bank securities in  other European countries.  The AT1 instruments will boost UniCredit's <CRDI.MI> capitalisation. We assign 50% equity  credit to the notes for our capital analysis. In contrast, we do not assign any  equity credit to most of the existing legacy Tier 1 capital securities issued by  Italian banks.  We believe other banks in Italy, most likely the larger national champions, will  tap the AT1 market in the medium term, following UniCredit's lead. Italian  lenders have been later than other banks in large European countries in issuing  Basel III-compliant securities. However, investor confidence has improved for  southern European banks in general, and UniCredit's deal comes after AT1 issues  by Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria <BBVA.MC> (the latter issuance is also  rated five notches off the bank's VR).  International investor interest appears to have returned for Italian banks more  broadly. Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>, a bank undergoing significant restructuring,  returned to the senior unsecured market last week for the first time since July  2012, with a EUR1bn five-year senior unsecured issue (rated 'BBB'). Order books  for recent bond issues have been oversubscribed, spreads have generally  tightened this year and the FTSE Italia All-Share Banks index has risen 33% in  the year to date. This confidence could help Italian banks rebalance funding  profiles and strengthen capital.
