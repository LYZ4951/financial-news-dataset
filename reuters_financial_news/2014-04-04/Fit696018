April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The improved operating performance by Spain's autonomous communities in 2013 is broadly in line with central government requirements, meaning that the central government will remain willing to provide timely liquidity support if needed, Fitch Ratings says. This willingness is  reflected in the 'BBB-' ratings floor for Spanish autonomous communities, which  we introduced last year.  Preliminary accounts for 2013, released by the Ministry of Finance and Public  Administration, include a variety of fiscal data showing that the aggregate  fiscal deficit narrowed to 1.26% of GDP. This is down from 2.23% a year earlier.  The data set is complex and the accounts will not be finalised until later this  year and may be adjusted, and several regions appear to have missed the  individual deficit targets that central government set for the first time last  July.  Nevertheless, these regions are also pursuing fiscal consolidation, and overall  fiscal results have continued to improve. Even where individual fiscal targets  have been missed, this does not affect the ratings floor, as we think that  central government will recognise efforts to narrow deficits and reduce spending  in 2013, in the face of almost flat operating revenues.  Falls in both capital and operating expenditure have reduced deficits. Staff  costs in particular have fallen in recent years. However, a conversion of  commercial liabilities into financial debt meant that 2012 accounts included  spending from previous years that had not necessarily been reported. This helps  account for the sharp (7.3%) drop in operating expenditure in 2013 versus the  previous years.   Overall operating performance improved but remains weak, with an aggregate  negative current balance. Only a small share at best of debt servicing  (principal and interest payments), which represents 18% of the autonomous  communities' aggregate 2014 budget, will be met from the operating balance, with  greater reliance on additional debt issuance. This will add to pressure to cut  operating expenditure further, which may be difficult given the extent of the  cuts already made.  Nevertheless, we think that operating performance can continue to improve, and  that central government will be satisfied with the decrease in operating and  capital expenditures seen in 2013. The EUR23bn Regional Liquidity Fund (FLA) is  available in 2014 to help the autonomous communities meet refinancing needs at  reasonable cost if other funding sources are not available.  We also view the two-year old Budgetary Stability Law (BSL) as an important  mechanism to help Spanish regions meet central government's fiscal targets. The  FLA and BSL were both important factors in introducing our ratings floor.
