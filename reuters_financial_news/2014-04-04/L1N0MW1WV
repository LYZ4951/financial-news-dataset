April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. broker-dealer LPL Financial LLC on Friday said a senior executive has resigned, effective immediately, amid concerns regarding his interactions with other employees.

The executive, Derek Bruton, was managing director of independent adviser services at the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of LPL Financial Holdings Inc <LPLA.O>. [ID:nEOLcgzgvk] LPL Financial told Reuters the move was not related to the company's performance. The firm said it intends to fill Bruton's position from a slate of internal leaders, expectedly by the end of next week.  Bruton, who played basketball for Stanford University between 1986-90, joined LPL Financial in 2007 from TD Ameritrade Holding Corp <AMTD.N>.
