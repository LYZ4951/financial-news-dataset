ISTANBUL, April 4 (Reuters) - Turkish conglomerate Sabanci Holding expects 15 percent sales growth and a double-digit rise in return on equity in 2014, Chief Executive Zafer Kurtul said on Friday.

Sabanci Holding <SAHOL.IS>, which controls many publicly traded companies including Akbank <AKBNK.IS>, Cimsa <CIMSA.IS> and Akcansa <AKCNS.IS> - will make investments worth between 3.8 billion lira ($1.8 billion) and 4 billion this year, in line with last year's 3.8 billion, Kurtul told reporters. Kurtul also said Sabanci wasn't happy with the price of its shares trading on the Istanbul stock exchange, but didn't have plans for a buyback.
