FRANKFURT, April 4 (Reuters) - Banks will return 4.879 billion euros ($6.69 billion) in crisis loans to the European Central Bank next week, more than expected, but still less than the double-digit returns last month, as the extra cash in the system reaches critical levels.

The amount banks will repay on April 9 is more than this week's repayments of 1.558 billion euros and is above the 2 billion forecast in a Reuters poll. [ECB/REFI] In March, banks repaid in total more than 40 billion euros, driven in part by the expiry of some of the sovereign bonds that they had bought with the cheap money. Lenders have also been shaping up their balance sheets for the review the ECB is making of their assets before it takes over banking supervision. The pace with which banks are repaying loans they took from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012 to ride out a period of tight funding has slowed since, as the level of liquidity in the system beyond what banks need for their day-to-day operations dropped to critical levels. Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> has fallen close to 100 billion euros from around 800 billion euros at its peak in early 2012. The usual market tightness towards the end of the quarter exacerbated the situation last week.   Overnight bank-to-bank borrowing costs are expected to move up once excess liquidity drops below a certain level, seen between 80 billion and 100 billion euros.  This development would make it more expensive for banks to get overnight funding and more attractive for them to hold on to the cheap long-term ECB loans. On Friday, the ECB said five banks would repay 2.527 billion euros from the first LTRO on April 9, and seven banks would pay back 2.352 billion from the second LTRO.
