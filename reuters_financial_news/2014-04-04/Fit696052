April 4 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed China's Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+'. The issue ratings on China's senior unsecured foreign and local currency bonds are also affirmed at 'A+'. The Outlooks on the Long-Term IDRs are Stable. The Country Ceiling is affirmed at 'A+' and the Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F1'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  The affirmation of China's IDRs reflects the following key rating drivers: - The sovereign external balance sheet is China's core sovereign credit  strength. China's foreign reserves rose to USD3,821bn at end-2013. This was  equal to 19.2 months of current external payments, the third-highest ratio of  any Fitch-rated sovereign globally. China's official reserves dwarf public  external debt of USD34bn. Sovereign net foreign assets were worth 44.1% of GDP  at end-2013, the second-highest ratio among sovereigns rated in the 'A' range  (those rated 'A-', 'A' and 'A+'). - China's growth model faces tightening constraints from the rapidly increasing  burden of leverage in the economy and from the deteriorating ability of the  economy to absorb additional investment profitably. Continued growth of  investment faster than overall GDP could see further erosion of China's current  account surplus as the capacity of domestic savings to finance investment  becomes more constrained. Rebalancing has yet to begin in earnest. The  contribution of investment to overall GDP growth at 4.2pp outpaced consumption's  contribution of 3.9pp in 2013. The structural economic challenge of rebalancing  away from investment-led and credit-fuelled growth weighs on the credit profile. - However, the state-led nature of China's economy endows the authorities with  powerful levers for short-term demand management, which supports confidence in  prospects for a smooth adjustment. GDP growth decelerated to 7.7% in 2012 and  2013, below China's five-year average of 8.9%, although comfortably above the  global emerging-market median for 2013 of 4%. Available data indicate the labour  market has remained robust to this slowdown. China's GDP growth would remain  less volatile out to 2015 than the 'A' range median in Fitch's projections.  However, the rebalancing process entails some risk of sharply higher volatility  if things go less smoothly than Fitch expects.  - China's leadership has set out an ambitious reform agenda in a series of key  policy meetings starting with the Third Plenum in November 2013. The Third  Plenum established a central leadership team on reform headed by President Xi  Jinping. Tangible progress remains limited, although the shift in policy  direction is relatively recent. Evidence of strong political commitment to  reform supports the ratings.  - Fitch estimates the level of aggregate financing in China's economy at 217% of  GDP at end-2013, up from 198% at end-2012 and 128% at end-2008. The Chinese  authorities have acted more aggressively to contain risks to financial stability  since mid-2013. These steps included allowing greater volatility in domestic  market interest rates and, more recently, in the Chinese yuan's exchange rate to  discourage "one-way bets", and allowing some explicit defaults in the wholesale  capital markets. The People's Bank of China has indicated a two-year timeframe  for full deposit rate liberalisation. In Fitch view, this could be a powerful  engine for economic rebalancing by supporting household incomes and encouraging  more rational lending and investment. - Fitch estimates general government debt rose to 53% of GDP at end-2013, not  far off the 'A' range median of 52%. This includes about 12% of GDP classified  as contingent liabilities by the National Audit Office. The state-dominated  nature of China's economy means "true" contingent liabilities may be  considerably higher. Fitch expects the resolution of China's debt problem will  ultimately see debt migration onto the sovereign balance sheet in one form or  another. However, greater official willingness to tolerate defaults may  eventually contain the sovereign's exposure. - Fundamental credit weaknesses, including low average incomes and weak scores  for governance, weigh on the credit profile relative to 'A' range peers. Lack of  transparency over the finances of local governments impedes analysis of the  sovereign's overall finances and is a weakness relative to 'A' peers.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that upside and downside risks to the  rating are balanced. The main factors that individually or collectively could  lead to rating action are as follows: Positive: - The country's ability to navigate structural economic adjustment without  economic, financial or social disruption is centrally important for the  sovereign credit profile and ratings. Progress on reform and rebalancing without  disruptive shocks would reduce China's structural vulnerabilities. - Greater confidence over the scale of the debt problem in China's broader  economy, and of the approach to resolving it. Negative: - Continuation of "more of the same" credit-fuelled and investment-led growth,  reflecting an absence of material progress on reform and rebalancing, would  exacerbate China's structural vulnerabilities. The ultimate resolution would  likely be riskier and potentially costlier for the sovereign. - A further significant and sustained rise in public indebtedness, potentially  reflecting a crystallisation of contingent liabilities, without a clear prospect  of a subsequent sustained decline.   KEY ASSUMPTIONS The ratings assume a backdrop of continued gradual recovery of the global  economy without a systemic crisis in global emerging markets, including China's  regional neighbours, as the Fed "tapers" monetary easing. Recognising China's emergence onto the global stage, the ratings assume the  continuation of an open global trade and financial system.
