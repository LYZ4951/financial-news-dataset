BANGKOK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Indonesia's key index hit a three-month closing low on Friday, suffering the worst weekly loss since March amid political concerns while most other Southeast Asian stock markets eked out gains ahead of a key U.S. jobs report. <ECONUS>

Foreign investors sold financials and large caps such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> and Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK>, bringing Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> 1 percent lower at 4,949.35, the lowest close since July 4. News that Indonesia's opposition coalition had won the position of the speaker of the legislature raised concerns that President-elect Joko Widodo may not be able to muster enough support in parliament to push through badly-needed reforms. [ID:nL3N0RY0WN] The benchmark posted a weekly loss of 3.6 percent, the biggest since the week ended March 21 and the worst performer in the region. Most others fell on the week, with Thai stocks <.SETI> sliding 1.9 percent after two straight weeks of gains, Singapore <.FTSTI> ending down 1.2 percent on the week, its third, and the Philippines <.PSI> extended loss for a second week, down 0.2 percent.
