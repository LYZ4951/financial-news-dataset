MILAN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - A consortium comprising U.S. asset manager Fortress <FIG.N> and Italian property group Prelios <PCRE.MI> is currently in pole position to buy the bad-loan manager UniCredit <CRDI.MI> has put up for sale, three sources close to the matter said on Friday.

The sale, which could yield Italy's biggest bank by assets around 700 million euros ($875 million), is part of UniCredit's plan to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of the outcome of a Europe-wide bank asset review. Fortress and Prelios are pitted against a group of investors led by U.S. private equity fund Lone Star after UniCredit drew a shortlist of potential bidders last month. The bank is now expected to make a final decision in the coming weeks. "Prelios and Fortress are favoured because such a tie-up has a bigger potential for industrial synergies," one of the sources said. "Clearly, things could change if Lone Star came up with a very generous offer."  A deadline to submit binding offers expires on Sunday. UniCredit and Prelios declined to comment. Fortress and Lone Star were not immediately available for a comment. The unit for sale, UniCredit Credit Management Bank (UCCMB), manages more than 40 billion euros of non-performing loans that belong to both UniCredit and to third parties. The winner would buy both UCCMB's business operations, or "platform", and a bad loan portfolio worth around 3.4 billion euros.
