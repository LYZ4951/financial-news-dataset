MILAN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Italian real estate group Risanamento <RN.MI> said on Friday it was not aware of any plans to liquidate the group and delist its shares, contrary to a report in the Italian press.

The cash-strapped company, which in January sold prized French assets to repay part of its debts, said it would meet banks involved in its debt restructuring plan in coming days.
