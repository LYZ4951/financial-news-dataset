SAO PAULO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Activity in Brazil's services sector rebounded in September from a drop the month before, as campaign spending ahead of an October election contributed to a gradual recovery in Latin America's largest economy.

HSBC's Purchasing Managers Index for Brazilian Services <BRPMIS=ECI> rose on a seasonally adjusted basis to 51.2 in September from 49.2 in August. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction. The rise offset an ongoing slump in manufacturing activity. As a result HSBC's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> for the country edged up to 50.6 in September from 49.6 in August. Brazil's economy has struggled to pull out of its recession in the first half of the year, as investment dropped sharply and business confidence plunged. Services companies have escaped the brunt of the downturn in recent years as low unemployment fueled consumption, but the PMI survey in August showed the sharpest slowdown in services in two years. [ID:nN9N0ON02P] Service providers reported costs rising at a more modest pace in September, suggesting the recent slowdown has eased inflationary pressures.
