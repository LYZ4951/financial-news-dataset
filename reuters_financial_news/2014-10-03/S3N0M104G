STOCKHOLM, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The economy has developed roughly as expected since the Riksbank held its last monetary policy meeting, Swedish central bank Governor Stefan Ingves said on Friday.

"So far, and it is only a month ago, it (the situation) is roughly as we had expected," Ingves told reporters.
