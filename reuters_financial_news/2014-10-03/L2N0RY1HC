Oct 3 (Reuters) - Trump Taj Mahal failed on Friday to get approval from a U.S. Bankruptcy judge to end payments to the casino's union pension fund, which had been a key condition for a Carl Icahn-backed deal to rescue the gambling complex in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross in Wilmington, Delaware, said he lacked authority to allow Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc <TRMYQ.PK>, the bankrupt owner of the Taj Mahal, to reject a portion of its collective bargaining agreement, or CBA.
