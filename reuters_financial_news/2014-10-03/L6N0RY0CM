BUDAPEST, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Hungary's ruling party could make a decision about the planned conversion of household foreign currency loans into forints at its meeting on Nov. 4, a senior Fidesz lawmaker said on Friday.

Antal Rogan, head of the party's parliamentary group, said a new bill on consumer loans would also be discussed. "The decision could be made (in 2014), while how and when the conversion will be actually carried out - with this, it's worthwhile to wait until the banks settle refunds on past loans with borrowers," Rogan told public radio.  As a result of banks' refunds to be paid to borrowers, the outstanding principal on foreign currency loans will decrease.
