HONG KONG, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang warned on Friday afternoon that sustained protests in the city's financial centre could create "permanent" damage to the Asian financial hub.

The city's financial and money markets have been functioning normally, but he said the stock market could expect to experience short-term volatility and that investors should be aware of the risks.
