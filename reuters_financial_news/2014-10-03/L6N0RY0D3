MOSCOW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Russia's rouble <RUB=> weakened to 44.40 against a dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX> soon after opening on Friday, hitting the level where the central bank starts unlimited interventions to defend the currency.

The rouble first breached this level on Oct. 1, prompting the central bank's first interventions to support the rouble since May.
