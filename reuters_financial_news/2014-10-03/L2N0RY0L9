NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Shares of Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd <SLXP.O> were higher in premarket trading on Friday, up 3.2 percent to $156 in heavy volume.

The move came after the company said it had terminated a merger agreement with Swiss-listed Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA <COPN.S>, citing a "changed political environment" related to "inversions," where a company reincorporates abroad in order to escape U.S. taxes.
