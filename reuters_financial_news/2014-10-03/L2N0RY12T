NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday signaled that former Jefferies Group Inc managing director Jesse Litvak has a good chance to overturn his conviction for defrauding investors in a government program established after the 2008 financial crisis.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday granted Litvak's bid to stay out of prison while he appeals his March 7 conviction, which resulted in a two-year prison term. In a brief order, the appeals court said Litvak has raised "a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal."
