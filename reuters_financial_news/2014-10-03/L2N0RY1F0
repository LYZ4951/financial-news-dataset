NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Shares of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc <CLF.N> tumbled on Friday, extending the stock's recent weakness after Nomura downgraded it to "reduce" from "buy."

The firm also slashed its price target on the stock, dropping it from $18 to $5 to reflect "sharply reduced net asset value" following a decline in iron ore prices.  The price decline "has significant negative implications for medium-term earnings and should severely limit strategic options with regards to potential asset sales." Nomura forecast that the company would report a loss in fiscal 2014. Cliffs lost 14 percent to $8.59 as the biggest percentage decliner on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the biggest one-day drop for the stock since February 2013, and its volume of 14.7 million shares was well above its 50-day average of 7.7 million. The stock has been pressured throughout 2014, losing more than two-thirds of its value. It is on track for its 11th decline of the past 13 sessions.
