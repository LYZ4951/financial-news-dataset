LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Troubled British grocer Tesco <TSCO.L> "has no current plans" for a rights issue, a spokesman for the firm said on Friday.

He was responding to media speculation that Tesco could raise around 3 billion pounds ($4.82 billion) through a share issue to prop up its balance sheet.
