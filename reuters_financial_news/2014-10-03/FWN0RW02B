LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - British bank Aldermore said on Friday it plans to list on the stock market later this month, setting a price range that implies a market capitalisation of about 800 million pounds  ($1.29 billion)

Aldermore, partly owned by private equity fund AnaCap Financial Partners, focuses on lending to small and medium sized businesses and homeowners. The bank said in a statement that a price range has been set at between 217 and 265 pence per share. Final pricing is expected to be announced on or around Oct. 17, the bank said in a statement. Earlier this week peer bank Virgin Money said it intends to raise 150 million pounds from a stock market listing.
