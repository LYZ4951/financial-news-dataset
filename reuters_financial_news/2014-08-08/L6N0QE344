COPENHAGEN, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The pressure on the Danish crown <EURDKK=D3> to depreciate against the euro has abated after a tense spring during which the currency hit its weakest level against the eurozone currency in more than eight years, a new index showed on Friday.

"EUR/DKK has spent the summer hovering around 7.4560-70, which should be the sweet spot for the Nationalbank," analyst Jens Pedersen from Danske Bank wrote in a note to clients. Denmark's biggest financial institution, Danske Bank <DANSKE.CO>, has assembled a new index that it says will allow investors to monitor pressure on the Danish crown and ultimately guess when the central bank changes its key interest rates. The DKK Exchange Market Pressure Index (EMPI) is calculated by moves in the Danish crown in relation to the crown's central parity rate to the euro, the central bank's intervention and the money market's interest rate spread versus the euro area. European Union member Denmark's policy of holding the crown steady against the euro forces the central bank to shift interest rates for the sole purpose of keeping the currency around its central parity rate of 7.46038. During the last 15 years the crown has traded in a narrow band between 7.42 and 7.48 against the euro, and at 1223 GMT on Friday it traded at 7.4549. The current pricing in the foreign exchange forward market may reflect expectations that the central bank over the coming year will refrain from matching the unconventional easing measures implemented by the ECB, Danske Bank said. "The market may thus be speculating that Nationalbanken consequently will allow a strong crown relative to the central rate," Pedersen wrote. Historically, the Danish central bank has preferred to keep the crown slightly on the strong side of the central rate.
