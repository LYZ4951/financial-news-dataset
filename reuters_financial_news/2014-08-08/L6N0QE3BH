TIRANA, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Albania's consumer prices rose 1.8 percent in July over the same period last year mainly due to a hike in prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks, the Institute of Statistics said on Friday.

On a monthly basis, prices in July dropped by 0.6 percent over June, the fourth consecutive month of deflation, the Institute added.   Albanian CPI July 2014   June 2014   July 2013  Month-on-month   -0.6-0.7-0.8   Year-on-year1.8 1.5 1.6
