HONG KONG, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark share index had its first losing week in four, despite strength in Chinese energy companies on Friday due to higher oil prices.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> fell 0.2 percent on Friday to 24,331.41 points. It slipped 0.8 percent this week.  The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was down 0.4 percent on the day and 1.4 percent on the week.  China's three largest state oil companies - PetroChina <0857.HK>, China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation <0386.HK> and CNOOC <0883.HK> - climbed 1.2, 1.2 and 1.7 percent, respectively.
