SHANGHAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Chinese money rates dropped this week as liquidity conditions improved after the seasonal demand at the end of month last week, helping offset a net drain from the central bank via open market operations.

The  weighted average of the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase agreement <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 3.47 percent by midday on Friday, down 43 basis points from last week's close. The overnight repo rate <CN1DRP=CFXS> was at 2.98 percent, down 22 basis points, while the 14-day repo <CN14DRP=CFXS>, slumped 61 basis points this week to 3.65 percent. Chinese money markets typically see their rates rising late in a month when banks need to mobilise additional funds to meet regulatory requirements such as the loan-to-deposit ratio. Rates also typically fall early in a new month. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) drained a net 20 billion yuan ($3.25 billion) from money markets this week, the second straight week that it mopped up cash. [CN/MMT] "The central bank's slight drain of funds is a signal that it wants to keep money supply stable," said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai. "The market reaction was muted because money is not in short supply." As Chinese economy shows signs of recovery of late, traders said they expected the PBOC might be less generous in offering cash to the money market for the rest of this year as compared with the first half. As a result, traders said they expected money market rates  would be unlikely to drop sharply. "The seven-day repo rate may move between 3.2 and 3.3 percent next week," the trader said. China's surprisingly buoyant exports in July pushed its trade surplus to a record, although a drop in imports signals sluggish domestic demand that will likely call for continuing policy support to keep economic growth on track.[ID:nL4N0QD333] Exports in July jumped 14.5 percent from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs said on Friday, doubling from 7.2 percent in June and roundly beating market expectations. The PBOC increased the supply of liquidity to the money market in the first half of this year as economic growth slowed and the government sought measures to underpin growth.
