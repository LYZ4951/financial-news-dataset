LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - British housebuilder Bellway <BWY.L> said its forward order book had risen by 36 percent to a record 924.3 million pounds ($1.55 billion), helped by strong customer demand supported by an improving economic outlook and positive mortgage market conditions.

The company also said in a trading update it sold 21 percent more homes in the year to end-July, up to 6,851 homes, at an average selling price of about 213,000 pounds, up from 193,025 pounds a year ago. Chief Executive Ted Ayres said Bellway had increased output to satisfy demand driven by the strength of the UK housing market.
