MILAN, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's fifth biggest bank UBI Banca <UBI.MI> were suspended for excessive gains on Friday after the lender posted a higher-than expected net profit in the second quarter.

UBI's profit came in at 48.1 million euros, above a forecast of 33 million euros in an analyst consensus distributed by the bank.
