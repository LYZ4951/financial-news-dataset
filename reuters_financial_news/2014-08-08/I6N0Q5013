MILAN, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> fell nearly 10 percent on Friday, hit by a flood of sell orders triggered by a bigger-than-expected second quarter net loss on the back of charges for souring loans.

Other Italian bank shares continued to show weakness for a second day in a row on Friday, hit by concerns that Italy's deteriorating economic outlook could hit the quality of domestic banks' assets, forcing the lenders to hike loan loss provisions. Shares in Monte Paschi were down nearly 10 percent at 0733 GMT.
