PARIS, Aug 8 (Reuters) - European shares dropped on Friday, sinking for the seventh time in eight sessions on mounting geopolitical jitters after U.S. President Barack Obama authorized air strikes in Iraq.

At 0708 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.9 percent at 1,302.48 points. The benchmark index has lost about 7 percent since mid-June. Obama said on Thursday he had authorized U.S. air strikes to blunt the onslaught of Islamist militants in northern Iraq and began airdrops of supplies to besieged religious minorities to prevent a "potential act of genocide."
