BRUSSELS, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Nationalised Franco-Belgian financial group Dexia <DEXI.BR> reported a smaller net loss for the first half of 2014 compared with the same period last year, as it benefited from lower funding and risk costs.

The bank, 94 percent owned by the Belgian and French states, said its net loss in the first half was 178 million euros ($237.83 million) before one-off items, 127 million euros less than in the same period last year.
