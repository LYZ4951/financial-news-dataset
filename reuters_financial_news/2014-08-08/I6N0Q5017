MILAN, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Italian market watchdog Consob temporarily banned short-selling in the shares of bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> and luxury shoemaker Tod's <TOD.MI> after both stocks fell sharply following disappointing results.

Consob said in a statement the ban would come into force with immediate effect and last until the end of the trading session on Monday.   Both Monte Paschi and Tod's reported first-half results on Thursday after market closed.
