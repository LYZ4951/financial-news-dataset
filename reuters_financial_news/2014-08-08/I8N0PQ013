MUMBAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - India's NSE index fell more than 1 percent on Friday, marking its second consecutive weekly decline, as blue-chips such as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> slumped on global risk aversion after U.S. President Barack Obama authorised targeted air strikes in Iraq.

The broader NSE index <.NSEI> provisionally lost 1.05 percent, its third straight session of falls, while also closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 21.
