SAO PAULO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's largest homebuilders are likely to post uninspiring second-quarter results as they struggle with a weaker domestic economy and persistent sales cancellations, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts released on Friday.

Positive cash generation could provide a silver lining, however, the poll showed. Second-quarter sales and launches were interrupted by the monthlong soccer World Cup, which began in June. Some builders have postponed new project starts until the third quarter. Analysts said a weak domestic economy might continue to challenge the industry this year. Cancellations have dogged builders in recent quarters, along with the delivery of a batch of less-profitable housing units that suffered from higher construction costs.  "While we acknowledge that earnings will likely still be compressed as a result of lower top lines and weaker margins from older launch vintages, we believe that some companies will continue to deliver positive free cash flow," Itau BBA analysts Enrico Trotta and Ariel Amar wrote in a client note.  Investors have focused on builders' efforts to boost sales and generate more cash this year to reduce debt and pay more dividends to shareholders.  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA <CYRE3.SA>, Brazil's No. 1 homebuilder by market value, probably earned 172.2 million reais ($75.2 million) in the quarter, according to the average estimate of seven analysts. That would be down 5.9 percent from a year earlier. Analysts expect Cyrela to report positive free cash flow in the quarter despite outlays for land purchases, although earnings will be dampened by penalties for canceled land transactions and delayed units. At MRV Engenharia SA <MRVE3.SA>, which concentrates on the low-income segment, net income should fall 30 percent to 98.7 million reais. Most analysts expect free cash flow to rise and gross profit margin to improve slightly, despite still-high cancellations. Middle-market homebuilder Gafisa SA <GFSA3.SA> is expected to post a 20.8 million reais profit, compared with a year-earlier loss of 14.1 million reais. "We believe that the health of Gafisa's sales depends much more on consumer confidence, while that of (its low-income Tenda unit) depends on employment levels," wrote Bradesco BBI analyst Luis Mauricio Garcia. "The overall picture looks bad for both." Even Construtora e Incorporadora SA <EVEN3.SA>, the largest builder in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, is expected to earn 55.7 million reais, down 28.5 percent from a year earlier.  A sharp decline in sales as well as outlays for land should keep free cash flow at neutral levels, most analysts said. Gafisa plans to report quarterly earnings after markets close on Friday. Even reports on Tuesday, Cyrela on Wednesday and MRV on Thursday.
