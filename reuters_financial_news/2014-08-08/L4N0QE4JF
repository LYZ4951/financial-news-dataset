MUMBAI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell 1 percent on Friday, to mark their third consecutive session of declines, as blue-chips such as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> slumped on global risk aversion after U.S. President Barack Obama authorised targeted air strikes in Iraq.

Global shares tumbled on Friday on rising worries of another drawn-out conflict in the region. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> also closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Feb. 21, sparking worries of a further sell-off. Also, a hawkish stance by the cental bank in its monetary policy review on Tuesday coupled with sustained selling by overseas investors who are largely responsible for the indexes touching record highs in the previous month, also weighed Foreign investors sold shares worth $11.92 million on Thursday, provision exchange data shows, totalling sales of $321 million in July so far.  The falls on Friday sent the NSE index <.NSEI> down 0.44 percent, for a second consecutive weekly fall.  "People will continue to book profits on reasons like global uncertainty, and valuations, but there wont be a sell-off," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> lost 1.02 percent, or 259.87 points, to end at 25,329.14, also falling 0.6 percent to mark its second straight weekly fall.  The broader NSE index fell 1.06 percent, or 80.70 points, to end at 7,568.55.Blue-chips were among the leading decliners.  Larsen & Toubro lost 2.6 percent while HDFC Bank <HDBK.NS> fell 1.9 percent.

Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> fell 0.9 percent and Oil and Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS> ended 1.5 percent lower. Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> fell 2.1 percent ahead of its April-June earnings on Monday. Hindalco Industries <HALC.NS> fell 2.7 percent after its unit Novelis Inc's <NVLX.UL> April-June operating profit lagged some estimates, analysts say.
