KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) <MASM.KL> said on Friday that state investor Khazanah Nasional will offer 27 sen for each share in the company it does not own, amounting to nearly 1.4 billion ringgit ($435 million) to take the troubled airline private.

Khazanah, which owns 69.37 percent of MAS, will undertake a comprehensive review and restructuring of the airline, which has suffered two jetliner disasters this year, MAS said in a statement after announcing the suspension of its shares. The move to de-list MAS from the Malaysian stock exchange is due to the airline's unfavourable financial performance, having recorded a net loss for the past three years, it said.
