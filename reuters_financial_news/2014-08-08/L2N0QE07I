LIMA, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Peru's biggest financial holding company, Credicorp <BAP.N> <BAP.LM>, reported 584.7 million soles ($207.86 million) in second-quarter net profit on Thursday, in line with market expectations.

The average estimate of seven analysts was $210.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The second-quarter result represented a 300 percent increase from net profit in the same period in 2013, but a 12 percent decline from the first quarter. The company said the quarter-on-quarter decline was driven in part by Peru's economic slowdown. Credicorp controls Peru's biggest bank, Banco de Credito <CRE.LM>, and also owns a pension fund.
