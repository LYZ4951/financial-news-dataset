July 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wessex Water Services  Limited's (WWSL) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', senior  unsecured rating at 'A-' and Short-term IDR at 'F2'. The Outlook on the  Long-term IDR is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this  press release.  The affirmation reflects WWSL's market-leading operational and regulatory  performance as well as the negative impact from the material reduction of  earnings expected for the upcoming regulatory period from April 2015 to March  2020 (asset management plan 6; AMP6). Fitch forecast financial ratios will  remain within guidance for the rating, given the company's track record of  outperforming the regulator's cost targets and the low cash cost of its embedded  debt.KEY RATING DRIVERS Material Reduction of Earnings in the Sector The regulator has guided towards a cost of capital of 3.85% for the regulated  companies, lower than Fitch had expected. Companies may be able to earn  additional returns from incentives. Taking into account draft determinations  published to date, it appears that efficiency targets for total expenditure in  the wholesale price controls may leave some room for outperformance, whereas  allowances for the retail price controls are challenging and may offset some or  all of the savings from the wholesale business.  Assumptions for the Forecast Fitch assumed for the rating forecast that WWSL will earn the cost of capital of  3.85%, achieve at least 5% outperformance relating to pay as you go expenditure  (excluding infrastructure renewal) and receive revenue adjustments from the last  price control of GBP44.7m as declared in its revised business plan submission  (ie capital incentive scheme, opex roller, revenue correction mechanism and  service incentive mechanism (SIM). The agency has also considered that the  company may have to pay pension deficit repair in excess of regulatory  allowances.  Credit Metrics Remain Comfortably Within Guidelines Fitch forecasts pension-adjusted net debt/regulatory asset value close to 70%,  which is also the maximum guideline for the current rating. Post-maintenance and  post-tax interest cover (PMICR) is expected to range between 1.6x and 1.9x (1.7x  the five-year average), comfortably above the minimum guideline of 1.5x. Fitch notes that management can directly influence gearing through the dividend  policy. A lot of shareholders in the infrastructure space distribute the maximum  amount to comply with a target capital structure, in this case 70%. Management  has less means to steer reported interest cover. The forecast PMICR of 1.7x for  WWSL is strong in comparison with many peers and supported by the company's  track record of outperforming regulatory allowances and the low cash cost of its  embedded debt (FY14 close to 3.25%).Market-Leading Operational Performance In FY14 WWSL achieved a SIM score of 87, ranking joint-first with Anglian Water  according to preliminary data. The company maintained stable asset  serviceability for all asset categories, met leakage targets and reduced the  number of repeat flooding incidents. Only the number of serious pollution  incidents exceeded the target during the year following exceptional rainfall and  management is making every effort to restore previous performance levels.  Overall, WWSL is clearly the market leading company in the sector.   LIQUIDITY As of 31 March 2014, WWSL held GBP88m in cash and cash equivalents and had  available GBP100m of undrawn, committed bank facilities (a term loan with  long-term maturity once drawn) against debt falling due over the next two years  of GBP128.6m. This funding position will provide sufficient liquidity for  capital expenditure, operating requirements, refinancing and dividends until the  end of 2015.RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead to a positive rating action  include:  - A sustainable reduction in target gearing to below 65% and PMICR above 1.8x. Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - A marked deterioration in operating and regulatory performance or financial  policies leading to PMICR below 1.5x and regulatory gearing above 70%. - Adverse changes to the regulatory framework.
