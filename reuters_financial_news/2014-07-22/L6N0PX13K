DUBAI, July 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's bourse is set to rise on Tuesday after the cabinet said it had given permission to the financial regulator to open the market to direct investment by foreign financial institutions.

"The cabinet authorised the Capital Market Authority - at a time it sees as appropriate - to allow foreign financial institutions to buy and sell stocks on the Saudi stock market, according to rules to be laid down by the CMA," the cabinet said in a one-sentence statement.  The statement did not specify a timetable for the market to be opened, or give any details of the rules under which the reform would take place. That suggested the actual start of trade could still be weeks or months away.

"I think this is very positive news for Saudi Arabia," said Sanyalak Manibhandu, manager of research at NBAD Securities in Abu Dhabi. "There are many attractions to investing: the market in Saudi is much more diversified than elsewhere in the Gulf, the market cap is bigger and the traded volume and traded value are much bigger." Saudi Arabia <.TASI> has a capitalisation of $530 billion, dwarfing Qatar <.QSI> with about $146 billion and the United Arab Emirates, where Dubai <.DFMGI> and Abu Dhabi <.ADI> are capitalised at $86 billion and $127 billion respectively. However, up 14.2 percent this year, Saudi Arabia lags all three in terms of performance, as Dubai has gained 40.2 percent, Qatar 26.1 percent and Abu Dhabi 16.3 percent. Blue chips such as Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) <2010.SE>, which accounts for quarter of the Saudi market's total corporate profit, looks set to attract interest on Tuesday as local investors try to front-run the entry of foreigners. Among other high-profile blue chips are Saudi Telecom <7010.SE>, the biggest listed lender Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, and Kingdom Holding <4280.SE>, the investment firm owned by billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Some traders, however, said smaller stocks favoured by Saudi stocks favoured by retail investors - such as Alinma bank <1150.SE> - could also surge on Tuesday because of the euphoria. The Saudi stock index, which last closed at 9,750 points, faces resistance at 9,934 points, the multi-year peak hit in June.
