BUENOS AIRES, July 22 (Reuters) - Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez was meeting her economy minister on Tuesday to decide whether to send a team to debt negotiations in New York on Wednesday, a government source said.

"At the moment, the economic team is meeting with the president ... to evaluate all options," the source said on condition of anonymity.   A U.S. judge earlier ordered Argentina and investors who did not participate in the country's past debt restructurings to meet "continuously" with a court-appointed mediator until a settlement is reached, warning of the threat of a new default.
