WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - A New York-based investor relations executive on Tuesday agreed to settle civil charges that he illegally traded with inside information obtained while preparing press releases for company clients, U.S. regulators said.

Kevin McGrath of Cameron Associates will pay a little more than $25,000 in penalties, disgorgement and prejudgment interest, the Securities and Exchange Commission said.
