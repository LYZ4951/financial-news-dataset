July 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says it expects the major Swedish  banks in 2H14 to continue to see robust performance, while maintaining large  capital and liquidity buffers - all fundamental factors that are key to  supporting their high ratings.The four large Swedish commercial banks, Nordea Bank AB <NDA.ST> (AA-/Stable), Svenska  Handelsbanken AB <SHBa.ST> (AA-/Stable), Swedbank AB <SWEDa.ST> (A+/Positive) and Skandinavinska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB; A+/Positive) are among the highest-rated banks by Fitch  (see "Peer Review: Large Swedish and Finnish Banks", available on  www.fitchratings.com). The first half of 2014 was no exception to the major Swedish banks' strong track  record. Capital buffers are increasing and Basel 3 common equity Tier 1 ratios  ranged between 15.2% (Nordea Bank) to 20.9% (Swedbank) at end-June 2014. With  currently limited credit growth expectations in most of the Swedish banks' core  operating markets, the Swedish authorities' proposed higher capital requirements  for these banks will likely determine the dividend pay-out ratio in 2014.
