BUENOS AIRES, July 22 (Reuters) - Argentine over-the-counter bonds reversed gains on Tuesday after a U.S. judge said there was no need to suspend his ruling in Argentina's legal battle against holdout investors in order for them to reach settlement.

Argentina's dollar-denominated 2023 Par <ARPARD=RASL> was down 0.3 percent while the dollar-denominated Discount 2033 <ARDISCD=RASL> fell 1.25 percent, Reuters data showed.
