HONG KONG, July 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index jumped to its highest in nearly 7-1/2 months on Tuesday, helped by stronger Chinese markets on the mainland and recent fund inflows which pushed up the territory's blue-chip stocks.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> rose 1.7 percent to 23,782.11 points, its highest since Dec. 9. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong climbed 2.4 percent to close at its highest since Jan. 2. Gains were seen across the board. Index heavyweights HSBC Holdings PLC <0005.HK> added 1.3 percent and insurer AIA <1299.HK> 3.3 percent.  Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> spiked 2.1 percent, partly lifted by peer Baidu's <BIDU.O> record high close in New York.
