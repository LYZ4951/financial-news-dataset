BRASILIA, July 22 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government on Tuesday reduced its economic growth forecast for this year to 1.8 percent from 2.5 percent, a prediction that remains well above market economists' estimates for an expansion of less than 1 percent.

The government raised its inflation forecast to 6.2 percent in 2014 from a previous estimate of 5.6 percent, according to a fiscal report released by the planning ministry.
