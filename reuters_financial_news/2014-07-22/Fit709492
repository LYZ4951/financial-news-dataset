July 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Japan-based Shizuoka  Bank, Ltd.'s <8355.T> (Shizuoka) and Suruga Bank Ltd.'s <8358.T> (Suruga) Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) at 'A' and 'A-', respectively. The Outlooks are Stable. A full  list of the rating actions is provided at the end of this rating action  commentary.   KEY RATING DRIVERS - VIABILITY RATING (VR) AND IDRs The IDRs of Shizuoka and Suruga are driven by their VRs. Like major banks in  Japan, most regional banks remain exposed to a challenging operating environment  with uncertainties over the sustainability of Abenomics. Nevertheless, the  Stable Outlook for both banks' IDRs reflects their resilient financial profile  underpinned by adequate risk controls. Shizuoka's VR ('a') reflects its sustained strong capitalisation (Fitch Core  Capital ratio of 17.3% at end-March 2014), leading franchise in the regional  economy of Shizuoka Prefecture and potential buffer against credit risk through  a high level of guarantee/collateral coverage, including public guarantees.  Suruga's VR ('a-') continues to factor in decent profitability by Japanese  standards (ROA at 0.7% compared with mega banks' average of 0.5% for the year  ended March 2014) and consistent internal capital generation.  Funding and liquidity remain key positive features of the Japanese banking  system and also are the major drivers for the two banks' ratings. Constraining factors for Shizuoka's ratings include its limited options for  diversification in its revenue base, which currently relies on lending in the  Shizuoka Prefecture. Suruga's ratings are constrained by a lack of diversification as a result of  concentration in retail lending and its small asset size (consolidated total  assets of JPY4trn compared with Shizuoka's JPY11trn at end-March 2014).  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VR AND IDRs A positive rating action for Shizuoka is unlikely given Japan's sovereign rating  is at 'A+', with a Negative Outlook.  For Suruga, positive action would likely stem from further structural  improvement in the domestic operating environment leading to stronger loan  growth and faster internal capital generation without a material increase in  risk appetite. However, Fitch believes such structural improvement to be remote.  For both banks, substantial deterioration in the operating environment resulting  in greater volatility in performance, including through taking more risk to  offset the impact of the operating environment, could exert negative pressures  on the VRs and IDRs. This would include larger exposure to market risk, which is  currently viewed as manageable.KEY RATING DRIVERS -SUPPORT RATING (SR) AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR (SRF) Both banks' SRs and SRFs are affirmed on the basis that the Japanese  government's propensity to support the domestic banking sector remains  unchanged.  Shizuoka's SR and SRF reflect Fitch's belief that the government's propensity to  support, if necessary, is strong. On the other hand, the propensity to support  Suruga may be limited given the bank's marginal systemic importance within  Japan's financial system and its small operational size.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SR AND SRF Shizuoka's SR of '2' and SRF of 'BBB-' are sensitive to changes to Japan's  sovereign rating, which underlines its ability to support the bank. Fitch  expects the bank's SR and SRF to be maintained, even if the sovereign's rating  is downgraded to 'A'. This is based on Fitch's belief that the government's  propensity to support Shizuoka, if necessary, remains strong. On the other hand,  Suruga's SR and SRF are not immediately sensitive to the sovereign rating, given  the limited probability of support.
