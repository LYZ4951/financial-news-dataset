LAGOS, July 22 (Reuters) - Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves climbed to $38.49 billion on July 18, a 3.8 percent increase on a month ago, when they were $37.09 billion, owing to a more stable local currency, data from central bank showed on Tuesday.

Nigeria's naira has remained stable against the U.S dollar in the past two weeks around 161.5-162.25, supported by slowing demand for the dollars and increased dollar flows from independent sources other than the central bank.
