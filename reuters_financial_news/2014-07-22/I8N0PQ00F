MUMBAI, July 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Idea Cellular <IDEA.NS>, India's third-biggest mobile phone operator by users and revenue, jumped 3.8 percent at pre-open trading after its first-quarter profit rose 57 percent to 7.28 billion rupees ($120.8 million), beating consensus estimates.

Idea's profits mainly got a boost from a rebound in voice as well as data realisations without any pressure on volumes, traders say. Analysts had expected Idea, part of India's Aditya Birla conglomerate and nearly a fifth-owned by Malaysia's Axiata AXIA.KL, to earn 6.29 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
