CAIRO, July 22 (Reuters) - Egypt's Commercial International Bank <COMI.CA>, the country's biggest listed bank, posted a 31 percent rise in net income in the first half of 2014, earning 1.74 billion Egyptian pounds ($797.20 million), the bank said on Tuesday.

The bank said it posted record revenue of 3.79 billion pounds, up 17 percent from the previous year. It said its net income for the second quarter rose to 932 million pounds, 39 percent up from the same period a year ago. "CIB stands ready to utilize its robust balance sheet to fund Egypt's expected economic recovery over the coming period," Hisham Ezz Al-Arab, the bank's chairman and managing director, said in a statement. Egyptian banks such as CIB have been able to keep bottom lines improving thanks partly to high interest rates paid by the state for its short-term borrowing. State borrowing costs rose as foreign investors exited the local Treasury market and as tax receipts suffered from a weak economy badly harmed by three years of turmoil following a 2011 popular uprising that ousted President Hosni Mubarak. CIB's second-quarter revenue stood at 2.035 million pounds.
