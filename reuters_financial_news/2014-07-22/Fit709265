July 22 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Torque Securitisation (RF)  Limited's ZAR250m class A4 notes a 'AAA(zaf)(EXP)' expected rating with Stable  Outlook. The proceeds of the issuance will redeem the class A1 notes on their scheduled  maturity date of 15 August 2014. The issuance's overall balance will remain  unchanged after the refinance. The notes are backed by a revolving pool of South African auto loan receivables  originated by Iemas Financial Services (Co-operative) Limited (Iemas, not  rated). Iemas is the largest financial services trade co-operative in South  Africa and has been originating auto loans since 1993.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Salary Deduction Drives Performance The pool's historical default rate performance has been in line with European  auto transactions, despite South Africa's higher unemployment rate and more  volatile economic environment. This performance is driven by the fact that the  majority of loans are repaid via salary deduction. Since inception in 2012, the  transaction has recorded a total of 1.7% defaults. Fitch has set a base case default assumption of 3.8% with multiples slightly  above the criteria's median (5.25x for 'AAA(zaf)'), and a recovery rate base  case of 50%, with median stresses (50% for 'AAA(zaf)').   Employer Concentration Risk The transaction is exposed to employer concentration risk as Iemas targets large  employers across South Africa, originating loans to their respective employees.  This risk is mitigated by concentration limits built into the transaction. Fitch  has carried out scenario analysis of the effect of insolvency of the top  employers and is comfortable that available credit enhancement is sufficient to  cover for potential additional defaults stemming from this risk.   Documentation Weaknesses Fitch has identified some weaknesses in the transaction documentation where  definitions or descriptions conflict or include, in Fitch's view, manifest  errors. Fitch understands from the originator and the administrator that these  issues are unintended and that the transaction documents will be amended -  subject to noteholder consent - to reflect the intended structure by October  2014.  Given the currently stable performance Fitch does not view the weaknesses as an  imminent risk. However, should the transaction documentation not be amended in  due course, the ratings could be negatively affected.  Evergreen Transaction, Subsequent Issuances The transaction featured an initial two-year revolving period, which can be  extended continuously by two years. The purchase of additional assets during the  revolving period will be subject to various eligibility covenants. Moreover, the  transaction allows for additional issuances of notes of varying maturity and  seniority. Fitch will carry out a full rating analysis upon each future  issuance.   Counterparty Risk Outsourced Securitisation Services (Pty) Ltd (a subsidiary of Deloitte South  Africa) has been mandated as back-up servicer and receives monthly portfolio  information. In addition, the transaction benefits from a liquidity facility  provided by (FirstRand Bank Limited [FSRJHB.UL], AA(zaf)/Stable/F1+(zaf)) that is sufficient  to cover around three months of senior fees and interest. Both measures should  support a smooth transition of servicing if needed.  Stable Asset Outlook Fitch has a stable asset outlook for South African consumer ABS transactions.  While a mild slowdown in the South African economy is expected over the next 12  months, the agency believes that defaults are likely to remain within base-case  expectations, as they already incorporate Fitch's short-term macroeconomic  expectations. Credit enhancement is provided via overcollateralisation which is funded via the  junior notes and the subordinated loan, and a cash reserve fund of 1%, which was  also funded via the subordinated loan. For example, the class A notes benefit  from 23.8% credit enhancement, which is provided by 22.8% overcollateralisation  and the 1% cash reserve.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Unexpected Deterioration in Portfolio Performance Unexpected increases in the default rate and loss severity on defaulted loans  could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's assumptions and could result in  potential rating actions on the notes. Rating sensitivity of the class A notes to increased default rate assumptions: Current rating: 'AAA(zaf)(EXP)' Increase in default rate by 10%: 'AA+(zaf)(EXP)' Increase in default rate by 25%: 'AA(zaf)(EXP)' Increase in default rate by 50%: 'A+(zaf)(EXP)'  Rating sensitivity of the class A notes to reduced recovery rate assumptions: Current rating: 'AAA(zaf)(EXP)' Decrease in recovery rate by 10%: 'AA+(zaf)(EXP)' Decrease in recovery rate by 25%: 'AA+(zaf)(EXP)' Decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'AA+(zaf)(EXP)'  Rating sensitivity of the class A notes to multiple factors: Current rating: 'AAA(zaf)(EXP)' Increase in default rate by 10%, decrease in recovery rate by 10%:  'AA+(zaf)(EXP)' Increase in default rate by 25%, decrease in recovery rate by 25%:  'AA-(zaf)(EXP)' Increase in default rate by 50%, decrease in recovery rate by 50%: 'A(zaf)(EXP)' Upon completion of the refinancing the capital structure will be as follows:  ZAR238m Class A2: 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable ZAR200m Class A3: 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable ZAR250m Class A4: 'AAA(zaf)'; Outlook Stable ZAR84m Class B: 'A+(zaf)'; Outlook StableZAR49m Class C: 'BBB(zaf)'; Outlook  Stable ZAR70m Class D: Not rated Fitch expects to affirm the above ratings on the refinance date.
