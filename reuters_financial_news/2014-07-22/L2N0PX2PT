BOGOTA, July 22 (Reuters) - Investment bank J.P. Morgan will not increase the weighting of Colombia's peso-denominated debt in one of its closely followed emerging market bond indices, the company said on Tuesday, correcting a note it issued earlier in the day.

J.P. Morgan will keep a 7.8 percent weighting of six Treasury bonds, known as TES, in its GBI-EM Global Diversified index.  Due to a typographical error, the company had incorrectly said it was setting a weighting of 8.8 percent for the six instruments that mature in 2016, 2018, 2019, 2022, 2024 and 2028.
