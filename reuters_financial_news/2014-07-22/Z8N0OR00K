ZURICH, July 22 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse reported its biggest quarterly loss since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, due to a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.78 billion) charge taken following a May settlement with U.S. authorities over tax evasion charges.

The Zurich-based bank swung to a second-quarter loss of 700 million francs. A Reuters analyst poll called for a 581 million franc net loss.
