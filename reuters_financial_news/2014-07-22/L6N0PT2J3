MOSCOW, July 21 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest food retailer, Magnit <MGNT.MM>, is expected to report a 17 percent increase in quarterly net income and revise its full-year guidance upwards, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Tuesday.

The company is expected to report a net profit of $310 million, the average of estimates from 11 banks and brokerages showed, compared with $265 million a year ago. Underlying profitability is expected to decline slightly but come above the company's guidance, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) seen at 10.7 percent of sales, down from 10.9 percent a year ago. "With room for further purchasing gains and no dramatic, sustained changes in the competitive environment, we think the risk to management's current full-year EBITDA margin guidance of about 10.5 percent remains to the upside," said David Ferguson, an analyst at Renaissance Capital. Analysts at Otkritie expect the company to raise its forecast for sales growth this year. Magnit currently expects 22-24 percent growth in 2014 but is expected to raise its guidance to 25-28 percent after strong second-quarter trading.
