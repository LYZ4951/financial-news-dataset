JAKARTA, July 22 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares surrendered early gains and fell more than 1 percent on Tuesday on worries about potential unrest after the likely loser in presidential elections attempted to delay the official result.

The benchmark Jakarta composite index was down 1.2 percent at 5,066 points by mid-afternoon. Some of the biggest losers included PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk <TLKM.JK> and PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia Tbk <BBRI.JK>, which declined more than 3 percent each. "The market is anticipating reaction from the losing side, they are concerned that there may be some clashes," said Muhamad Alfatih, an analyst with Samuel Sekuritas in Jakarta. Prabowo Subianto, the likely loser in Indonesia's presidential race, made a last-gasp attempt to delay the announcement of the official election results on Tuesday. Jakarta Governor Joko "Jokowi" Widodo is widely expected to be declared as the nation's next leader. [ID:nL4N0PX188]
