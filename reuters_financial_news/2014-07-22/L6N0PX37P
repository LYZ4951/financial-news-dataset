LISBON, July 22 (Reuters) - Portugal's beleaguered Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> postponed the release of its first-half results to July 30 from July 25, the country's largest listed bank said in a statement on Tuesday, without providing explanations.

BES' main shareholders - the Espirito Santo banking family that founded the bank more than a century ago - have been under intense investor and regulator scrutiny after an audit found material irregularities at one of family holding companies.
