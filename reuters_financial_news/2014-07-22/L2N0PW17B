NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Two executives from collapsed mega law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf have settled claims they mismanaged the firm by negotiating themselves pay packages totaling $21.8 million, according to court papers.

A single-sentence order announcing the settlement was filed on Tuesday by Judge Martin Glenn in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The terms of the deal could not immediately be determined.  Stephen DiCarmine, Dewey's former executive administrator, and Joel Sanders, a former chief financial officer, had faced a lawsuit brought by Dewey bankruptcy trustee Alan Jacobs, who accused them of negotiating "sweetheart" pay deals with Dewey chairman Steven Davis, effective between 2008 and 2013 as the firm was failing, according to a court papers. Ned Bassen, a lawyer for Sanders, did not respond to a request for comment. Mary Beth Buchanan, a lawyer for DiCarmine, declined comment. Jacobs as well as Diamond McCarthy, the law firm handling the case for him, declined to comment. The settlement is the latest development in efforts to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars for Dewey creditors in the wake of the firm's May 2012 collapse, the largest law firm bankruptcy in U.S. history. Dewey once employed more than 1,000 lawyers. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office still has criminal charges pending against DiCarmine and Sanders, claiming they used fraudulent accounting practices to cover up the state of Dewey's finances leading up to its collapse. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Bankruptcy trustee Jacobs sued DiCarmine and Sanders in November 2013 seeking $21.8 million. He claimed they had signed six-year contracts that guaranteed them fixed salaries of $5.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, until 2013, on top of fixed and discretionary bonuses while Dewey was insolvent and revenue was plummeting. "At worst, the insider deals were outright shams arranged by a group of greedy and unscrupulous business associates to enrich themselves at the expense of (Dewey) and its creditors," Jacobs said in the lawsuit.  DiCarmine and Sanders had filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in May, saying they had "provided value as senior managers ... and the payments to them were made in the ordinary course pursuant to existing contracts." Attempts to reach DiCarmine and Sanders directly were unsuccessful.  In October 2012, a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved a $71.5 million settlement between the Dewey estate and former partners, who were required to pay between $5,000 and $3.5 million individually, in exchange for being released from potential lawsuits over the firm's debts.
