BUDAPEST, July 22 (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary cut its base interest rate by 20 basis points on Tuesday, bringing it to a record low 2.1 percent <NBHI> as evidence of falling price pressures gave it further room to help the economic recovery.

The 24th successive monthly reduction in the base rate was bigger than expected, as analysts in a Reuters poll last week all predicted a 10 basis point cut as in previous months.[ID:nL6N0PS3GU] The forint <EURHUF=D3> traded at 309.70 versus the euro, weaker than 309.20 just before the announcement.
