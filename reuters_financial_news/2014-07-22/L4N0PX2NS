BANGKOK, July 22 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares snapped two days of gains and fell on Tuesday amid worries about potential unrest over the presidential election result while the Thai index hit a near two-week low on selling in telecoms and construction shares.

The likely loser in Indonesia's presidential race made a last-gasp attempt to delay the announcement of the official election results on Tuesday, expected to declare Jakarta Governor Joko "Jokowi" Widodo as the nation's next leader. [ID:nL4N0PX188] Former general Prabowo Subianto withdrew his presidential candidacy after denouncing the election process as undemocratic, an official from his party said on Tuesday. [ID:nL4N0PX2K5] "The presidential race was tight and Prabowo finished a press conference, stating that he rejected the presidential election," said Jakarta-based John Teja, director of broker Ciptadana Securities. Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> fell as much as 2.2 percent to the lowest since July 14. It closed down 0.9 percent after notching a combined 1.1 percent gain over the past two  sessions. Domestic investors led sellers of shares in large cap companies such as Telekomunikasi Indonesia <TLKM.JK>. The market posted a modest net foreign buying worth 6.0 billion rupiah ($518,200) after Monday's 22.8 billion rupiah ($1.97 million) of outflows, Thomson Reuters data showed. <.VMFIN.JK> The Thai index <.SETI> was down 1.2 percent at 1,520.81, the lowest since July 10. Shares of top telecom firm Advanced Info Service <ADVANC.BK> slid 3.7 percent, taking its loss in three days to almost 9 percent, after the military government postponed last week an auction of fourth generation (4G) mobile phone bandwidth. [ID:nL4N0PT1HV] Shares of Ch Karnchang <CK.BK> and other builders suffered late selling after the government said its meeting earlier on the day did not discuss infrastructure investments as investors earlier expected.
