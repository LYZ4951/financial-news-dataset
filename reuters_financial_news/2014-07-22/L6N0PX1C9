DUBAI, July 22 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi-based investment firm Waha Capital <WAHA.AD> said on Tuesday its net profit for the second quarter of 2014 jumped on the back of a one-off gain from its investment in AerCap Holdings <AER.N>.

Waha, whose shareholders include Abu Dhabi government entities, made 1.14 billion dirhams ($310.4 million) in the three months to June 30, up from 38.4 million dirhams in the year-ago period, it said in a bourse filing. AerCap Holdings, in which Waha was its largest shareholder, bought American International Group's <AIG.N> aircraft leasing business in a $5.4 billion cash and share deal. [ID:nL1N0O027A] "Waha Capital booked a one-off gain related to the transaction, and recorded a higher earnings contribution from AerCap, because of the increase in scale, valuation and earnings per share at the aircraft leasing company," its earnings statement said.
