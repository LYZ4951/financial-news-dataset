July 22 (Reuters) - Britain's Arbuthnot Banking Group <ARBB.L> posted a nearly five-fold rise in first-half pretax profit as its Secure Trust Bank <STBS.L> unit continued to expand its rapidly growing customer base.

Arbuthnot, which has its roots in 181-year-old private bank and wealth manager Arbuthnot Latham, said net interest income rose to 41.1 million pounds ($70.2 million) in the six months ended June 30, from 30.1 million pounds a year earlier. [ID:nRSV9054Ma]
