SAO PAULO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Consumer delinquencies in Brazil fell in 2013 for the first time in 14 years, a research firm said on Tuesday, mostly reflecting a decision among private-sector lenders to put the brakes on rapid loan disbursements.

Consumer delinquencies including unpaid utility bills, bank loan defaults and bounced checks fell 2 percent last year, compared with a surge of 15 percent in 2012, credit research company Serasa Experian said in a report. The drop in the indicator was driven by a 9.4 percent slump in the number of bounced checks. Although loan delinquencies rose 0.6 percent last year, the average value of bank debts remained stable, a sign that borrowers turned more cautious with credit after years of rampant debt-taking, Serasa said. Serasa's delinquencies numbers employ a different methodology than the central bank's credit market data - which is widely used as a market benchmark among investors. The numbers could at first glance spell a brighter outlook for private-sector lenders, which have seen quarterly profit recover recently thanks to prudence in their credit disbursement policies. Fierce competition by state-run banks is losing steam, helping lending margins in the banking system recoup some of the erosion suffered since late 2011. "Low unemployment rates, increased prudence in credit disbursements among financial institutions and growing worries among consumers over the repayment of their debts were the main engine behind the drop in defaults," the report added. A decline in defaults underpins the benefits of a de-risking strategy, in which private-sector banks gave up rapid growth in their loans in order to lower bad loan provisions and stay profitable. Yet, some analysts have questioned whether the trend in delinquencies is sustainable, with Brazil's labor market experiencing a slight deterioration and interest rates rising to their highest level in three years as inflation accelerates.   Banking shares rose following the Serasa report. Preferred shares of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA>, Brazil's largest bank by market value, rose 0.9 percent to 30.02 reais. Shares of Banco Bradesco SA <BBDC4.SA> gained 0.9 percent, while those of state-run Banco do Brasil SA <BBAS3.SA> went up 0.2 percent. The central bank releases full-year credit data for Brazil's banking system on Jan. 23.
