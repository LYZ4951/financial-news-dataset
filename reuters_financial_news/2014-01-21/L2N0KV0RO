WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - There is as high as a one-in-five chance that prices could start to fall in the euro zone, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist said on Tuesday.

"Our model gives a 10 to 20 percent probability to inflation turning negative (in the euro zone)," Olivier Blanchard told reporters on a conference call, adding that the IMF still sees positive price growth in its baseline forecasts.
