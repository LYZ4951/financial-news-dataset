SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Foreign net investment in South Korean domestic bonds will likely post the first gain in six months as demand among foreign investors remains stable, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters on Tuesday.

Net foreign investment in domestic bonds rose by about 400 billion won ($376.06 million) this month to Jan. 17 and will likely post a gain by the end of the month, Gwak Bum-gook, head of the ministry's treasury bureau, said in an interview.
