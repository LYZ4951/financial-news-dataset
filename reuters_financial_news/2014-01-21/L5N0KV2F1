BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's executive board will be complete again as of Jan. 27, when Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger officially replaces Joerg Asmussen, who left to rejoin the German government.

The European Council on Tuesday approved Lautenschlaeger's appointment for an eight-year term starting next Monday.  Asmussen left the ECB on Jan. 7, two years into his eight-year term, to become state secretary in the labour ministry.
