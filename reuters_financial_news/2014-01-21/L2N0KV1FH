NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp <CMCSA.O> has added Barclays PLC <BARC.L> as an adviser as the top U.S. cable provider evaluates a potential deal for Time Warner Cable Inc <TWC.N>, according to people familiar with the matter.

Comcast hired Barclays late last year to review its deal options, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> that it had earlier tapped for advice, the people said. The people asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives from Comcast and Barclays declined to comment.
