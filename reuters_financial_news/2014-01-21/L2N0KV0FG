BRASILIA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Brazil's annual inflation rate probably eased slightly in the month to mid-January, offering little relief to policymakers even after a series of interest rate hikes aimed at reining in consumer prices.

The IPCA-15 price index <BRIPCY=ECI> likely rose 5.76 percent in the 12-month period through January 15, down from a 5.85-percent increase one month before, according to the median of 22 forecasts in the survey. Brazil's inflation has remained stubbornly high for more than three years, prompting the central bank to make seven consecutive interest rate hikes since April in a bid to restore investors' confidence. Economists said the mid-January inflation figure will help show if a surprise jump in consumer prices in December was only temporary or if it is likely to persist. Last month's inflation rate <BRCPI=ECI> was the main reason why the central bank's monetary policy committee Copom raised interest rates by 50 basis points last week, and not by 25 points as most economists expected, analysts said. [ID:nL2N0KP0J6] Brazil's central bank sets its benchmark interest rate in an effort to steer inflation toward a target range of 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  "Given that the higher-than-expected inflation result of 2013 seems to have been an important reason for the Copom to maintain the 50-bp pace of rate hikes, upcoming inflation results should have relevant impact on the local market," economists at Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco wrote in a research note on Monday. Statistics agency IBGE will release its mid-month inflation report on Thursday at 9 a.m. local time (1100 GMT), just half an hour after the central bank publishes the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting. Brazil's benchmark lending rate <BRCBMP=ECI> is currently at 10.50 percent. Month-on-month inflation <BRIPCA=ECI> likely edged up to 0.80 percent as a sharp increase in food prices offset a smaller rise in transportation and services costs, according to the median of 28 forecasts. Prices measured by the index rose 0.75 percent in mid-December. According to Credit Suisse, food prices probably jumped 1.12 percent in the month to mid-January, up from 0.40 percent in the prior month, due to a sharp increase in meats, baked goods and fruits. Service-sector prices probably eased as a result of lower airfares, the bank's analysts added.
