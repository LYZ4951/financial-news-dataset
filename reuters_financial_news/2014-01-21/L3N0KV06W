SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Swiss industrial group Klesch is considering buying the refining unit of Canada's Harvest Operations, a South Korean business daily said on Tuesday, as Harvest-owner Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) trims its overseas assets.

Klesch has hired Deutsche Bank to conduct so-called due diligence on a possible purchase of Harvest's refining subsidiary, North Atlantic Refining, the Korean Economic Daily reported, citing investment banking sources. A spokesman for state-run KNOC declined to comment on the issue. KNOC, which bought Harvest for $1.7 billion in 2009, posted a net loss of 904 billion won ($850 million) in 2012 and a 162.5 billion won loss for the first six months of 2013, mainly due to higher refining costs and worsening margins at the Canadian company.
