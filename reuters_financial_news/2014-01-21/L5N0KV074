DUBAI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding <4280.SE>, the investment firm of billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, posted a 10.3 percent increase in fourth-quarter net profit on Tuesday, mainly due to a rise in the value of its investments.    Kingdom made a net profit of 231.2 million Saudi riyals ($61.65 million) for the quarter compared with a profit of 209.6 mln riyals for the year-ago period, it said in a bourse statement.
