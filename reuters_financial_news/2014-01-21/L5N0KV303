MADRID, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Spain's Bankinter <BKT.MC> is expected to post a 70 percent jump in full-year profits for 2013 on Wednesday, as net income from lending improved in the fourth quarter and the bank took lower provisions against losses than the year before.

The mid-sized lender is forecast to post a net profit of 211.5 million euros ($287 million) for 2013, according to the averaged predictions of seven analysts polled by Reuters. Investors will be examining whether Bankinter, the seventh biggest bank in Spain by market value, can deliver the forecast 15 percent rise in net interest income (NII) in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the last three months of 2012. Net interest income is the difference between a bank's funding costs and what it earns from loans. Spanish lenders' funding costs have improved as they recovered from a 2008 real estate market collapse and as the euro zone crisis abated, but interest rates are still at historic lows, which is eating into margins. NII at Bankinter is still forecast to drop for the whole of 2013 compared to 2012.  Following are the results of the poll in simple averages and millions of euros.
