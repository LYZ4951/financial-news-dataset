COPENHAGEN, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Denmark should reform the auction system of its $500 billion mortgage bond industry despite strong opposition to the proposal from investors, Danish central bank governor Lars Rohde wrote in a letter to business daily Borsen on Tuesday.

The unusual step by Rohde emphasised the central bank's backing of the government's proposal, which he said would support financial stability by automatically extending maturities for adjustable-rate bonds if auctions were to fail. Danish households are among the world's most highly leveraged, with debt at around three times the annual disposable income. Around half of all mortgages are one-year adjustable rate loans. The government is proposing that if a refinancing auction fails, or produces an interest rate more than 5 percentage points higher than the rate the bond originally offered, then the bond would be extended by 12 months at a time. Critics of the bill say investors no will longer be able to know when they can expect to get their money back or which interest they can expect to earn if the proposal is passed by parliament. "The bill will create clarity about what will happen when a large increase in interest rates or a failed auction takes place," Rohde wrote in the letter. "There is no need to sow uncertainty about the solution or uncertainty about the willingness to solve the refinancing problem," he added. Danish mortgage bond volumes are more than four times the size of the country's government bond market and also exceeds the annual gross domestic product.
