DUBAI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Kuwait Projects Co <KPRO.KW> (KIPCO) has chosen three banks to arrange meetings with fixed income investors ahead of a possible dollar-denominated bond issue, a document from lead managers said on Tuesday.

The firm has hired BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, HSBC <HSBA.L> and JP Morgan Chase <JPM.N> to arrange the roadshows, which will take place in Asia, the Middle East and Europe starting on Jan. 23. A dollar-denominated bond issue may follow the roadshows, subject to market conditions, the statement added.
