BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK>, Thailand's second-largest lender by assets, reported a higher than expected 45 percent rise in 2013 net profit, thanks to strong loan growth, higher net interest and fee income.     The state-controlled bank posted a net profit of 33.9 billion baht ($1.03 billion) in 2013, with lending up by 11.8 percent, it said in a statement.

That compared with 23.4 billion baht in 2012 and the average 30.7 billion baht forecast by seven analysts polled by Reuters.
