LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The euro briefly fell against the dollar on Tuesday after the closely-watched German ZEW economic sentiment indicator came in below forecasts, potentially signalling some softness in Europe's largest economy.

The single currency fell as low as $1.3525 <EUR=>, down from $1.3538, although it later recovered those losses and was last trading down 0.1 percent at $1.3536.
