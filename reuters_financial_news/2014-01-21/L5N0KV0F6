HELSINKI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - British engineering company Rolls-Royce <RR.L> is expected to make a public offer on the Finnish ship and power plant engine maker Wartsila <WRT1V.HE>, a Finnish newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed investors.

Wartsila declined to comment on the report and Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Earlier this month, the companies said Rolls-Royce had made a preliminary approach to Wartsila, but the talks ended without a deal. Wartsila clarified to Reuters that the British company had been interested in buying its entire business. [ID:nL6N0KJ0N9] According to the report by Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, investors said Rolls-Royce has been planning to pay at least 50 euros per Wartsila share, which would value the company at around 9.9 billion euros ($13.4 billion). The stock closed at 40.68 euros on Monday. By buying Wartsila, Rolls-Royce - the world's second-largest aircraft engine maker - would strengthen its marine business, which lowered its profit guidance in November.
