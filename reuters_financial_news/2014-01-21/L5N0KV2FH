ABUJA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank left its benchmark interest rate at 12 percent for the fourteenth time in a row on Tuesday but tightened the cash reserve requirement on public sector deposits to 75 percent, from 50 percent.

Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi noted that inflation was stable but said the monetary policy committee was concerned about a decrease in Nigeria's crude oil savings and inflows from portfolio investors.
