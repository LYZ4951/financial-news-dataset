LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Britain's accounting watchdog has launched an investigation into the conduct of Chris Willford, former group finance director at Bradford & Bingley bank.

The Financial Reporting Council said on Tuesday it has launched the action after another regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, fined Willford 30,000 pounds ($49,300) in December for failures during an emergency cash call at the bank. The bank was eventually split into two, its deposits and branches were sold to Santander <SAN.MC>, while its loans remained with the government.
