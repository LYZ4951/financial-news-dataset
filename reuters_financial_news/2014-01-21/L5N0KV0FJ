STOCKHOLM, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Swedish housing prices are likely to remain flat over the coming decade as more residential construction and tougher demands on banks take some of the air out of a market that has soared since the late 1990s, Sweden's finance minister said.

Finance Minister Anders Borg said in an interview with Svenska Dagbladet that obstacles such as a sprawling range of regulatory demands were holding back residential construction, above all in and around the Nordic country's biggest cities. "I think we should count on housing prices standing still over the coming ten years," he was quoted as saying. "The precondition for this is considerable changes in how the housing and construction markets work and that we over a long period place increasingly tough demands on the banking sector," he added. Surging housing prices have pushed up household indebtedness in recent years, with debts now standing at more than 170 percent of disposable income, one of the highest levels in Europe. This has caused many policymakers, including members of the Swedish central bank's executive board, to express concerns and call for more measures to curb the rise in lending.
