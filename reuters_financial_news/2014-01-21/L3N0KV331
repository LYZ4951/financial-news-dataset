MUMBAI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - IndoSpace, a property fund jointly owned by India's Everstone Capital and North American investor Realterm Global, has raised $330 million for a fund that will invest in industrial real estate in the country, the company said on Tuesday.

IndoSpace is developing about 32 million square feet of large-scale modern industrial and warehousing facilities across Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Kolkata.
