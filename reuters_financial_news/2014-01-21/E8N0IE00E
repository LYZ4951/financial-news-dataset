BARCELONA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Shareholders of Spain's debt-laden Colonial <COL.MC> on Tuesday approved a restructuring plan that will see domestic holding company Villar Mir invest in the property developer, trumping a plan by Canada's Brookfield <BAMa.TO> to recapitalise the group.

The Villar Mir group, a family-owned company controlled by the chairman of Spanish builder OHL <OHL.MC>, and two other investment groups from South America and Andorra will invest 500 million euros in Colonial.
