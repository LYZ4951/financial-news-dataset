BUCHAREST, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Romania's stock market needs to offer a wider range of listings and make it easier for investors to buy shares, the manager of the country's main private investment fund said.

The $4.5 billion Fondul Proprietatea <FP.BX>, created to compensate Romanians whose assets were seized under communism, holds minority stakes in a slew of state-owned firms. With just over 80 listed companies and capitalisation of roughly 27 billion euros ($37 billion), Romania's stock market is only a fraction of the size of the region's biggest, Poland. "The main challenge for capital markets and for the fund are market regulations, barriers for investors to enter the market," manager Grzegorz Konieczny told Reuters in an interview. "If you look at foreign investors who have invested in Fondul, there are a lot of them who bought shares either through warrants issued by investment banks or swaps, and that is a fact that proves access to the local market is difficult for them." Fondul Proprietatea is managed by Franklin Templeton and has pushed successive governments in the EU's second poorest country to boost the efficiency of state-owned companies. Last year, the government launched its first initial public offerings in five years, listing minority stakes in nuclear power producer Nuclearelectrica <ROSNN.BX> and gas producer Romgaz <ROSNG.BX>, the latter done with shares in Bucharest and Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) in London. [ID:nL5N0IM0X3] "The IPOs always attract attention, said Konieczny, adding that the fact that the Romgaz IPO was executed by Goldman made "a huge, huge" change in terms of investor interest. "It's very important that especially these larger privatisations are done through global banks because to sell them they have to pick up coverage and start marketing."  DIVERSITY KEY Under an aid deal led by the International Monetary Fund, the government should launch IPOs in hydro power producer Hidroelectrica and coal-fired holding Oltenia this year.  "Right now it's really only the energy sector and banks, nothing else," Konieczny said of the Bucharest Stock Exchange.  "We're also talking to the government to really bring to the market Bucharest airports, Salrom, the port of Constanta." Templeton funds participated in all IPOs that have taken place in Bucharest, Konieczny said. He said the economy could grow 3 percent or more this year - above the government's 2.2 percent estimate - driven by exports, EU fund inflows and a pick-up in domestic demand. Fondul Proprietatea has been buying back its shares, seeking to narrow the discount to its net asset value, which was 33 percent in December.[ID:nL6N0JY132] In a move to raise cash for its buyback programmes, the Fund sold its 15 percent stake in state-owned gas grid operator Transgaz <ROTGN.BX> last month through an accelerated bookbuilding process. [ID:nL6N0JR175] Konieczny said the fund was less optimistic about Transgaz because it is subject to a regulated energy market. He said Fondul could always do the same with other firms in its portfolio. "Accelerated bookbuilding is much better for the market because it creates liquidity for future holders ... We have to be mindful of this because Fondul is very big compared to the size of the local market. If the local market doesn't grow, our job is not going to get any easier."
