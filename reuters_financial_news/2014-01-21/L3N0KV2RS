HONG KONG, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Former Fitch Ratings' analyst Charlene Chu, who has made a name for herself writing about risks to China's financial sector from rising debt levels, will join Autonomous Research, the independent research provider said on Tuesday.

Chu, famous for her research detailing the build up of so-called wealth management products in China, and the concern they posed to the country's financial system, said earlier this month that she was leaving the ratings agency. [ID:nL3N0KJ1LC] Autonomous, which provides research on the European and U.S. financial firms, was founded by former head of European banks equity research at Merrill Lynch, Stuart Graham, in 2009. Chu, a former Federal Reserve Bank executive, will join the firm as a partner to establish its Asian research operations and focus on China initially, Graham said in a statement.
