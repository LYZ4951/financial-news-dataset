PARIS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - European shares rose early on Tuesday with a key index hitting a fresh 5-1/2 year high, tracking gains in Asia as China's central bank injected funds to cool money market rates and ease the country's latest cash squeeze.

At 0808 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top  European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,347.32 points. China shares rebounded from six-month lows on Tuesday after cash rates eased following a move by the central bank to inject funds to soothe the latest cash crunch. [ID:nL3N0KV156] European spirits and luxury goods groups lost ground after France's Remy Cointreau <RCOP.PA> said quarterly sales sank 19 percent, with cognac sales plummeting 32 percent, as a Chinese government crackdown on ostentatious spending further hit demand. Remy was down 4.4 percent to a two-year low and rival Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> fell by 2.2 percent. LVMH <LVMH.PA> was down 0.5 percent. But the biggest loser among European blue-chips was Alstom <ALSO.PA>, down 12 percent after the power and transport engineering firm lowered its annual profit and cash flow targets on Tuesday. Alstrom blamed a slowdown in orders for coal and gas-fired power plants. [ID:nL5N0KV0BD]
