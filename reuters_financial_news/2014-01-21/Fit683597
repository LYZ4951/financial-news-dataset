Jan 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Last year set a record for the number of U.S. payment-in-kind (PIK) debt issues and 2013 was the third-highest in terms of issuance volumes since 2005, driven by dividend payouts to private equity sponsors and debt refinancing, according to a Fitch Ratings report. U.S. PIK issuance totaled $14.8 billion in 2013, surpassed only by levels in  2007 and 2008.  In total, there were 36 PIK notes issued in 2013.   Despite the resurgence in volumes, Fitch notes that PIK debt remains a both a  niche and relatively expensive product for deeply speculative-grade issuers. PIK  notes accounted for less than 5% of the $315 billion of U.S. high-yield debt  issued last year. The average interest rates on PIK debt issues completed over  the past eight years was approximately 10.5% cash and 11% in kind, (averages  include issues that have a combination coupon with PIK and cash components and  therefore an equal cash-pay and PIK coupon). The proceeds from many of the 2013 deals were used to fund dividend payouts to  enable private equity owners to cash out of a portion of their holdings or to  refinance existing debt and extend maturities.  Recent PIK transactions have  been structured more conservatively than pre-crisis issues, with inclusion of  contingent cash-pay features and less flexibility to pay in kind. Fitch analyzed the form of coupon payment (cash or kind) for 119 issues and  found moderate reliance on in-kind payments:  41% of issuers made all coupon  payments to date in cash, 29% made all payments in kind, and the remaining  issues had a payment history of both cash and in-kind payments. Fitch's analysis found that post-crisis PIK issuers were less leveraged one year  after their PIK debt issuance dates than pre-crisis PIK issuers. Fitch  calculated median debt leverage ratios of 7.2x for a group of 20 post-crisis  issuers versus 9.4x for a 25-member pre-crisis group based on LTM periods  following the PIK issuance dates. Similarly, the post-crisis group posted  stronger median FFO interest coverage of 1.6x compared to 1.4x in the pre-crisis  era.
