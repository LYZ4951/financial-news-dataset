HANOI, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed up 1.13 percent on Tuesday, extending its winning streak to 13 sessions, boosted by foreign funds buying blue chips, analysts said.

Shares in Baoviet Holdings <BVH.HM>, Vietnam's biggest insurer, climbed 6.79 percent to reach its seven-month high of 47,200 dong ($2.24) each. Real estate firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> rose 4.61 percent and Petrovietnam Drilling and Well Service <PVD.HM> increased 6.47 percent. Although some investors took profit in the morning session, the strong buying demand from foreign funds boosted the index on Tuesday, said analyst Nguyen Hoai Nam at Maybank Kim Eng Securities. "Because of the unstable political situation in Thailand, some foreign funds are shifting their investment to Vietnam," Nam added. Foreign investors were net buyers of 22 million shares last week, the highest weekly level since the first week of February 2013, the exchange's data showed.
