Jan 21 (Reuters) - Financial stocks have been the strongest performers so far in this fourth quarter U.S. earnings season.

Bank of America <BAC.N> led the way, with an 867 percent increase in earnings per share over its $0.03 profit a year ago. The fourth-quarter earnings season is now about 10 percent complete, and a trend is developing where companies are missing their earnings estimates, while beating revenue estimates. So far, only 49 percent of companies have exceeded analyst earnings estimates, while 64 percent have posted positive revenue surprises. This is a clear reversal from the recent pattern, where earnings beat rates have been higher than revenue beat rates for the past nine quarters.Read more: http://alphanow.thomsonreuters.com/2014/01/earnings-roundup-financials-sector-leads-slow-start-earnings-season/#.Ut71AtK6ZAt   Keywords: ALPHANOW/EARNINGS FINANCIALS
