Jan 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Signs that UK car insurance premiums may be bottoming  out after two years of falls are positive for the sector, but intense  competition means a rebound in prices is unlikely in the near term, Fitch  Ratings says. This means underwriting losses are unlikely to shrink in 2014,  while continued low returns mean investment income may not be enough to  compensate. The average cost of quoted comprehensive car insurance has fallen by around 24%  over the last two years, but the fall slowed significantly in 4Q13, according to  data from Towers Watson and Confused.com. We believe the drop in premiums since  2011 has been partly driven by expectations that claim costs will start to  reduce due to regulatory reforms on personal injury claims, and insurers  choosing to cut costs before seeing evidence of a decline because of the  competition in the sector. We expect the reforms to reduce the frequency of lower-cost personal injury  claims such as whiplash, and to reduce costs related to claims-management  companies. It remains unclear how much claims costs will be reduced by the  changes, but we believe some insurers may have overestimated the likely benefit.  The decline in costs for those companies will therefore not match the fall in  premiums. Increasing prices to counterbalance the overshoot will prove difficult due to  ample underwriting capacity, which has fostered competition. We therefore  believe that companies will increase focus on cutting expenses to limit  underwriting losses. The UK personal motor sector produced an accident year  combined ratio of 107% in 2012, which reduces to 104% if reserve releases from  prior underwriting years are factored in.
