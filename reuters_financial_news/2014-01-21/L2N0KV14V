PANAMA CITY, Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Panama Canal Authority said on Tuesday it was discussing a new financing proposal with the Spanish-led consortium expanding the waterway and insurer Zurich aimed at ensuring work continues on the project, which faces huge cost overruns.

Canal Administrator Jorge Quijano said the consortium, which is led by Spanish builder Sacyr <SCYR.MC>, had told him it would not stop work on the project before at least the end of January.
