ISTANBUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank shied away from hiking interest rates on Tuesday despite rising inflation and a falling lira, in a bid to support economic growth ahead of elections this year.

The bank kept its main policy rate, the one-week repo rate, at 4.50 percent, its borrowing rate at 3.50 percent and its overnight lending rate at 7.75 percent, it said in a statement after its monthly monetary policy committee meeting. It also left the primary dealers' overnight borrowing rate from the central bank unchanged at 6.75 percent.
