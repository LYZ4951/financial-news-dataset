MILAN, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Italian insurance group Unipol <UNPI.MI> said on Tuesday it had agreed to proceed with exclusive talks with Germany's Allianz <AVLG.DE> to sell assets carrying premiums worth around 1.2 billion euros ($1.63 billion).

In a statement, Unipol and its main operating unit UnipolSai <US.MI>, said the agreement would be formally completed by March 15. The assets belong to Unipol's Milano Assicurazioni unit. Unipol agreed to buy its troubled rival Fondiaria-SAI in 2012 in a complex rescue deal that created Italy's second-biggest insurer.
