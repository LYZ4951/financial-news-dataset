NYIREGYHAZA, Hungary, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The ECB's latest steps to push money into the euro zone economy alone would not justify a rate cut in Hungary but could help offset other negative market risks such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the chief economist of the National Bank of Hungary said on Friday.

Daniel Palotai also told Reuters that loose monetary conditions in Hungary could remain until the end of 2015 based on current knowledge. The central bank said in July that it ended its easing cycle and rates could remain at 2.1 percent in a lasting way.
