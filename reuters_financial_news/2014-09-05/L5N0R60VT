SOCHI, Russia, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble is trading at a comfortable level inside its trading corridor, Central Bank First Deputy Governor Ksenia Yudayeva said on Friday.

The Russian central bank keeps the rouble in a trading range against a dollar-euro basket and intervenes when the rouble reaches either edge of the band. The band is currently set at 35.40-44.40 roubles per basket. "The rouble is trading now at a comfortable level inside its trading corridor," Yudayeva told a banking conference in Russia's southern city of Sochi. At 0735 GMT, the rouble was trading at 41.79 versus the dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX>, 0.3 percent higher since Thursday's close.
