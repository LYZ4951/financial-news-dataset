WARSAW, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Europe's second-biggest insurer AXA <AXAF.PA> has offered between 500 million and 600 million zlotys ($154.2-$185 mln) for the insurance arm of Poland's mBank <MBK.WA>, daily Puls Biznesu reported on Friday.

The report cited sources as saying AXA is in the running for the unit along with Italian insurer Generali <GASI.MI> and Switzerland's Zurich Insurance <ZURN.VX>. None of the companies  were immediately available for comment. AXA, which already has a presence in Poland, wants to chip away at local market leader state-run insurer PZU <PZU.WA>, the newspaper's sources said.
