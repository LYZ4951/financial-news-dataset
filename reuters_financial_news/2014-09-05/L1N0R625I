NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Argentina still has "unresolved" issues preventing a settlement with bondholders suing the country for repayment after not participating in the country's restructurings following its 2002 default, a court-appointed mediator said Friday.

Daniel Pollack, a New York lawyer appointed by U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan to oversee settlement talks, in a statement said he met Thursday with lawyers for Argentina and the bondholders. "The issues that divide the parties remain unresolved," he said, adding he would continue in his role at the judge's request.
