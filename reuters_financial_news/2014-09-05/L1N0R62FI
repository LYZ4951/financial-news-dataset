SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Former United Commercial Bank executive Thomas Yu has agreed to plead guilty in a U.S. criminal case resulting from bank's 2009 failure, according to a court filing on Friday.

Yu was charged with securities fraud and other criminal counts. The joint court filing on Friday from U.S. prosecutors and Yu's attorney did not specify which charges he would admit.
