COPENHAGEN, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Danske Bank's <DANSKE.CO> pension fund unit Danica Pension will cut funds invested through the group's asset management unit Danske Capital due to its plan to increase direct investments in unlisted companies, a spokesman of the fund said.

Spokesman Mikkel Bro Petersen told Reuters the fund believes that best results of investing in unlisted companies would be reached by managing them by itself, and not by outside asset managers. "Our new investment strategy implies that some of the tasks earlier with Danske Capital will in the future be handled by Danica, because we assess it will give the best results for our customers," he said on Friday. He would not say how much of Danica's total assets of 344 billion Danish crowns ($60 billion) are currently managed by Danske Capital. He also declined to say how much funds the unit is planning to transfer. Danica, Denmark's second-largest commercial pension fund, made its first direct investment into companies in June this year, when it invested 400 million crowns in Danish shipper Unifeeder.
