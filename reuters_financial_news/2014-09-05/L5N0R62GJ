STOCKHOLM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Sweden's leading opposition party said on Friday it was not proposing to ease a mortgage cap if it wins elections in September, but that the issue would need to be taken into account when eyeing possible amortisation requirements.

Magdalena Andersson, the Social Democrats economic policy spokeswoman and who is seen as the likely next finance minister has been criticized by both the current government's finance minister and by the bank industry for suggesting a relaxation of an 85 percent cap of the purchase price on how much households can borrow. Andersson denied she had made such a proposal. She said that the mortgage cap needed to be considered in conjunction with compulsory repayment of mortgage principal - another measure on the table to curb excessive lending -  "since they are measures with the same purpose, so that one hand knows what the other is doing". That did not necessarily mean relaxing the mortgage cap. "What I am saying is that you should discuss it in the same context," she told Reuters. "We have not said we are ready to ease it." In a Reuters interview in August she said about the cap that "it is there and we are not proposing to take it away", although she also said the Social Democrats would "definitely not" like to make it tougher. Sweden is struggling with one of Europe's highest levels of household debt, at over 170 percent of disposable income and seen rising. On Thursday, when the central bank left its key interest rate at a record low of 0.25 percent it said risks related to indebtedness required further measures aimed directly at household demand for credit. "The responsibility for this lies with the government and other public authorities," the central bank said in the rate decision statement. The Social Democratic-led centre-left opposition is holding a steady lead ahead of the Sept. 14 election. The latest opinion poll, published earlier on Friday, showed the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left parties at a combined 48.5 percent versus 36.9 percent total support for the four parties in the incumbent centre-right government.
