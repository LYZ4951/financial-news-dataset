ATHENS, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of Greece <BOGr.AT>, the country's central bank, has picked economist Yannis Mourmouras for the post of deputy governor for a six-year term, an official at the bank told Reuters on Friday.

"The general council decided to propose Yannis Mourmouras as the new deputy governor," the official said, declining to be named, ahead of an official announcement expected later Friday. Mourmouras, 49, is an economics professor at Macedonia University and served as deputy finance minister in the interim government of Lucas Papademos in 2011. He has also advised Prime Minister Antonis Samaras on economic matters. Mourmouras will replace Eleni Dendrinou-Louri, whose term expired in June.
