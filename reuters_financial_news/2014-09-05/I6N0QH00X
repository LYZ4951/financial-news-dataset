CERNOBBIO, Italy, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI> is sticking to its plans to exit Telecom Italia <TLIT.MI> without any rush, the chairman of the bank's management board said on Friday.

"Our plan says that we will shed all our non-banking shareholdings while trying to protect the value of our stakes," said Gian Maria Gros-Pietro on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti forum in Cernobbio.   Intesa Sanpaolo is a member of the Telco vehicle that currently controls the Italian telecoms company. The Italian partners in Telco - who also include Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> and Generali <GASI.MI> - have recently signaled a desire to exit the unprofitable seven-year investment to focus on their core banking or insurance businesses. Spain's Telefonica <TEF.MC> is also a shareholder of Telco.
