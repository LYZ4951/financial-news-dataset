NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Cantor Fitzgerald Wealth Partners, launched in late 2013 by institutional trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald <CNTOR.UL>, said Friday it hired Bank of America <BAC.N> unit Merrill Lynch's head of recruiting for the Pacific Northwest market to lead its internal recruiting efforts.

Jack D. Mounts' title at Cantor Fitzgerald is managing director and head of recruiting. He resigned in August from Merrill Lynch, where he most recently served as executive recruiter for the Pacific Northwest.  A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman confirmed that Mounts had left the company but declined to comment further. Joining Mounts at Cantor Fitzgerald is Michael Lonk, who Cantor announced on Friday will serve as vice president and senior recruiter.
