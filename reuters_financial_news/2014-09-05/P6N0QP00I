PARIS, Sept 5 (Reuters) - European stocks dipped early on Friday, pausing after the previous day's sharp rally spurred by an interest rate cut from the European Central Bank which also launched new measures to support the euro zone economy.

At 0706 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,399.68 points, retreating from a 6-1/2 year high hit in the previous session.
