MANILA, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The Philippine central bank will consider the uptick in annual core inflation in August, which rose to 3.4 percent from 3.0 percent in July, in reviewing policy settings at next week's meeting, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Amando Tetangco said on Friday.

Headline inflation in August was steady at 4.9 percent, the statistics agency said, but core inflation climbed to its highest in at least six months.
