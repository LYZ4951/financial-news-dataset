NEW YORK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Alliance HealthCare Services Inc <AIQ.O>, a provider of diagnostics imaging and radiation oncology services, is exploring a potential sale of the company, according to people familiar with the matter.

Newport Beach, California-based Alliance, which has a market capitalization of just over $300 million, has tapped investment bank Moelis & Co <MC.N> to assist with that effort, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.

Private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management LP <OAK.N> owns a 44 percent stake.
