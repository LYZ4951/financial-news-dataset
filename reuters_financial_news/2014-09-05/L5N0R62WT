LAGOS, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Nigeria's interbank lending rates eased to 10.5 percent on Friday, down 25 basis points from a week earlier, after the central bank paid off matured treasury bills and refunded an excess it owed to banks from a cash reserve debit, dealers said.

The central bank paid out 186 billion naira ($1.15 billion) to buy maturing Open Market Operation bills on Thursday, while it credited banks with 70 billion naira more than it owed them to enforce a cash reserve limit. "The market is very liquid," one dealer said.  Lenders have been unable to access their cash balance with the regulator for more than two months due to a system glitch. The open buy-back rate eased to 10.5 percent, from 10.75 percent last week, 1.5 basis points below central bank's benchmark interest rate of 12 percent.
