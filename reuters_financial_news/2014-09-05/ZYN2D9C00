FRANKFURT, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Banks will return 9.111 billion euros in long-term loans to the European Central Bank next week after it launched another plan to boost the economy on top of a four-year loan programme due to start later this month.

The amount that banks will repay on Sept. 10 is more than this week's crisis-loan repayments of 3.509 billion euros and surpasses the 2.5 billion euros forecast in a Reuters poll. [ECB/REFI] The ECB cut interest rates to new record lows on Thursday - the deposit rate deeper below zero - and launched a new plan to boost lending to euro zone companies. It also pledged to do more if needed to fight off the risk of Japanese-style deflation. The measures include the four-year loan scheme and a plan to buy securitised loans, which the ECB hopes will encourage banks to boost their lending. [ID:nL6N0PE5K0] Banks continue to repay LTRO funds they took from the ECB in late 2011 and early 2012 as they are going through ECB health checks, which are in their final stages now with a Europe-wide bank stress test. On Friday, the ECB said five banks would repay 203 million euros from the first LTRO on Sept. 10 and seven banks would pay back 8.9 billion from the second LTRO.
