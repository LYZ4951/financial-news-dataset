MUMBAI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a second consecutive session on Friday as profit-taking continued in blue-chip stocks such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> after record highs hit earlier in the week, while foreign investor sales in equity derivatives also weighed.

ICICI Bank provisionally fell 1.6 percent while Housing Development Finance Corp <HDFC.NS> ended 2.1 percent lower.
