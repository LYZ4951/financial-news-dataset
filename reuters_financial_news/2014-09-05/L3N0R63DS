BANGKOK, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Philippine stocks hit a 15-month high on Friday, posting their best weekly gain in five months on selective buying in financial shares, while the Thai index rose to near a psychological mark of 1,600, helped by some buying in construction and bank shares.

It rose 3 percent on the week, the biggest gain since the week ended April 4, and was the best performer in Southeast Asia. Actively-traded stocks included shares of Bank of the Philippine Islands <BPI.PS> and Metropolitan Bank & Trust <MBT.PS>. Investors looked forward to possible interest rate hikes at  the Philippine central bank's meeting next week after data early on Friday showed an acceleration in August inflation.[ID:nL3N0R612J] The Thai SET index <.SETI> edged up 0.3 percent, rebounding from a modest fall on Thursday and closing at 1,584.32, a level last hit on May 29, 2013. It extended its gains for a fifth straight week, adding 1.5 percent. Shares seen as reaping the benefits of local economic recovery led the gainers, including cement maker TPI Polene <TPIPL.BK>, which jumped 6.2 percent and Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK>, which climbed 1.3 percent. All the bourses in the region ended the week higher, with Indonesia <.JKSE> up 1.6 percent while Singapore <.FTSTI>, Malaysia <.KLSE> and Vietnam <.VNI> rose modestly.
