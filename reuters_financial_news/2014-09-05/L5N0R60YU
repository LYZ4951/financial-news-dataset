ISTANBUL, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Turkish assets slipped on Friday, reversing gains driven by unexpected euro zone easing, as the focus turned to U.S. jobs figures which could help prompt monetary tightening in the world's biggest economy.

Turkey is especially sensitive to changes in global liquidity conditions because of its large current account deficit, which is financed with foreign capital inflows. Istanbul's main share index <.XU100> was down 0.23 percent at 82,039 points by 0737 GMT, outpacing the 0.4 percent fall in the broader emerging markets index <.MSCIEF>. The benchmark 10-year government bond yield <tTR200324T0=IS> rose to 9.09 percent from 9.04 on Thursday and the lira weakened to 2.1668 against the dollar from 2.1555. Shares, bonds and the lira gained on Thursday after the European Central Bank (ECB) defied the consensus and cut its benchmark interest rate to a record 0.05 percent.  But across the Atlantic, data provided fresh evidence that the U.S. economy was on track for sturdy growth in the third quarter. Companies hired workers at a steady clip in August and service sector activity accelerated to 6-1/2-year high.
