HONG KONG, Sept 5 (Reuters) - China shares rose for a sixth straight day, with port stocks leading Friday's gains thanks to Chinese government's plans to support the shipping industry.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> climbed 0.9 percent to 2,326.43 points, the highest close since May 2013. It gained 4.9 percent on the week, making this the best one since February 2013.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings closed up 0.95 percent, taking gains for the week to 4.7 percent, the best week in almost a year.  Ningbo Port <601018.SS> surged the maximum allowed 10 percent and Tianjin Port Holdings <600717.SS> rose 2.8 percent after China published a set of guidelines to support and develop its shipping industry.
