SAO PAULO, July 3 (Reuters) - Activity in Brazil's services sector rose to a six-month high in June, a survey showed on Thursday, as fans arriving for the World Cup brought more business to hotels and restaurants.

HSBC's Purchasing Managers Index for Brazilian services <BRPMIS=ECI> rose on a seasonally adjusted basis to 51.4 in June from 50.6 in May. A reading above 50 shows growth. As a result, HSBC's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> for the country, incorporating a sharp drop in manufacturing activity, edged up to 49.9 in June from 49.8 in May. It was the third consecutive month that the index showed a contraction. The month-long soccer World Cup, which kicked off June 12, has long been a focal point for Brazil's tourism and hospitality industries. Service providers are hoping it will provide a broader boost to lift Brazil's economy from a three-year slump."What called our attention was that the Business Expectations Index recovered practically all the loss of the last two months, jumping from 52.2 to 73.3," said Andre Loes, chief economist for HSBC in Brazil.
