STOCKHOLM, July 3 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate to 0.25 percent on Thursday, more than forecast, as it eased monetary policy for the first time in seven months, saying the Swedish economy continued to strengthen but inflation remained lower than expected.

The Riksbank also lowered its average forecasts for interest rates "substantially," saying it now does not foresee any increases in the rate until the end of 2015. All analysts polled by Reuters had said the bank would lower the key repo rate to 0.50 percent from 0.75 percent. Four of the participants forecast one more rate cut this year; the rest expected rates to be left unchanged.
