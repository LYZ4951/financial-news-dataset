WASHINGTON, July 3 (Reuters) - American Eagle is recalling its Big Sword fireworks devices on the eve of the Fourth of July holiday because they can unexpectedly explode, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Thursday.

The Lansing, Michigan, company, which does business under the name Big Fireworks, is pulling about 1,040 of the fireworks, the commission said in a statement. The blue-and-yellow device is a 30-inch (76-cm) handheld fountain that looks like a sword. It is designed to emit sparks from the sword's tip, it said. American Eagle has gotten two reports of explosions while in use. No injuries have been reported.
