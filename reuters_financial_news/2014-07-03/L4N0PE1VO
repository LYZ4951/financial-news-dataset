BANGKOK, July 3 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares snapped three sessions of gains on Thursday amid profit-taking and a weaker rupiah <IDR=ID> ahead of the presidential election next week, while Philippine stocks rose for the second day to a 13-month high amid inflows into banking shares.

Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> fell 0.4 percent after hitting its highest level in more than two weeks on Wednesday. Banking shares, which led the recent rally, fell on foreign-led selling. Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK>, the most actively traded stock, dropped 2 percent, erasing gains made over the past three days. Indonesia posted foreign outflows worth a net 207 billion rupiah ($17.37 million), its first in four days, Thomson Reuters data showed, as the rupiah <IDR=ID> led losses among emerging Asian currencies. [ID:nL4N0PE1M0] The Philippine main index <.PSI> closed at a 13-month high of 6,899.31, as banks such as BDO Unibank <BDO.PS> and Bank of the Philippine Islands <BPI.PS> rose amid foreign buying, stock exchange data showed. Banks also led gainers on Thailand's key SET index <.SETI>. The banking subindex <.SETB> was up 0.6 percent, extending Wednesday's gains. The two-day rally made the sector overbought with the 14-day relative strength index ending at 73.38, with a level over 70 considered overbought. Stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> were little changed, in line with Asian stock markets  <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, while Vietnam <.VNI> closed near a three-month high. [ID:nL4N0PE202]
