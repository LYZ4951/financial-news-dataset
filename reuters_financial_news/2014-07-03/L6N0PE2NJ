DUBAI, July 3 (Reuters) - Bahrain's Arab Banking Corp <ABCB.BH> chose four banks to arrange a $500 million loan of three years duration, a statement from the lender said on Thursday, with funds to be used for general business purposes.

The facility, to be arranged by HSBC <HSBA.L>, National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, Natixis <CNAT.PA> and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp <8316.T>, will pay an interest rate of 120 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
