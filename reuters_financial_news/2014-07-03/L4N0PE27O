SEOUL, July 3 (Reuters) - South Korean and Chinese leaders agreed on Thursday the two countries should work to conclude negotiations for a free trade deal by the end of the year at a summit meeting in Seoul, a joint statement said.

The two leaders also agreed they are firmly opposed to nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, in an apparent reference to North Korea's pursuit of atomic weapons.
