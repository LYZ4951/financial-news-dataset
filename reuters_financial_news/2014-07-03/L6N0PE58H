BERLIN, July 3 (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Jens Weidmann expressed concern on Thursday that low interest rates are easing pressure on euro zone governments to shape up their economies, and said the ECB should not leave policy loose for too long.

Speaking hours after ECB President Mario Draghi delivered a dovish message at his monthly news conferece, Weidmann said that - over time - ultra-loose monetary policy leads to financial stability risks such as excessive gains on real estate markets. "It is all the more important now to make clear that the Eurosystem will not delay a necessary normalisation of monetary policy out of regard for state finances," Weidmann said in the text of a speech for delivery at a conference hosted by Germany's conservatives in Berlin. "With regard to the euro zone, I therefore say: monetary policy has made its contribution to delivering price stability." Earlier, the ECB left interest rates steady a month after cutting them to record lows and pushing its deposit rate into negative territory for the first time - effectively charging banks for holding their money to prompt them to lend more.  Weidmann said it would take a while before the effects of the policy measures announced in June are felt in full, and added that it was wrong to speculate already about the ECB taking further action. The tone of Weidmann's comments was very different to the more dovish message delivered by Draghi just hours earlier after the monthly meeting of the ECB's policymaking Governing Council in Frankfurt. [ID:nL6N0PD3JN] Draghi told his monthly news conference the Council was united in its willingness to launch into quantitative easing - essentially creating money to buy government or private debt from banks to keep borrowing costs low and boost spending - if inflation headed lower still. Weidmann also expressed concern about reduced risk premia on sovereign bonds in "crisis countries", with Spain and Italy enjoying particularly favourable borrowing conditions. Loose monetary policy was one reason for this, he said, along with the pricing in of future reforms.
