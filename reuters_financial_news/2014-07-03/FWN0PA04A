LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - British infrastructure group Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> said trading at its mechanical and electrical engineering division had worsened, resulting in a 35 million pound ($60 million)profit shortfall.

The company said on Thursday that the shortfall would be broadly offset by targeted public-private partnership disposals in the second half of the year.
