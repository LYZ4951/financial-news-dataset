SOFIA, July 3 (Reuters) - Bulgarian Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski said on Thursday he would likely stand down between July 23 and 25, in line with an agreement between political parties to hold a snap election on Oct. 5.

Oresharski told BTV television he had good reason to wait until after July 21, when Bulgaria's troubled Corpbank <6C9.BB> is due to reopen after it was placed under central bank control following a run on deposits last month.
