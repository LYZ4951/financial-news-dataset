BEIJING, July 3 (Reuters) - Growth in China's services sector edged down from a six-month high in June, with the purchasing manufacturing index (PMI) for the industry slipping to 55, government data showed on Thursday.

That compares with a reading of 55.5 in May, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. A reading above 50 in PMI surveys indicates growth on a monthly basis, while an outcome below the threshold points to a contraction in activity.
