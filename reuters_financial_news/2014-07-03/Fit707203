July 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Accor SA's <ACCP.PA> (Accor;  BBB-/Stable) deeply subordinated EUR900m fixed-to-reset rate (DS) notes a final  'BB' rating. Fitch has applied 50% equity credit treatment to this issue. The  terms of the final documentation are in line with the information already  reviewed when assigning the expected ratings to this instrument. In addition Fitch assigned Accor SA's CHF150m senior unsecured 1.75% 2022 bond a  'BBB-' rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS FOR THE DS BOND Subordinated Ranking The hybrid issue is deeply subordinated and ranks senior only to Accor's share  capital, while coupon payments can be deferred at the discretion of the issuer.  As a result the 'BB' rating is two notches below Accor's 'BBB-' Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR), reflecting the notes' higher loss severity and risk of  non-performance relative to senior obligations. This approach is in accordance  with the agency's criteria, "Treatment and Notching of Hybrid in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis" dated 23 December 2013.   50% Equity Treatment The DS bonds qualify for 50% equity credit as they meet Fitch's criteria with  regard to subordination, remaining effective maturity of more than five years,  full discretion to defer coupons for at least five years and limited events of  default. Deferrals of coupon payments are cumulative and there are no look-back  provisions.  Perpetual Issue The DS bonds are perpetual notes with no legal maturity date. The bonds are  callable on the first call date, and subsequently five years after that date and  then on any interest payment date thereafter. Under Fitch's criteria, the  effective maturity date is the point in time when replacement intention falls  away. The agency will remove the equity credit of the notes for its rating  forecasts five years before what Fitch deems as the effective maturity date is  reached (ie equity credit will fall away for the above in 2035).   KEY RATING DRIVERS FOR THE CHF BOND Senior Unsecured Ranking The CHF senior unsecured bond ranks pari passu with all other senior unsecured  debt. The bond benefits from a negative pledge clause as well as other covenants  including cross default with other debt. Proceeds from the bond will be for  general corporate uses. KEY RATING DRIVERS Size and Diversification Accor's ratings continue to reflect the group's positioning in the economy and  mid-scale segments, strong brand awareness, scale and geographical  diversification as a leading hotel group in the world and number one in Europe  in terms of hotel rooms.   New Property Strategy Under its new strategy announced in November 2013, Accor has set a  value-oriented disciplined hotel ownership strategy, which includes an end to  expansion through leases and no further disposals of hotels, unless they are  structurally underperforming assets. This should assist in reducing the group's  lease-adjusted debt burden in the next three to four years.   Stable Leverage Funds from operations (FFO) lease-adjusted gross leverage fell to 4.7x at  end-2013 from 5.0x at end-2012, due to reduced lease liabilities. This was  broadly in line with Fitch's estimates. We expect a small rise in FFO  lease-adjusted gross leverage in 2014 to around 4.9x, due to a combination of  various new funding transactions, including the hybrid and the 2021 EUR750m bond  in January 2014, partly offset by a reduction in capitalised lease obligations.   New Business Model The new business model splits the group into two distinct entities with their  own targets. The HotelInvest division owns and leases 1,400 hotels and is  yield-oriented. Accor's HotelServices division is the hotel operator and brand  franchisor within the group and is fee-oriented. Its development strategy is  based on management and franchise contracts. From a rating perspective, this new  hotel "twin track" strategy should ensure that Accor generates additional free  cash flow (FCF) in the medium term, as it moves more towards a fee-based  structure and reduces expensive variable-lease payments.  Low FCF Accor's FCF remains limited as the group continues to own a material proportion  of its properties. In addition the group is expanding rapidly, mainly in Asia  Pacific and Europe, and is spending around 9%-10% of its revenues in capex. The  ratings reflect our expectation of mildly positive FCF margin over the next  two  years.   Still High Lease Liabilities While Accor's new property policy includes a firm commitment to not sign any new  leases, Accor still has significant rental liabilities totalling over EUR845m at  FYE13. However, Accor is reviewing all its leases and particularly its variable  leases, which are likely to be restructured and reduced over the next three to  four years. Consequently, both lease adjusted leverage and fixed charge cover  should slightly improve in the next three years, giving some additional  financial flexibility.   Manageable Shareholder Pressure We believe that shareholder pressure from investors such as PE house Colony  Capital will continue. Accor has a publicly stated policy of a dividend pay-out  ratio of 50%, but it does not rule out greater cash returns as long as this  remains in line with Accor's investment-grade rating objective. Further material  cash returns to shareholders and sustained negative FCF could put negative  pressure on the ratings.   Adequate Liquidity At FYE13 Accor had EUR1,500m of undrawn committed facilities and EUR1,800m of  unrestricted cash (out of a total of EUR2bn). This is comfortable liquidity as  Accor only has EUR490m of bond and bank debt maturities until end-2016 and  little working capital requirement volatility. On 16 June 2014 Accor announced  the signing of its new EUR1.8bn five year syndicated facility, which will  further improve its liquidity and debt maturity profile.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that could lead, both individually or  collectively, to a positive rating action include: - Group EBIT margin above 15% (FYE13: 9.7%) - Fitch FFO lease adjusted gross leverage below 4.0x and lease-adjusted net debt  /EBITDAR ratio below 3x on a sustained basis - Lease-adjusted EBITDAR/gross interest plus rents ratio of above 2.5x (FYE13:  1.8x)  Sustainable positive FCF (excluding exceptional costs)  Negative: Future developments that could lead, both individually or  collectively, to a negative rating action include: - Group EBIT margin below 8% - Fitch FFO lease adjusted gross leverage above 5.0x and lease adjusted net  debt/ EBITDAR ratio above 4.0x on a sustained basis
