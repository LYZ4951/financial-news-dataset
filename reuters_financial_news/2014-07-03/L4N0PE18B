HANOI, July 3 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.62 percent at the break on Thursday, with investors expecting good corporate results from securities firms and tyres makers, an analyst said.

Shares in Saigon Securities Incorp <SSI.HM> rose 1.12 percent by midday, on track for their third straight gain, after easing from the highest intra-day level since April 28 hit in early trade. Tyre makers, such as Danang Rubber Co <DRC.HM> and the Southern Rubber Industry Co <CSM.HM>, benefited from lower natural rubber price, said deputy manager Nguyen Thanh Lam of Maybank Kim Eng Securities. Technical indicators showed the index could continue rising over the next three weeks to be on par with the year-high of 609.46 points hit on March 25, Lam added.
