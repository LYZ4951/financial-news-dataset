SYDNEY, July 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to extend gains on Friday after Wall Street notched up more records on stronger than expected U.S. jobs data, driving the Dow over 17,000 for the first time.

The mood was buoyant in global markets with a key volatility measure, the VIX index <.VIX>, falling to 10.32 - its lowest since 28 February 2007, suggesting further upside for riskier assets on the day.* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> jumped 27 points or 0.5 percent to 5,480, an 11.2-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> close. The benchmark gained 35 points or 0.66 percent on Thursday to close at 5,491.2. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> fell 4.87 points to 5,162.5 in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended with multiple records at close on Thursday, with the Dow topping 17,000 for the first time on a much stronger-than-expected June jobs report. * The U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs in June, racing past the 212,000 that economists had expected. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent, the lowest since September 2008, confirming expectations that the economy bounced back in the second quarter after a dismal start to the year.
