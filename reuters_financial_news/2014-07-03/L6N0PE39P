LAGOS, July 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria's FBN Insurance on Thursday said it will launch a bid next week to buy out the 28.8 percent minority stake in Oasis Insurance <OASISIN.LG> that it does not already own, in a deal valued at 1.03 billion naira ($6.34 mln).

FBN Insurance, jointly owned by Nigeria's FBN Holdings <FBNH.LG> and South Africa's Sanlam <SLMJ.J>, acquired a 71.2 percent stake in the motor and fire insurer in February.  It will offer 0.55 naira per share to buy the remaining 1.87 billion shares, it said.
