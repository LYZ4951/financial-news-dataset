SYDNEY/WELLINGTON July 3 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose broadly to scale a 3-week peak on Thursday, steered by more signs of economic momentum in the United States, yet another record high on Wall Street and gains for metals prices.

After a soft month in June, institutional investors were also busy picking up bargains as a batch of data stoked renewed optimism about the health of the global economy. "Investors do all the portfolio rebalancing in June to close up the financial year and the money they have left on the sidelines of the whole process, they generally put it into the market at lower levels," said Stan Shamu, market analyst at IG.  On Wednesday, the Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record highs, after figures from payrolls processor ADP added to a string of bullish U.S. data. The ADP data raised hopes the government's payrolls report due later Thursday would confirm a strong rebound in the U.S. economy after a first-quarter slump.

The 'Big Four' banks continued their run higher as investors chased their high yields, with Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX> adding 1 percent and Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> climbing 0.5 percent.
