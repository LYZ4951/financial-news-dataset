PARIS, July 3 (Reuters) - European stocks were steady in early trading on Thursday, halting a two-session rally, as investors awaited the U.S. payrolls figures before chasing stocks higher.

At 0703 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.03 percent at 1,384.67 points. According to a Reuters poll of economists, payrolls probably increased 212,000 in June, marking the fifth consecutive month of job gains above 200,000, which would cement views that economic growth has rebounded.
