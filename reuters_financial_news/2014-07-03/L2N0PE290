NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - Investors in U.S.-based funds committed $3.1 billion to stock funds in the week ended July 2 after adding $1.5 billion to the funds the prior week, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.

The new cash came entirely from stock exchange-traded funds, which saw net inflows of $4.8 billion. In contrast, stock mutual funds posted net outflows of $1.7 billion, the first such outflows since December.  Stock mutual funds are commonly purchased by retail investors, while stock ETFs are thought to represent the institutional investor.
