HONG KONG, July 3 (Reuters) - China shares lingered at two-week highs on Thursday, as early losses were erased after a private survey reinforced signs that the broader economy is stabilising.

Activity in China's services sector expanded at its fastest pace in 15 months in June, according to a services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit. [ID:nL4N0PD1K1] The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC>, rising for the fourth day in a row, ended up 0.2 percent at 2,063.23 points.  The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings added 0.4 percent, its fifth gain in six sessions. Anhui Conch Cement <600585.SS>, the biggest cement producer, climbed 4.7 percent after saying late on Wednesday it expected H1 net profit up to rise about 90 percent from a year earlier on increased sales and prices.
