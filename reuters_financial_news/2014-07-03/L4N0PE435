July 3 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on the Puerto Rico Government Investment Trust Fund (PRGITF) to A-mf from Aaa-mf, citing higher risk of large and unorderly redemptions from the fund due to the commonwealth's fiscal challenges.

PRGITF is a collective investment trust sponsored by the Government Development Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico, which recently passed a law allowing some of its public corporations to restructure their debt, has $70 billion in tax-free debt outstanding.
