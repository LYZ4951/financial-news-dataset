July 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Italy-based  Finmeccanica SpA's <SIFI.MI> (FM) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB+' and  Short-term IDR at 'B'. The agency has also affirmed Finmeccanica Finance SA's [SIFIF.UL] and Meccanica Holding Inc's senior unsecured ratings at 'BB+'. The Outlook on  the Long-term IDR is Negative.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook reflects the risk that FM's restructuring measures may take  longer than expected in yielding an improvement in the company's FFO and FCF  generation, while debt and leverage are high for the ratings.  It also reflects  that deleveraging may take longer to achieve than envisaged.  Fitch expects to  review the ratings again by the end of 2014 with a view to assessing whether  progress on margin improvement and deleveraging potential is adequate to  maintain the 'BB+' ratings.  Fitch is assuming that the company's FFO margin will improve gradually over the  course of 2014. A return to profitability levels expected of a 'BB+' company in  this sector is key to maintaining the present ratings. While Fitch expects FCF  to be negative in 2014 due to a weak defence outlook, high capex and an only  gradually improving operational profile, sustained positive FCF generation in  the years after is also key to maintaining the ratings.  Financial Performance Recent operating performance has been fairly poor, with the funds from  operations (FFO) margin falling to 5.5% for the last 12 months (LTM) to 31 March  2014, (from 6.1% in 2013) as weakness in the US defence and transportation  segments more than offset improvements in helicopters and aeronautics. LTM FCF  was materially worse than expected, at negative EUR403m, as a result of a large  working capital outflow stemming from a cancellation of a helicopter order as  well as slightly higher-than- expected capex.   High Leverage  Finmeccanica had gross leverage of 4.4x at end-2013, above the downgrade  guideline of 4x. As debt reduction is integral to maintaining the present  ratings, Fitch expects this ratio to trend towards 4x in the medium term, absent  any accelerated debt repayment from asset disposals. A sustained improvement in  leverage to under 4x, either from the cash proceeds from asset sales or FCF  generation would significantly enhance the prospects of changing the outlook to  Stable.  Slow Deleveraging From Asset Disposals To date, the sale of Ansaldo Energia (FM received EUR277m cash and  deconsolidated EUR183m debt), and of FM's 15% stake in aero engine parts maker,  AVIO SpA [BCVINO.UL] (worth EUR260m), have been announced, yielding the company around  EUR800m, some of which will be received after 2014. The company may complete the  sale of other identified assets such as in the transportation segment; however,  the slower-than- expected process of disposals to date means that deleveraging  is not materialising as quickly as previously expected.   New CEO In May 2014 Mauro Moretti took over as CEO from Alessandro Pansa, making Mr  Moretti the fourth CEO within the past three years. While Fitch acknowledges the  focus Mr Moretti's strategic review brings to improvements in the cash  generation capacity of Finmeccanica, it is too early to determine the effect of  the latest appointment, and possible changes to the overall strategy of the  company mean that restructuring efforts may not yield the desired effect.Corporate Governance  The company has made significant efforts to bring corporate governance in line  with international peers. This is illustrated in the appointment of the new  Chairman, Giovanni De Gennaro, former national police chief. We believe it is  too early to ascertain the effectiveness of these measures, and corporate  governance will continue to be a rating driver.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:  - FFO based lease adjusted gross leverage at above 4x on a sustained basis - FFO margin below 7% - Consistently  negative FCF - Further material cash restructuring charges - New material adverse findings or actions in relation to the corruption and  bribery investigations into FM taking place  Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  - Successful disposals of non-core assets, with consequent debt reduction of  approximately EUR800m - FFO adjusted leverage sustainably below 2.5x (at least two years, with at  least one being historical) - FFO margin sustainably above 9% (at least two years, with at least one being  historical) - FCF/revenue consistently above 2%
