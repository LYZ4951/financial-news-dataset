BELGRADE, July 3 (Reuters) - The Serbian dinar fell on Thursday to its lowest against the euro since June 11 in low trading volumes.

The Serbian currency <EURRSD=D1> weakened to 116.05 around noon (1000 GMT), from an average of 115.8 a day earlier.  "Some foreign traders purchased euros, and market liquidity is low, so even comparatively small transactions can move it," said a dealer with a Belgrade-based commercial bank.  He could not say whether the Serbian central bank, which maintains the dinar in a managed float, might intervene to stabilise the currency.
