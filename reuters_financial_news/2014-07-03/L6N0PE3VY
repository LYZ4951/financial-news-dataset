DUBAI, July 3 (Reuters) - Samba Financial Group <1090.SE>, Saudi Arabia's third-largest listed bank by assets, has proposed paying a cash dividend of 0.65 riyals ($0.17) per share for the first half of 2014, it said in a bourse filing on Thursday.

The proposed figure is marginally higher than the 0.6 riyals per share which the bank paid in the corresponding period of 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data.
