CAIRO, July 3 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> was steady at a central bank dollar sale but strengthened on the black market on Thursday.

The central bank said it sold $37.4 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, the same as its last sale on Wednesday. The bank's rates have stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after it allowed the pound to weaken in May. It offered $40 million on Thursday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.33 pounds, stronger than Wednesday's price of 7.38 pounds.
