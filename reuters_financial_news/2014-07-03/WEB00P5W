ZURICH, July 3 (Reuters) - Swiss Re <SRENH.VX> played down competition from alternative capital in the reinsurance industry on Thursday, and said it was on track to meet its 2011-2015 financial targets.

"With clients expected to continue to rely on reinsurers for services and long-term support, we also believe that alternative capital cannot replace the traditional reinsurance model," the reinsurer's chief executive Michel Lies said in a statement released ahead of an investor day in London.
