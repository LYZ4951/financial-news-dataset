MADRID, July 3 (Reuters) - Trading in shares of Spanish wireless network provider Gowex <GOW.MC> was suspended on Thursday pending a statement from the company, said the press office of the Mercado Alternativo Bursatil (MAB) on which the firm is listed.

Gowex on Wednesday said its accounts were accurate and it would soon hire new auditors after its shares dropped about 60 percent in two days on a report from Gotham City Research LLC questioning the company's revenue reporting and the competence of its managers. [ID:nL6N0PD537]
