NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended July 2 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $0.9 billion to $1.054 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $38.8 billion to $1.049 trillion.
