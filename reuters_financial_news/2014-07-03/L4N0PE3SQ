July 3 (Reuters) - Tobacco majors Lorillard Inc <LO.N> and Reynolds American Inc <RAI.N> are likely to merge as early as end of July, CNBC reported, citing sources.

Reuters, in May, exclusively reported that Reynolds American was in active discussions to buy Lorillard in a complicated, three-way transaction that could see British American Tobacco PLC <BATS.L> take a major role to back a potential merger. [nL2N0OS25C] Lorillard share rose as much as 6.2 percent, while those of Reynolds American were up nearly 3 percent. Imperial Tobacco Group Plc <IMT.L> was evaluating a deal for assets likely to be divested from Reynolds American and Lorillard if the two U.S. tobacco companies proceed with a proposed combination, Reuters reported last month.
