TOKYO, July 3 (Reuters) - Japan's Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co Ltd <8750.T> will issue up to 275.9 billion yen ($2.7 billion) in new shares to help fund its planned acquisition of U.S. peer Protective Life <PL.N>, according to a regulatory filing with the finance ministry.

The issuance plan was widely expected after Dai-ichi Life last month filed a shelf registration to issue new shares.
