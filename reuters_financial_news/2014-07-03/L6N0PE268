ROME, July 3 (Reuters) - Italy's Finmeccanica <SIFI.MI> will seek "firm" offers for its unprofitable train-making unit Ansaldo Breda by the end of July and will present a new business plan by the end of the year, its chief executive Mauro Moretti said on Thursday.

"There is a data room open and a lot of companies are taking part in it," Moretti told reporters on the margins of a conference. The state-controlled aerospace and defence group put Anslado Breda and other assets up for sale more than 2 years ago to cut its heavy debt burden but political meddling and a corruption scandal delayed the process.
