STOCKHOLM, July 3 (Reuters) - Measures going beyond interest rate moves to help boost flagging inflation back toward target were not on the cards at present, Swedish Central Bank Governor Stefan Ingves said after the Riksbank cut its key repo rate to just above zero on Thursday.

"This is not currently on the agenda, but in this business one has to be prepared for everything," Ingves told reporters following a news conference.
