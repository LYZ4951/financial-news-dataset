JERUSALEM, July 3 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel aims to further diversify its foreign currency portfolio to boost investment returns and will for the first time shift up to one percent, or about $865 million, of its reserves into U.S. corporate bonds.

The pilot will begin this year, said Andrew Abir, director of the bank's market operations, and the idea is to get the infrastructure in place with a mix of external managers for portfolios and competence in-house to manage corporate bonds. The idea of a pilot was first floated in a March report, but few specifics were mentioned. Israel's foreign exchange reserves have surged in recent years with the central bank buying large amounts of dollars to keep the shekel from growing too strong. Current reserves are $86.5 billion, up from $32.9 billion in 2008. As reserves grew, Abir said, the bank could think about slightly less liquid assets and getting a better return profile. Corporate bonds were initially considered a few years ago after a new law was passed that allowed the bank to explore ways to diversify its portfolio, which at the time consisted of various government bonds. "When we first looked at riskier assets, we also looked at corporate bonds. But we picked equities because there was a negative or low correlation between equities and sovereign fixed income. And equities were cheaper, whereas corporate bonds were more expensive," Abir told Reuters. Yields on U.S. corporate bonds are at historically low levels, while major stock indexes are hovering near record highs. Corporate bonds that the central bank would consider buying will have to be rated at BBB- or higher, he said. "A move to a significant investment in corporate bonds will be dependent on market conditions. At the moment, valuations are not very compelling," Abir said. Like other central banks, the Bank of Israel is looking to broaden its exposure to stocks. "Now, 8 percent of the reserves are invested in equity and the Monetary Policy Committee has approved a maximum possible allocation of 12 percent, but further investments will depend on market conditions," he said. "My guess is (central banks investing in equities) will become far more common, especially for countries whose reserves have grown markedly." Most of the Bank of Israel's activity has been in the United States, but a small amount has been shifted into Germany, Britain and France. The move has so far paid off. The financial daily Calcalist reported that in the first five months of 2014 the Bank of Israel on paper made $380 million from these investments.
