STOCKHOLM, July 3 (Reuters) - A new bank tax that Sweden's Social Democrats want to introduce if they win a general vote in September could be as high as 8 billion crowns ($1.2 billion) annually, a party spokeswoman was quoted as saying on Thursday.

"That would be if we introduced the entire package, and we haven't yet taken a stance on that," business daily Dagens Industri quoted economic spokeswoman Magdalena Andersson as saying in an interview.  On Tuesday she told a news conference the party wanted to raise taxes for banks by 4 billion crowns to finance reforms. [ID:nL6N0PC3W3]
