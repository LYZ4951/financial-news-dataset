SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL] said on Friday it has acquired an 18.5 percent stake in Brazilian education services company Abril Educacao SA <ABRE11.SA>.

GIC did not say how much it paid for the stake in Abril, a leading player in Brazil's primary and secondary education market. Based on Abril's latest closing share price, the stake is worth about $265 million. Funds managed by Brazilian buyout firm Tarpon Investimentos <SA TRPN3.SA> in June also took a significant stake in Abril.  GIC has recently stepped up investments in Latin America,  recently buying a stake in Brazilian online sports goods retailer Netshoes. It also opened an office in Brazil earlier this year.
