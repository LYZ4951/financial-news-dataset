LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - British construction firm Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> has reaffirmed its rejection of a merger proposal from rival Carillion <CLLN.L>, it said on Friday.

Balfour Beatty said it had further considered Thursday's announcement from Carillion. "The proposal remains unchanged to that rejected on Aug. 11 2014. The board reaffirms its rejection of the proposal," Balfour said. Balfour has rejected two proposals by Carillion to create a 3 billion pounds ($5.0 billion) group better placed to compete for major international contracts against the likes of Spain's Ferrovial <FER.MC>.
