LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays <BARC.L> is set to be fined by the UK financial regulator over failures to segregate client assets properly, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

Bloomberg, citing two people with knowledge of the matter, said the potential fine from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was still under discussion. The fine could surpass 60 million pounds ($100 million) and come later this year, one of the people said. Barclays and the FCA declined to comment.
