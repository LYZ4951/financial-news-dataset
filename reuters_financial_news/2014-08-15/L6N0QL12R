FRANKFURT, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Shares in German chemicals group SKW Stahl-Metallurgie <SK1Gn.DE> fell by more than half on Friday after the group issued a profit warning and said it would probably not meet certain financial covenants.

SKW forecast business to be worse than previously expected, requiring 84 million euros in impairments of assets in Bhutan and Sweden. Non-tangible and deferred tax assets were also impaired, the company said in a statement issued late on Thursday. The group said that first-half earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and net profit will be "significantly negative".
