SOFIA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's central bank is to allow some banking activities to resume at Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB> so borrowers can repay loans to the country's fourth-largest lender.

"(Borrowers) are allowed payment transactions for the purpose of repayment of loans to the bank," the central bank said in a statement on Friday.
