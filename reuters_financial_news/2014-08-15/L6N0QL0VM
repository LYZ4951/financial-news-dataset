OSLO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Two of Norway's richest men raised their stakes in Norwegian Property ASA <NPRO.OL>, sending the real estate developer's share price sharply higher in expectation of a possible takeover battle.

Investment firm Famaday Trading, controlled by shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, has doubled its stake in the past few weeks to 20 percent, while Canica ASA, controlled by Stein Erik Hagen, lifted its stake to 13 percent from 10 percent, the companies said in separate statements on Friday. Norwegian Property, which developed the upmarket Aker Brygge quarter on Oslo's waterfront, has been in great demand as Norway's real estate market rebounds from a slump and lending rates remain at historically low levels.  Shares in the developer, up 37 percent since the start of the year, rose as much as 10 percent on Friday to a 16-month high, valuing the company at $885 million. Fredriksen started buying into the company in July and bought his initial stake through a brokerage before raising it further through Famaday, though his connection with the investment firm was not known at the time. His name did not surface until financial daily Finansavisen reported on Friday that he was behind Famaday, just as it announced that it had bought a further 5 percent and could buy more.  Fredriksen could not be reached for immediate comment but sources close to the companies involved said that the newspaper report was accurate. Hagen's Canica, the biggest shareholder before Fredriksen's investment, responded by buying more shares.   Hagen, the chairman of conglomerate Orkla <ORK.OL>, is worth $5.4 billion, according to Forbes magazine, while Frediksen, who owns a vast empire from drilling firm Seadrill <SDRL.OL> to fish farmer Marine Harvest <MHG.OL>, is worth $14.8 billion.
