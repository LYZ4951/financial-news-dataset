HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Malaysia's securities regulator rejected a $317 million initial public offering of Matrix Capacity Petroleum, IFR reported on Friday, citing a source familiar with the deal.

The deal would be the biggest in the country for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), also known as blank check IPOs because companies raise money through the stock market without a single asset on their books.  Matrix Capacity planned to launch the IPO in the second half of 2014 and use the funds to buy oil and gas assets, added IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. Malaysia's Securities Commission didn't immediately return a request for comment on the decision, IFR said. The 1 billion ringgit ($317 million) would surpass the previous record set by Reach Energy Bhd <RESE.KL>, which raised 750 million ringgit and started trading on Friday.
