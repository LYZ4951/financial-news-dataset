MEDELLIN, Colombia, Aug 14 (Reuters) - There is no reason for Colombia's central bank to interrupt its trend toward striking a neutral stance in monetary policy, a member of its policy-setting board told Reuters on Thursday, endorsing a series of interest rate increases since April.

The seven member board failed to agree unanimously for the first time on the latest of those rate increases in July, with some board members favoring a pause due to risks to growth posed by lower oil revenues and a larger current account deficit. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an industrial conference in the city of Medellin, board member Carlos Gustavo Cano said he favored "normalizing" monetary policy without stating explicity whether he backed further rate rises. "At the moment there is no reason, I can't see one, to modify this trend towards a neutral stance in monetary policy," said Cano, without suggesting what interest rate level might correspond to a neutral monetary policy, meaning one that would be benign for both inflation and growth. The central bank has made four consecutive quarter-percentage point increases to the benchmark lending rate since April, taking the lending rate to 4.25 percent in an effort to head off inflation risks as economic growth accelerates. The central bank's board will hold its next monthly rate-setting meeting on August 29. Inflation has been comfortably within the central bank's 2-4 percent target range and the bank expects it to be around 3 percent for the year. The central bank has also raised its 2014 growth forecast to 5 percent in July, up from 4.3 percent previously. Cano said Colombia's economy was performing well in contrast with other countries in the region and had a controlled level of inflation and falling unemployment. "These are circumstances that allow, with all clarity, to begin to seek, as we have begun to since April in the board of the Bank of the Republic, the normalization of monetary policy. That's very different from saying that what is being sought is to slow down the economy," he said. "It's about normalizing the stance, so that these favorable circumstances from a macroeconomic point of view can carry on for longer," Cano said.
