Aug 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has hired Patricia McClung as assistant director of mortgage markets, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an official with knowledge of the matter.

McClung, who spent 23 years at mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac, joins CFPB from the Federal Housing Administration, where she was a senior adviser for the past year.
