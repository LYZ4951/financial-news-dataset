NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Women's shoe retailer Stuart Weitzman is preparing to launch a sale process and has tapped investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> and Citigroup Inc <C.N> to assist with the effort, people familiar with the matter said.

The New York-based retailer could fetch a price below $1 billion, two of the people said this week. Other people said the ultimate sale price could be around $800 million.  Sycamore Partners, the New York-based private equity owner of Stuart Weitzman, acquired the brand as part of its $2.2 billion purchase of Jones Group Inc earlier this year. The people asked not to be named because the plans are not public. Representatives for Sycamore Partners, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
