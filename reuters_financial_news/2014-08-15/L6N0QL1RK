BUDAPEST, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Hungarian lender OTP Bank <OTPB.BU> expects a turnaround in most of its markets by next year after multiple setbacks pushed it to a record loss in the second quarter, its deputy chief executive told Reuters.

The loss of 153.2 billion forints ($655 million) came as OTP set aside nearly 200 billion forints for losses at its core Hungarian bank and its Ukrainian subsidiary. [ID:nL6N0QK5QT]  Laszlo Bencsik said the bank would put the main causes of the losses behind it, including difficulties in Russia and Ukraine and a Hungarian law calling for massive refunds to loan clients.  Bar the occasional upset, emerging Europe's largest independent lender has produced steady profits over the past decade and throughout the global financial crisis, but its bottom line became more volatile in recent quarters. Asked whether he expected to have a hard time to restore OTP's consistent profitability, Bencsik said: "No. If you take out the one-off items, then the bank has produced fairly steady results in the past few years. What affects the group negatively is the situation in Russia and in Ukraine."  "In Russia we expect that the toughest period is behind us," he added. "In the first quarter of next year or if all goes well in the fourth quarter already, we can return to profits there." "In Ukraine, the significant change will be less immediate, but in the medium term, meaning perhaps next year, a positive turn is possible."  OTP's Ukraine losses in the quarter were half from goodwill writedowns and the rest from loan loss provisions.  Bencsik said the presence of the IMF and the EU as lenders in Ukraine could pave the way for a more modern market economy and a European-style institutional system. "The regions that suffer from the conflict are only a small part of Ukraine," he said.   SEES CALM IN HUNGARY Bencsik expected no further one-off items on the bank's core Hungarian market, which will take a big hit in coming months as the centre-right government forces compensation for borrowers over what it sees as past overpayment.  Hungary's Parliament in July required banks to refund customers for earlier contract modifications that it saw as unfair and over exchange rates that had been used to calculate foreign-currency loan payments. [ID:nL6N0PF3PS] OTP set aside 176 billion forints in the quarter to cover related losses. That, said Bencsik, should draw a line under the issue: "We do not expect further one-off items in the next period".  Hungary's government also plans to force a conversion of the current massive stock of foreign currency-denominated loans into forints by next year. Bencsik said if that plan is executed he still expected no extra charge from it.  "A conversion would reduce the risk associated with the banking system and the economy and rid us of a real problem," he said, adding that the country's top court had declared foreign currency loans were not illegal as such.  "Because clients bore the risk of currency swings legally, I can hardly imagine that (a conversion) would have a negative impact for banks."  He said faster than expected second-quarter GDP growth in Hungary, at 3.9 percent, signalled an opportunity for banks. Demand for OTP's mortgage products was growing at more than 30 percent, he said, and if that could be sustained or accelerated the bank could offset repayments on older loan stock by the end of next year.
