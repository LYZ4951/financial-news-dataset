Sept 24 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank has allocated 3 billion euros of its reserves to supply commercial banks with foreign currency as they compensate clients for undue past cost and interest rate rises, the central bank said in a statement on Wednesday. [ID:nB3N0OF00Q]

Following are the main details of the programme, which runs from Oct. 13 until at least the end of March, 2015.  * The programme aims at satisfying banks' foreign currency demand necessary for the settlement and planned conversion of household foreign currency loans so that foreign currency demand will not put pressure on the forint's exchange rate. * The supply of foreign currency will be covered from the MNB's foreign exchange reserves. A basic principle of the programme is that the reserve adequacy of the central bank must be continuously maintained. * The programme consists of two facilities: a spot euro sale transaction conditional on reducing short-term external debt, and a longer-term foreign currency swap transaction combined with spot euro sale. * In the case of the conditional instrument, banks must reduce their short-term external debt by as much as 50 percent of the foreign currency received. * Also in the case of the conditional instrument, foreign exchange reserves will decrease in the short run, whereas through the repayment of short-term external debt the MNB's need for foreign exchange reserves will also decrease. * A longer-term unconditional instrument will be a combination of a spot euro sale transaction and a long foreign currency swap (CIRS). This will primarily provide a risk covering opportunity for banks that cannot reduce their short-term external debt. * Under the unconditional euro sale facility, banks can only have access to foreign currency liquidity at maturities longer than one year. * The MNB has allocated a total amount of 3 billion euros to cover forint conversion by banks, of which a maximum 1 billion euros will be offered for unconditional transactions and 2 billion euros will be set aside for spot euro sales conditional on the reduction of short-term external debt.
