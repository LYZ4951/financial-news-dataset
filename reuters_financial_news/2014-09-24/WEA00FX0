FRANKFURT, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Rocket Internet, the German e-commerce investor that plans to go public, could seek separate listings for some companies in its portfolio but this would remain an exception, its chief executive said on Wednesday.

"It's possible that some of our bigger companies may be listed over time," CEO Oliver Samwer said at a press conference. After Rocket's IPO, divesting the companies that it helped to set up would no longer be part of the group's business model. "We will only sell non-core assets," Samwer added.
