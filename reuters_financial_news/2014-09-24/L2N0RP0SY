NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd has had contact with Actavis Plc <ACT.N> about a potential sale to the larger drugmaker, as it continues discussions with Allergan Inc <AGN.N> about selling itself, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Allergan has revived discussions to buy Salix in recent weeks after on-and-off talks for nearly a year, as it tries to fend off a hostile offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc <VRX.TO>, Reuters reported earlier this week. [ID:nL2N0RN2BH] CNBC reported earlier Wednesday that Salix was in early-stage discussions with Actavis.
