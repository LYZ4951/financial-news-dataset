Providing support was a renewed pledge by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to keep monetary policy loose for an extended period to push inflation in the euro zone closer to the targeted two percent level. [ID:nL6N0RP0NM] "Futures are up, it may have been reacting more to the rise in Europe - Draghi came out and said he is going to do whatever is necessary" regarding Quantitative Easing, said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
