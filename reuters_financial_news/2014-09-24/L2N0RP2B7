NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Cyber-Ark Software Ltd <CYBR.O> was the Nasdaq's biggest gainer on Wednesday, with the stock soaring on massive volume in its trading debut.

The stock opened at $25, well above its initial public offering price of $16, and added to those gains in afternoon trading. It last traded up 67 percent at $26.86, on volume of 16.43 million shares, making the Israel-based cybersecurity software company one of the Nasdaq's most active names. Cyber-Ark's strong debut follows Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's <BABA.N> from last week. That IPO ranks as the world's biggest, and shares rose 38 percent in their trading debut on Friday.
