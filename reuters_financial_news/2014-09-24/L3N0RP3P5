MUMBAI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Top Indian lender State Bank of India <SBI.NS> said on Wednesday its board had approved a 10-for-one stock split.

SBI will reduce the face value of each equity share to 1 rupee from 10 rupees now, it said in a regulatory filing. State-run Punjab National Bank <PNBK.NS> and top private sector lender ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> this month approved stock splits. Companies typically split shares to make those attractive for retail investors.
