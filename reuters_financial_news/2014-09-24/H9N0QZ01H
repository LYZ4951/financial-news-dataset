HONG KONG, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Chinese brokerages jumped in afternoon trade on Wednesday, on belief they would benefit from policy changes and from the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock trading link that is expected to begin in October.

At 0549 GMT, CITIC Securities <600030.SS> climbed 2.3 percent, Haitong Securities <600837.SS> rose 3.5 percent, Changjiang Securities <000783.SZ> surged the maximum allowed 10 percent and Guoyuan Securities <000728.SZ> soared 5.7 percent.  Anticipated policy stimulus was the main driver of the rises.  China's securities regulator urged the country's brokerages to raise fresh capital at least once over the next three years via initial public offerings or private share placements, the official Securities Times reported on Tuesday.
