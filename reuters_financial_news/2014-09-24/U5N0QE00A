CHEYENNE, Wyo., Sept 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should begin raising rates soon and should do so in a "gradual and systematic" way, a top Fed official said on Tuesday.

Saying she is "most anxious" to begin the normalization process, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she believes the economy is now able to withstand higher rates and that leaving rates low for too long will further stoke risk-taking in financial markets.  The public should expect financial markets to be "volatile" during the Fed's liftoff from near-zero interest rates, she warned.  George, who does not have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, has consistently called for tighter monetary policy even as the Fed expanded its stimulus over the last few years.
