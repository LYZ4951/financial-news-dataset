DUBLIN, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Property prices in Dublin rose by 25.1 percent year-on-year in August, data showed on Thursday, as a lack of supply drove price rises nationally to their highest level since the 2006 peak of a property boom.

Prices in Dublin were 3.5 percent higher compared with the previous month, while across the country they rose 2.3 percent month-on-month and 14.9 percent on the year, the Central Statistics Office said.
