Sept 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Citizens Financial Group Inc <CFG.N>, the U.S. unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc <RBS.L>, rose less than 1 percent in their debut, valuing the company at about $12 billion in the biggest U.S. offering by a bank since the financial crisis.

The offering, which raised $3.01 billion for RBS, is the second biggest in the United States this year after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's <BABA.N> $25 billion IPO last week. Citizens Financial's IPO was priced at $21.50, below the expected range of $23-$25. RBS owned 100 percent of Citizens Financial before the offering.
