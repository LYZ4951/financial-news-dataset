NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Short interest on the Nasdaq rose 2.1 percent in the first half of September, the exchange said on Wednesday.  As of Sept. 15, short interest rose to about 8.754 billion shares, compared with 8.576 billion shares as of Aug. 29.  Investors who sell securities 'short' borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.  Shorting can also be part of a hedging strategy.  (U.S. markets team) ((+1-646-223-6344))  Keywords: MARKETS SHORTINTEREST/NASDAQ
