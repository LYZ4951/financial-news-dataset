HONG KONG, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Shanghai shares finished at their highest in more than 1-1/2 years on Wednesday, helped by brokerage firms which rose amid optimism over policy reforms.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> climbed 1.5 percent to 2,343.6 points, its best close since March 6, 2013. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings rose 1.8 percent to a two-week closing high.  Wednesday was the best day for both indexes since Aug. 4. Among top CSI300 contributors, CITIC Securities <600030.SS> leapt 3.5 percent, Haitong Securities <600837.SS> put on 3.3 percent, and Changjiang Securities <000783.SZ> surged the maximum allowed 10 percent. Banking and energy stocks staged a comeback as investors regained some confidence after a preliminary private survey on China's manufacturing sector for September came in better than expected on Tuesday.
