PARIS, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Baudouin Prot, Chairman of BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> since 2011, is to leave the French bank and the board is due to meet on Friday to choose a successor, two sources close to the situation said on Wednesday.

One of the sources said Jean Lemierre, an adviser to the bank since 2008 who was a key negotiator with U.S. authorities over its $8.9 billion fine this year for sanctions busting, is a potential successor. "It was a personal decision," said a second source of Prot's move, confirming recent press reports. "After more than 30 years with the bank, he wants to take a step back." Prot's mandate as chairman was renewed earlier this year and had been due to run until 2017. He joined the bank in 1983.
