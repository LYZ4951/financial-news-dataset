DUBAI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ [MTFGTU.UL] (BTMU), Japan's largest lender, will issue Islamic bonds in two tranches under its debut multi-currency sukuk wakala programme in Malaysia, a statement on the Malaysian central bank's website said on Wednesday.

BTMU will issue $25 million in a U.S. dollar tranche and 2.5 billion yen ($22.9 million) in a yen tranche on Thursday, the statement said. Both sukuk issues will have maturities of one year; the statement did not give other details such as pricing. Malaysia's CIMB Investment Bank is managing the issues. BTMU, part of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T>, set up a $500 million multi-currency sukuk programme through its Malaysian unit in June, aiming to become the first Japanese commercial bank to tap the sukuk market.
