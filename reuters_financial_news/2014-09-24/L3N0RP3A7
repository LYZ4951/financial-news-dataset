MUMBAI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell for a second straight day as resources firms such as Jindal Steel and Power, and public sector lenders that lent to them, slumped after the country's top court cancelled most coal blocks allocated since 1993.

India's top court ruled on Wednesday that companies will have until end of March next year to return most of the coal blocks allocated by the government since 1993 even after they have spent billions of dollars on projects around them.

However, losses were trimmed as consumer-related stocks gained as investors preferred to derisk portfolio.  "It's a sensitive industry and ramifications (of the Supreme Court's decision) will be quite big. They (the government) have to take a final stand and have to move quickly," said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research and chief strategist at SMC Global Securities Ltd. "The market is in a consolidation mode. Now, the good companies will stand different and quality of companies will play a role."
