NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered Argentina to show why it should not be held in contempt for violating orders favoring creditors who refused to accept restructured bonds following the country's 2002 default on $100 billion.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan federal court scheduled a hearing for Friday at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) at the request of the holdout bondholders, who have asked the judge to find it violated his orders.
