NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - SunEdison Inc <SUNE.N> shares rose on Wednesday and options activity surged on rumors that U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co <GE.N> was interested in the solar company, but they gave up most of their earlier gains after GE denied they were in talks.

Shares in SunEdison at one point were up more than 11 percent to $21.39, rising on speculation of GE interest in the company, Caitlin Duffy, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers said.  However, GE spokesperson David Lurie denied the rumor, saying the company is not in talks with SunEdison. Tory Carroll, a spokeswoman for SunEdison at public relations firm Grayling, said SunEdison did not have a comment. The origin of the rumors was unclear.  SunEdison shares gave back some of their gains and were more recently up 4.4 percent to $20.14.  There was substantial activity in the options market. Calls betting on a 20 percent gain in SunEdison shares by Oct. 18 were the most popular and traded 10,334 times on Wednesday.  October calls at the $19 strike were bought shortly after the opening bell for $1.10 and $1.12 before the chatter started making the rounds, said Fred Ruffy, options strategist at Whatstrading.com. Those calls rose to trade as high as $2.50, according to Thomson Reuters data and were last at $1.75 each. Options volume on SunEdison was five times normal, with 91,000 calls and 9,598 puts traded, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.
