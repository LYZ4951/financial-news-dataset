NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Demand for protection against a U.S. stock-market selloff soared on Friday as traders scooped up call options in CBOE Volatility index VIX <.VIX>, Wall Street's favorite index of anxiety.

January call options - contracts betting on the rise of the underlying security - on the VIX this week rose to a record 8.4 million contracts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange <CBOE.O> while the index itself jumped nearly 30 percent on Friday and 43.5 percent for the week.  Since the VIX usually moves inversely to the performance of the S&P 500 stock index <.SPX>, traders often use the index to hedge against a market decline.  Reflecting the surge in demand for short-term protection, the spread between the VIX and three-month VIX futures briefly turned negative on Friday. Generally, due to the mean-reverting nature of the VIX, when the VIX is low, VIX futures trade at a premium. "We haven't had a correction for a while now, and while I think the market is overreacting a bit, concerns about China and other emerging market equities and currencies are weighing," said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "Looking at the implied volatility of VIX calls versus VIX puts, it's relatively cheaper to buy VIX calls now so it's a good time to buy (VIX calls) if you think it's headed higher." Wall Street was closing out its worst week since November 2012, weighed by concerns about growth in China that fed a broad selloff across the globe, but particularly in emerging markets. The S&P 500 is down 2.2 percent so far this week. While the VIX is at its highest level since October, it is still way below its 20-year average of 20.50. Along with the spike in VIX, VIX-related exchange-traded products also jumped including the iPath S&P 500 VIX short-term futures exchange-traded note VXX <VXX.P> and ProShares UltraPro Short Russell2000 exchange-traded fund UVXY <UVXY.P>, up 8.9 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively. The iPath VIX ETN tracks activity in near-term futures contracts and is a way to bet on volatility without actually buying options. With more than 47 million shares traded Friday, it was the third-most active exchange-traded product on U.S. exchanges.   STILL A LONG WAY TO GO Earlier this week, a trader was reported to have paid 90 cents for 90,000 May expiration call options at the 23 strike on the VIX index. Considering that the index was below 13 at that time, the trader was betting the VIX to roughly double by May. On Friday, premiums on the May call options were centered around $1.10 per contract. "While that's a decent gain from its purchase price, we can't help but feel as though traders are still assigning relatively low likelihood to a sustained rebound in volatility," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut. "Maybe that is because in the last year the VIX index has only traded above a 20 reading on about five occasions. And so while the market may be running scared again today, option traders are not yet willing to throw in the towel on the bull market," he said. Other notable trade on the VIX for the day was a 33,000-lot of Feb 19 calls for 59 cents, according to WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy. The most active options were the Feb 14 puts, Feb 22 calls, and Feb 16 calls.
