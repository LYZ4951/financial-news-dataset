PRAGUE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The Czech economy could grow around 2 percent in 2014 but this won't mean an end to central bank efforts to keep the crown from strengthening, said the country's outgoing prime minister who is tipped to join the bank's board.

Jiri Rusnok, who has led a caretaker cabinet since July and is expected to become a central bank policymaker in March, told Reuters in an interview that he supported the bank's November decision to weaken the crown currency to loosen monetary policy. The 53-year-old economist said growth may outpace his government's forecast of 1.3 percent, boosted by the bank's crown sales on the market to fight the risk of deflation and aid an economy recovering from a record-long recession. "(The interventions) can help the Czech economy return to a growth trajectory. This year's growth may bring a rather pleasant surprise. It can be around 2 percent," he said. Rusnok will hand over power to incoming Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka and his centre-left cabinet on Jan. 29. President Milos Zeman, who appointed Rusnok against the will of parliament after the collapse of a centre-right government in June last year, has already said he would name him to the seven-member central bank board when Eva Zamrazilova's term ends. Zeman has criticised the bank's move to intervene. The central bank has pledged to keep the exchange rate close to 27 crowns to the euro until it is certain the risk of undershooting its inflation target has decreased significantly. The bank sees the exit from the intervention regime "sometime in 2015 at the earliest." The crown traded at 27.52 per euro on Friday, down 0.2 percent on the day and 6.3 percent since the crown sales began.  "(An exit) certainly will not come this year," Rusnok said. "It is far ahead of us." Rusnok, who will replace a bank board member who had been cautious about launching interventions, said he did not yet have a concrete vision of what an exit from the scheme would look like.  He said, though, he was confident the bank would manage it well and that there would be no excessive strengthening when it ended. "I do not believe in any fast strengthening of the crown back to the level of 24 or something similar," he said. "I am quite certain that you won't even notice (the exit)."  EURO DEBATE The Czech economy is only just digging its way out of a recession after being hit by sluggish domestic demand, widely put down to the previous centre-right cabinet's austerity measures and the ripple effects of the euro zone crisis. Rusnok said external conditions were crucial for the economy. Rusnok will be Zeman's first appointment to the central bank. Zeman is set to make five appointments to the board during his term, which could make the bank more open to euro adoption in the coming years.  Former President Vaclav Klaus, a vocal eurosceptic, appointed the current board and the bank has been cool to adopting the euro, which the Czech Republic pledged to do eventually when it joined the European Union a decade ago. The decision to swap crowns for euros is up to the government, although the bank plays an advisory role. Rusnok said the public needs to get rid of "prejudices" against the euro zone, gathered in the past couple of years.
