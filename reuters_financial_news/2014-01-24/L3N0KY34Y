Jan 24 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1100 GMT on Friday:

** KKR & Co <KKR.N> and BlackRock Inc <BLK.N> are among the leading global investors in talks to buy a stake in China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd as the bad-debt manager seeks to raise more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. [ID:nL3N0KY28L]  ** Japanese utility Chubu Electric Power Co Inc <9502.T> and trading house Mitsui & Co Ltd <8031.T> are set to sign memorandums of understanding with Indian firms to cooperate in the energy sector, industry sources said. Chubu aims to sign an agreement with GAIL (India) Ltd <GAIL.NS>, while Mitsui plans to expand its existing partnership with India's Oil And Natural Gas Corp <ONGC.NS>. [ID:nL3N0KY2IS]  ** Jana Partners LLC has taken a large stake in Juniper Networks Inc <JNPR.N>, a move that comes at a time when one of the network gear maker's prominent investors is urging it  to increase shareholder returns. Hedge fund Jana did not disclose the quantum of its investment in Juniper, but said it is now one of the largest shareholders in the company, according to a letter to investors that was seen by Reuters. [ID:nL3N0KY1LD]  ** U.S. drugs distributor McKesson Corp <MCK.N> succeeded in its second attempt to win control of German peer Celesio AG <CLSGn.DE> in a deal with Celesio's two largest shareholders, German investment group Haniel and U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. McKesson, the largest U.S. drugs wholesale group, said late on Thursday that it now owned about 75 percent of Celesio's shares and would make a fresh offer for the remainder. The offer of 23.50 euros per share values Celesio at about 6.2 billion euros ($8.5 billion), including debt, it said.

[ID:nL2N0KX22D]  ** Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP <CG.O> said on Thursday it has agreed to acquire a strategic minority stake in privately held Vogue International, the maker of the Organix Hair Care product line. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but people familiar with the matter told Reuters a year ago that Vogue, which was marketing itself to potential buyers with the help of Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N>, could be valued at $800 million or more. [ID:nL2N0KX2HP] ** Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc <QCOM.O> acquired a patent portfolio from Hewlett-Packard Co <HPQ.N>, including those of Palm Inc and its iPaq smartphone, in a move that will bulk up HP's offerings to handset makers and other licensees.
