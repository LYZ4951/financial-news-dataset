BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's securities regulator said on Friday it deeply regrets a ruling by a U.S. judge that the Chinese units of the global "Big Four" accounting firms should be suspended from auditing U.S.-listed companies for six months.

At a regular news briefing, ministry spokesman Deng Ge said China hoped that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission "would make the correct decision" over the case, adding that "the SEC would bear all the responsibility for consequences of its action".
