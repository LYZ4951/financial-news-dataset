LAGOS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Nigerian interbank lending rates ended flat at an average of 10.3 percent on Friday, but dealers said they could start to edge higher ahead of an increase in banks' cash reserve requirement early next month.

Nigeria's central bank announced on Tuesday that it would raise the cash reserve requirement (CRR) on public sector deposits on Feb. 4 to 75 percent, from 50 percent, in a bid to support the naira currency and rein in inflation. [ID:nL5N0KV2J7] "We expect rates to remain stable for the better part of next week, but could inch up a little toward the end of the week in preparation for the debiting of cash reserves on Feb. 4," a dealer said. Overnight rates on Friday were unchanged from a week ago at 10.3 percent, slightly above the central bank's benchmark savings rate of 10 percent, despite excess liquidity in the banking system. Nigeria distributed about 581.5 billion naira to its three tiers of government last week with about a 298 billion naira ($1.86 billion) portion belonging to states and local government injected into the banking system. Overnight rates were still within the central bank's corridor of plus or minus 200 basis points around the benchmark interest rate of 12 percent for lending or saving with the regulator. Dealers said banks' credit balance with the central bank opened at 986 billion naira on Friday, slightly higher than 958 billion naira last week.
