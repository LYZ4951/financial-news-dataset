MOSCOW, Jan 24 (Reuters) - International settlement company Clearstream will open up settlement for Russian corporate bonds from Jan. 30, it said in a statement.

Earlier this week, Euroclear, the other major international settlement system, said that it would begin settling Russian corporate and municipal bonds from that day. [ID:nL5N0KW1IP] Both Euroclear and Clearstream have offered settlement services for OFZ Russian government bonds since February last year, as part of government-backed reforms aimed at liberalising Russian financial markets and boosting liquidity. Foreigners now hold around 25 percent in the $110 billion OFZ domestic government bond market, up from just 4 percent two years ago. The agreements with Euroclear and Clearstream mean that similar settlement procedures will be used for the $150 billion Russian corporate bond markets.
