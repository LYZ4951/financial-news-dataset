Jan 24 (Reuters) - Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp <OCBC.SI>, Singapore's second-biggest lender, is set to extend exclusive talks to acquire Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank Ltd <0302.HK> by as much as four weeks as it needs more time to secure regulatory approval, sources said on Friday.

A deal would represent OCBC's biggest acquisition to date, giving it a much sought after gateway to China and helping it  bridge the gap with bigger rival DBS Group Holdings <DBSM.SI>, which operates Hong Kong's fifth-biggest bank. The two banks had given themselves one month to reach an agreement and that deadline was set to expire on Jan. 31. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said that there had not been sufficient time to obtain regulatory approval due to the Lunar New Year holidays in Hong Kong. An OCBC spokeswoman in Singapore declined to comment. Officials for Wing Hang were not immediately available to comment. People familiar with the deal said this month that OCBC was offering nearly twice the Hong Kong lender's book value or around $5.3 billion, which has raised concerns about the likely need to tap shareholders for funds.
