SAO PAULO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Latin American stocks tumbled to their lowest level in 4-1/2 years on Friday as investors dumped shares of banks and commodities producers amid a global sell-off of emerging markets securities and currencies.

The MSCI Latin American stock index <.MILA00000PUS> fell 2.37 percent to 2,910.06, its lowest level since July 2009. Emerging markets stocks and currencies, and to a lesser extent bonds, have been pummeled in recent sessions as investors fret over issues including slower growth in China and a decline in U.S. monetary stimulus. [ID:nL2N0KY12H][ID:nL5N0KY16W]  Brazil's currency, the real <BRBY>, has also weakened sharply in recent days, partly due to a rapid currency devaluation in neighboring Argentina, which could sap trade. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index <.BVSP> dropped 1.62 percent to 47,535.88, a level it has not closed below in over five months. "The swing is a reflection of fear over investing in Brazil and the exit of capital, with investors leaving the country," said Fausto Gouveia, an economist with Brazil's Legan Asset. Shares of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA <PETR4.SA>, known as Petrobras, fell 2.3 percent, while Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA>, Brazil's largest non-government bank, dropped 1.6 percent. Brazil's Bovespa has fallen 20 percent in the past 12 months, compared with an 8.6 percent loss in Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> and a 22.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 <.SPX> over the same period.  Most investors have blamed the fall on broad concerns over economic fundamentals, erratic policy implementation and heavy-handed government meddling in the private sector. Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> sank its most in over two months, losing 1.58 percent to 40,876.87. Shares of lender Grupo Financiero Banorte <GFNORTEO.MX> fell 2.6 percent, while bottling firm Femsa <FMSAUBD.MX> lost 1.9 percent. Chile's IPSA index <.IPSA> posted its biggest one-day drop in over four months, falling 1.77 percent to 3,608.29 as only four out of 40 stocks in the index hung onto gains. Shares of retailed Falabella <FAL.SN> slid 2.6 percent, while rival Cencosud <CEN.SN> fell 3.9 percent. Miner and steel producer CAP <CAP.SN> rose 1.1 percent.
