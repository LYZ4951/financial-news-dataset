JAKARTA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Pharmaceutical firm PT Merck Sharp Dohme Pharma Tbk <SCPI.JK> shareholders have agreed to the company's plan to delist from the Indonesian stock exchange <.JKSE>, Merck Sharp told Reuters in an e-mail on Friday.

The Indonesian unit of U.S-based Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. <MRKXSH.UL> held an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday for the shareholders to approve the plan to delist due to low trading liquidity. The medicine maker plans via a tender to offer 100,000 rupiah per share to buy back a 10.8 percent stake from public shareholders in February.  Bahana Securities will handle the deal. "The company's shares are not actively traded and not liquid," Merck Sharp said. Merck Sharp's shares, which have only traded four times since October 2012, last changed hands at 29,000 rupiah, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Trading in the shares had been suspended since February 2013.
