WARSAW, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Poland's No.3 lender BZ WBK <BZW.WA> is expected to show a 60-percent rise in its net profit for the fourth quarter of 2013, mostly thanks to a one-off boost from revaluation of its insurance units stakes, a Reuters survey showed on Friday.

The Banco Santander <SAN.MC> unit is seen showing a bottom line of 644 million zlotys ($211 million), based on the average of estimates from seven banks and brokerages. Last month, the lender said it would see a 336-million zloty boost from the revaluation of its stakes in two local insurance units that it co-owns with British insurance group Aviva <AV.L>.
