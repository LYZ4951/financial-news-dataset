OSLO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Insurance payments after a major fire in the town of Laerdal in western Norway are estimated at up to 200 million crowns ($32.70 million), the federation for banks and insurance firms said on Friday.

Saturday's fire destroyed 17 listed wooden buildings, with another 40 buildings damaged by water and smoke. Some 60-70 people were made homeless. No one was killed. The estimate was preliminary and could change, Finance Norway said in a statement.
