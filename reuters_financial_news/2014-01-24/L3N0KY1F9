SEOUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - South Korean shares fell to their lowest closing level in two weeks on Friday, weighed down by lacklustre fourth-quarter corporate results.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.4 percent at 1,940.57 points, its weakest close since Jan. 10. The index slipped 0.2 percent on the week. Foreigners sold a net 154.2 billion won ($143.6 million) of KOSPI shares. Abundant capital inflows in programme trading cut losses before the market closed, as net buying of 127.1 billion won via non-arbitrage supported the main bourse. LG Household & Healthcare Ltd <051900.KS> and GS Engineering & Construction Corp <006360.KS> were the big names among a pile of weak performers, diving 12.8 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.
