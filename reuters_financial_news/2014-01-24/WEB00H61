STOCKHOLM, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Sweden is on track to raise on July 1 the amount of capital that banks have to put aside to cover the risk of losses from mortgage lending, financial markets minister Peter Norman told Reuters on Friday.

The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) wants to raise the risk-weight floor for mortgages to 25 percent from the current 15 percent, and has said that it wants to do so mid-year. Before raising risk weights the FSA needs a mandate from the government to be able to weigh in systemic risks when determining the floor.  Peter Norman didn't see any big obstacles to the time plan. "I don't see anything gumming up the works, so our estimate is definitely that it will happen on July 1."
