HONG KONG, Jan 24 (Reuters) - KKR & Co <KKR.N> and BlackRock Inc <BLK.N> are among the investors in talks to buy a stake in China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd as the bad debt manager seeks to raise more than $2 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Reuters previously reported that Huarong was planning to sell a stake of between 15-20 percent to strategic investors ahead of an eventual listing of China's biggest asset management company. [ID:nL3N0F017B] Other investors in talks to buy a pre-IPO stake in Huarong are private equity firms Blackstone Group <BX.N> and Bain Capital, the people said. Sovereign wealth funds from Asia and the Middle East are among the around 20 investors preparing to submit first-round offers by mid-February, they said. Blackstone, BlackRock and KKR declined to comment. Bain could not be reached for comment. A Huarong official said the company has been talking with investors, but they have not selected any. The sources declined to be identified as the process was private.
