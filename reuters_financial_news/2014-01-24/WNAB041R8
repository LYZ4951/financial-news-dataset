NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, will be paid $20 million for his work in 2013, restoring most of the $11.5 million cut directors imposed a year earlier following the company's embarrassing derivatives loss.

The sum includes a base salary of $1.5 million, plus $18.5 million of restricted stock, the company said in a public filing on Friday. Dimon was paid $11.5 million for 2012, half of his $23 million compensation in each of the prior two years, according to company filings.
