JOHANNESBURG, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The Nigerian central bank's decision this week to lift the cash reserve requirement on public sector deposits held by banks is expected to push up bond yields. In Kenya, muted demand is expected at a Treasury bill auction next week if money market liquidity remains tight.

NIGERIA Yields on Nigerian debt are seen inching up next week amid a tightening of liquidity by the central bank to curb speculation on the local currency. Nigeria hiked the cash reserve requirement (CRR) on public sector deposits to 75 percent from 50 percent on Tuesday to stabilise the naira [ID:nL5N0KV2FH]. "We see the market demanding higher yields next week as the central bank moves toward enforcing the new CRR debit on Feb. 4," a dealer with United Bank for Africa said. The yield on the July 2030 bond was up 10 percentage points at 13.40 percent on Friday, that on the August 2017 paper was unchanged at 11.94 percent, while the June 2019 issue was yielding 13.10 percent, down from 13.19 percent a week ago.  KENYA Kenyan Treasury bill yields are expected to fall marginally or hold steady at a sale next week as limited liquidity dampens demand. The Central Bank of Kenya will sell 91-, 182- and 364-day Treasury bills worth a total of 9 billion shillings ($104.90 million). At this week's sale, the weighted average yield on the 91-day bills <KE3MT=RR> was unchanged at 9.17 percent, while that on the 182-day bills <KE6MT=RR> was steady at 10.34 percent. The yield on the 364-day bills <KE1YT=RR> rose slightly to 10.69 percent from 10.67 percent at the previous sale. "The money market appears to be tightening but we expect liquidity to improve once government spending increases," Alexander Muiruri, fixed income analyst at African Alliance Kenya Investment Bank, said.  "As a result we expect auctions to continue being undersubscribed and the Treasury bill yields only dropping marginally by 10 basis points next week."  This week's Treasury bill auctions were undersubscribed, with investors opting to buy a 10-year bond whose sale was heavily oversubscribed. "Next week we may just see them well bid. But liquidity again will be the key factor to determine how investors will continue, because the government has some rollovers to do," said Peter Njuguna, head of fixed income at Kenya Commercial Bank.
