MOSCOW, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest food retailer, Magnit <MGNT.MM>, is expected to report a 21 percent increase in quarterly net income after it used its growing purchasing power to achieve lower prices from suppliers, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Friday.

Magnit has expanded its chain of low-price stores in Russia's regions while keeping a tight rein on costs, putting it ahead of competitors. It is due to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 results on Monday, Jan. 27.  The company is expected to report a net profit of $319 million, the average of estimates from 13 banks and brokerages showed, compared with $264 million a year ago. Underlying profitability is expected to have grown, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) seen at 11.8 percent of sales, up from 11.3 percent a year ago.  However, analysts are concerned by a recent slowdown in Magnit's revenue growth. The company said this month that sales growth slowed in December as customers chose to buy cheaper products, causing its shares to fall.

We think investors would be interested in hearing what Magnit management has to say about this," Uralsib said in a note.
