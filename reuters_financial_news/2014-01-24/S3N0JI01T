DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Friday he did not want to see the crown currency <EURSEK=> strengthen excessively though its current level, following appreciation since year-end, was not a major issue.

"I don't think the krona is a major issue today," Finance Minister Anders Borg said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Borg said that the level of the crown should be set by the market, but that the government should watch it closely. "I don't want to see it strengthening exessively," he said.
