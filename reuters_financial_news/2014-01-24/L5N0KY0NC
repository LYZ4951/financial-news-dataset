LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Davos day three offers another heavyweight line up.

European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, America's John Kerry, Britain's David Cameron and George Osborne and two other big name central bankers - Mark Carney and Harukiko Kuroda. Take your pick. Anything Kerry says about Syria will clearly make headlines as talks begin in earnest between Syrian government and opposition representatives in Geneva. Anything Draghi says is always newsworthy for financial markets, but my pick of the day is Bank of England governor Carney. With UK unemployment having tumbled almost to his policy trigger point in months, rather than the years he expected it to take, Carney is under pressure to alter the Bank's guidance in order to convince markets and British people and companies that interest rates won't rise soon. He had a stab at that last night, saying the Bank would take a "broader approach" to gauging when the economy is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs and signalled a new approach from next month. Is that the end of forward guidance or will the goalposts be shifted? Any further light he sheds today will be big for the markets. With elections due next year, Cameron and Osborne will be fervently hoping he pulls it off. Carney's colleague, Martin Weale, has just hit the screens saying rates can remain at record lows for some time yet and that a lowering of the unemployment threshold would quickly be overtaken by events. So what to do? Is it that time of week already? Yes, it's ratings day again. Fitch has affirmed Germany and Luxembourg at AAA with a stable outlook, no surprise there. S&P has affirmed Estonia at AA- and cut Croatia to BB, predicting a sixth straight year for recession. Only a dramatic revival of the euro zone debt crisis could threaten Germany's fiscal position, Fitch says. We're still waiting for the latest Moody's view on France,  Britain and Slovenia with the former standing out since Moody's has already stripped Paris of its AAA rating and has it on negative outlook. French and German bond futures have moved higher at the open in anticipation of the French judgment and on the back of some weak U.S. and Chinese economic data. Ratings Friday is becoming a fixture since EU rules took force in the new year requiring ratings agencies to say precisely when they will make sovereign pronouncements and to do so outside market hours, so presumably we'll have to wait for Moody's until late in our day. Having said that, Moody's has already missed one of its scheduled delivery dates this year. Elsewhere, a suspected car bomb damaged a top security compound in Cairo, killing at least four people - three of them police - in one of the most high-profile attacks in months. The blast occurred a day before the third anniversary of the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak and raised hopes of a stable democracy. There were mixed signals from Turkey yesterday with the central bank forced to intervene to defend the lira. But the government successfully sold a chunky Eurobond, largely to international investors. The currency is back close to the level where the bank, which passed up the chance to raise interest rates this week, sold dollars. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan attends a meeting in Ankara to announce the city's mayoral candidates for March local elections and may well have something robust to say.
