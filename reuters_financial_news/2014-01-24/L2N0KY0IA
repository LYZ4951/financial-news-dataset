NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures dropped on Friday, putting the S&P 500 on track for a second week of declines, in the wake of a selloff in emerging market assets as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve will trim its stimulus measures further next week.

* As many market participants expect the Fed to continue to wind down its stimulus measures by an additional $10 billion a month next week, investors will look to less risky assets such as U.S. bonds, expecting interest rates will begin to rise. [ID:nL2N0J51S0] * A rout in emerging market assets spread to developed countries in Europe on worries over Fed policy, slowing growth in China and amid political problems in Turkey, Argentina and Ukraine.  * The Turkish lira <TRYTOM=D3> hit a fresh record low and the South African rand <ZAR=D3> hit a new five-year low against the dollar. U.S.-listed shares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. <BBVA.N> fell 4.7 percent to $12.08 in premarket trade a day after the country's peso currency suffered its steepest daily decline in 12 years. * Argentina's government said Friday it would loosen strict foreign exchange controls, after it abandoned its long-standing policy of supporting the peso currency by intervening in the foreign exchange market earlier this week. That resulted in the currency's steepest plunge since the 2002 financial crisis. [ID:nL2N0KY0FC] * The S&P 500 is down 0.6 percent for the week, putting it on pace for back-to-back weekly losses for the first time since September.  * Nine companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings on Friday. Procter & Gamble Co <PG.N> edged down 0.04 percent in light premarket trading after the world's largest household products maker reported a lower quarterly profit but left its 2014 sales growth forecast unchanged. [ID:nL2N0KY0H9]  * Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> gained 2.7 percent to $37.01 before the opening bell after the world's largest software company posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit. [ID:nL2N0KX2A2] * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> fell 13.5 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> dropped 111 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> lost 27.25 points. * Honeywell International Inc <HON.N> posted a higher fourth-quarter profit as sales increased across major segments of the diversified U.S. manufacturer. [ID:nL2N0KX19I] * European shares slipped to a one-week low, with stocks exposed to emerging markets hit by a rout in Latin American currencies and banks losing ground on concerns about their earnings outlook.
