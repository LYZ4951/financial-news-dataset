SHANGHAI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - China's money rates ended the week in mixed territory after the central bank attempted to head off another liquidity crunch on Monday with substantial cash injections, but traders are still anxious about cash supply.

Cash conditions relaxed after funds injections by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Tuesday and Thursday, but tightened on Friday, indicating sustained pressure on the interbank market was likely to last into next week.Market watchers said cash has been sucked out of ciruclation by seasonal demand for funds ahead  of the week-long Lunar New Year festival in February, combined with a resumption of initial public offerings (IPOs) in China this month.   The benchmark weighted-average seven-day bond repurchase rate <CN7DRP=CFXS> stood at 4.5384 by midday, down 67.02 basis points compared to last week's close, and down even more significantly from a high of 6.5920 it hit on Monday.  But, commonly traded rates remained up for the week and climbed on Friday despite massive fund injections during open market operations on Tuesday and Thursday.  The overnight repo rate rose over 72 basis points to 3.7171 at midday on Friday and 14-day repo stood at 6.8935, a jump of 70.56 bps from the day before and up over a full percentage point week-on-week. This suggests nervousness in the market, even after the central bank injected a net 375 billion yuan during open market operations this week, and some traders suspected that  the decline in the seven-day repo rate was not indicative of true market conditions. "The decrease of the seven-day repo rate reflects more the state of short-term liquidity demand over the next two or three days, instead the de facto seven-day transactions which actually steps into the holiday period," said a trader from a city commercial bank in Shanghai. INJECTION SERIES China experienced a series of dramatic cash crunches in the interbank market in 2013, and it appeared another one was on the way on Monday, when the seven-day repo rate again traded at 10 percent at one point. [ID:nL3N0KV1P4] To relax the market, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 375 billion yuan ($61.97 billion) into the interbank market -- 120 billion yuan of which via 21-day reverse repos that will keep cash in the system for the duration of the upcoming holiday week.  The central bank also announced that it had provided cash to major banks and smaller financing institutions through the standing lending facility (SLF).  But this was the first open market operations this year, and traders believe the PBOC is sticking to its de facto tightening stance in order to discourage risky shadow banking activities and encourage corporate deleveraging.  OFFSETTING EFFECTS Liquidity conditions seem to be improved, but not so much that market participants have relaxed their vigilance, given the likelihood that this week's fund injection could be quickly offset by other factors. "Short-term concerns may have been relieved, but the market is still worried about what will happen after the Spring Festival," said a trader from a foreign bank in Shanghai. Some predicted a return to monetary hard-ball after the holiday, as the central bank continues to engineer a long-term rise in money rates to discourage banks from abusing the interbank market to cover their riskiest bets. "Mother Central Bank injected funds, but it is still determined to kill pigs," wrote a commodities trader microblogging under the name Hedge Soldier. By "pigs," he was referring to the commercial bankers dabbling in shadow banking and evading regulations that regulators have been attempting to suppress. "In the new year, she'll be back to killing pigs," Hedge Soldier said. Cash demand for the upcoming holiday is always a major factor in China's money markets this time of year, but in 2014 another factor -- the resumption of IPOs -- has proven a dud so far. IPOs usually require funds to be frozen for short periods of time during the subscription period, and if the IPO is large, the impact of this freeze can impact short-term rates.  However, so far the resumption has had little noticeable impact on the money market.
