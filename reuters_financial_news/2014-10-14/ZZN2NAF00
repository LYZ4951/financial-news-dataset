SHANGHAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares ended slightly lower on Tuesday, erasing early gains as worries about cooling global growth continued to weigh on equity markets.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed down 0.4 percent at 23,047.97 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 0.3 percent. The market rallied in the morning after Hong Kong police moved to dismantle barriers erected by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Hong Kong markets have slid in the run-up to and during the protests, which began in early October.
