MUMBAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Indian shares edged down on Tuesday as DLF Ltd <DLF.NS> plunged after the market regulator banned it from tapping capital markets, although broader losses were capped as Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> gained after better-than-expected earnings and lenders rose on easing inflation data.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally closed 0.13 percent lower at 26,349.33, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> fell 0.19 percent to 7,869.40.
