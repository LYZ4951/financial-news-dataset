ZURICH, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Swiss-based Sonova <SOON.VX> unveiled new products on Tuesday that consume less energy and can connect wireless hearing aids to bluetooth enabled cell phones, as it looks to innovation to help maintain its lead as the world's top hearing aid maker.

The company said it had developed a new wireless Receiver-In-Canal (RIC) hearing aid, called Phonak Audeo V, which offers twice the processing power while reducing battery consumption by up to 30 percent.
