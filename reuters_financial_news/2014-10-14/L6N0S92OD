DUBAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Most stock markets in the Middle East fell on Tuesday as European stocks, which had led them up in the previous session, changed direction and U.S. equities continued to decline.

Dubai's bourse <.DFMGI> fell 2.9 percent to a one-month closing low of 4,572 points as all liquid stocks closed in the red. Heavyweight developer Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> dropped 3.7 percent and Dubai Islamic Bank <DISB.DU> fell 2.7 percent. Abu Dhabi's index <.ADI> fell 1.1 percent, although some stocks gained, including Union National Bank <UNB.AD> which rose 0.2 percent after brokerage EFG Hermes said on Monday it might secure a place in MSCI's emerging market index next month. "I think what's happening in the U.S. and international markets is pressuring the markets here in the region," said Ali Adou, portfolio manager at The National Investor in Abu Dhabi. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index <.FTEU3> rose in the first half of Monday's session, helping markets in the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia rebound. But it closed in the red on that day as worries about a weak global economy resurfaced, and the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> fell 1.7 percent on Monday to a five-month low. European stocks then fell further on Tuesday. Qatar's bourse <.QSI>, however, was more resilient and edged up 0.2 percent largely thanks to Qatar National Bank <QNBK.AD>, which rose 2.2 percent after reporting a 20.8 percent jump in third-quarter net profit earlier this week. QNB, whose results are generally viewed as a gauge for the health of the wider banking sector in Qatar, made a net profit of 2.9 billion riyals ($796.4 million) while the average forecast from six analysts polled by Reuters had been 2.57 billion riyals. Qatar is generally viewed as less vulnerable to a global downturn than most markets because of the government's record of spending to support the local corporate sector when needed.  SAUDI, EGYPT Saudi Arabia's main index <.TASI> fell 1.9 percent as most stocks, including blue chips, declined. However, some stocks, such as Saudi Cement Co <3030.SE>, Yanbu Cement Co <3060.SE>, Southern Province Cement Co <3050.SE> and Eastern Cement Co <3080.SE>, edged up. Cement production involves heating minerals to very high temperatures and the drop in oil prices could reduce energy costs for companies in the sector. Brent crude oil fell to a fresh low below $88 a barrel on Tuesday, trading at its weakest level since 2010 after the International Energy Agency cut its estimates for oil demand this year and next. [O/R] Egypt's bourse also remained in a profit-taking mood as virtually all stocks declined and the main index <.EGX30> fell 2.6 percent. Ezz Steel <ESRS.CA> was one of the few exceptions, jumping 3.4 percent after its subsidiary Al Ezz Dekheila Steel Co Alexandria said late on Monday that natural gas supplies to its plant had resumed. According to Naeem Brokerage, Al Ezz Dekheila accounts for more than 90 percent of the parent company's earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
