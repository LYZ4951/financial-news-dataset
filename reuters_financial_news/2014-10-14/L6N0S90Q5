MOSCOW, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Tuesday it had shifted the boundaries of its floating rouble corridor by 10 kopecks, following market interventions to curb the pace of the currency's decline.

As of Oct. 13, the new corridor extended from 36.35 to 45.35 against a dollar-euro basket <RUS=MCX>, compared with 36.25 to 45.25 previously.
