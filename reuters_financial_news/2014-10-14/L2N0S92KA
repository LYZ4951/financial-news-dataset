Oct 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup and Jefferies will lead a $140 million bond sale as soon as mid-November for New Jersey's cash-strapped gambling hub Atlantic City, an official told Reuters on Tuesday.

Citi will be senior manager on the $100 million tax-exempt portion of the sale, with Jefferies co-manager, said Atlantic City revenue director Michael Stinson.
