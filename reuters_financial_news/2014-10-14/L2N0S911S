NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - A New York state judge ruled on Tuesday the privately held producer of AriZona iced tea should pay about $1 billion to buy out the half of the beverage maker owned by the co-founder and his son.

Nassau County Supreme Court Justice Timothy Driscoll arrived at the amount the company must pay John Ferolito and a trust set up for his son after determining the value of Beverage Marketing USA Inc and its related entities approached $2 billion in 2010.
