SHANGHAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - China shares posted a third session of losses on Tuesday, erasing earlier gains in the day as investors took profits amid continuing weakness in global markets.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 0.3 percent at 2,360.08 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings also sank 0.3 percent. "The main reason for the market pulling back is that it's still under great profit-taking pressure after having hit some high levels before," said Xiao Shijun, an analyst at Guodu Securities in Beijing.
