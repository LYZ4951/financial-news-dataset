WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - A top official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday criticized the "broken windows" enforcement strategy being deployed by the agency, saying it hinders the agency's ability to set priorities and have robust, healthy markets.

In a speech at the annual Securities Enforcement Forum, SEC Republican Commissioner Mike Piwowar took aim at the approach that SEC Chair Mary Jo White has used, which entails pursuing cases against both big and small violations. "A broken windows approach to enforcement may not achieve the desired result," said Piwowar. "If every rule is a priority, then no rule is a priority." The SEC's "broken windows" enforcement policy is modeled after the theory used by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in his crackdown on crime in the city. Under that theory, making sure that the urban environment is well-maintained and that broken windows are fixed helps to deter even more-serious crimes. White, an independent appointed by President Barack Obama, unveiled her plans to apply the "broken windows" theory to the SEC's enforcement program in a speech at the same conference last year. In that speech, she said it was important to go after the more minor violations, because small ones "can feed bigger ones." But Piwowar said this idea was flawed because the "ultimate" goal of regulation is to achieve resilient markets, not regulatory compliance. "If you create an environment in which regulatory compliance is the most important objective for market participants, then we will have lost sight of the underlying purpose for having regulation in the first place," Piwowar said. He described the SEC's mission as protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient trading markets; and facilitating capital formation.  In his speech, which focused exclusively on SEC enforcement policy matters, Piwowar also raised concerns about the agency's approach to corporate penalties. The SEC only won the power to impose corporate penalties in 1990 but did not really start to hit companies with large fines until after the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. The practice is controversial because some critics like Piwowar say penalties can wind up hurting shareholders who may have already suffered harm because of the underlying wrongdoing by the company's executives. The SEC under former Chair Chris Cox, a Republican, created guidelines in 2006 that lay out the factors to consider when imposing penalties, such as the egregiousness of the conduct and the harm a fine might bring to shareholders. Chair White, however, said in a speech last year that this guidance, while helpful, is not binding. Piwowar said Tuesday that the SEC should be using the guidance and has failed to do so in recent months when weighing whether to bring enforcement cases. "We will have not accorded appropriate due process if we fail to follow our own publicly announced framework for monetary penalties," he said.
