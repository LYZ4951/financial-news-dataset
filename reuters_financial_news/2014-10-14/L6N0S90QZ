DUBAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Bank Sohar <BKSB.OM>, the Omani lender currently merging with larger rival Bank Dhofar <BDOF.OM>, has scrapped plans for a convertible bond issue and will instead undertake a 40 million rial ($103.9 million) rights issue, it said on Tuesday.

The bank, the sultanate's fifth-largest by assets, had said in May it would issue a mandatory convertible bond worth 70 million rials to help boost its Tier 1 - or core - capital. However, in a bourse filing on Tuesday, it said its board had decided against issuing the convertible "due to uncertainty regarding its eligibility as an additional Tier 1 instrument". Instead, Bank Sohar will complete a rights issue, subject to regulatory approval, for a smaller amount as "this is the capital requirement to support the future growth of the bank", with a further 30 million rial issue possible in the future if the lender required the extra capital. Bank Sohar's Tier 1 ratio was 10.39 percent at the end of the second quarter, with its total capital adequacy ratio - combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 (or supplementary) capital - at 13.90 percent, according to figures on its website.
