LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - HSBC <HSBA.L> has fired two London-based currency traders, including Serge Sarramengna, who had been the bank's chief dealer, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The other dealer is Edward Pinto, who traded Scandinavian currencies.  Both were suspended in January, along with several other traders at many of the world's biggest banks as a global investigation into allegations of collusion and manipulation in the $5.3 trillion-a-day market gathered steam. It is unclear whether the two departures from HSBC are related to this probe.  Neither Sarramengna or Pinto could be immediately reached for comment.
