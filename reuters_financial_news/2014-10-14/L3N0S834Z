BANGKOK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Thailand's TMB Bank Pcl <TMB.BK> said on Tuesday third-quarter net profit surged 27 percent from a year earlier, helped by a pick-up in loan growth and on lower funding cost.

The country's seventh-largest lender by assets reported a net profit of 2.39 billion baht ($73.74 million) for the July-September period, higher than the average 2 billion baht forecast by four analysts polled by Reuters.   Loans grew 3.3 percent from the previous quarter, driven by lending to corporates and medium- to small-sized companies. TMB is 31 percent owned by Dutch financial service company ING Groep <ING.AS> and 26 percent by the Thai Finance Ministry.
