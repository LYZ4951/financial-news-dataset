DUBAI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Hollandi Bank <1040.SE>, Saudi Arabia's oldest lender, posted a 6.6 percent gain in third-quarter net profit on Tuesday, in line with analyst expectations.

The lender, partly-owned by Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L>, said it made 461.8 million riyals ($123.1 million) in the three months to September 30 compared with 433.3 million riyals in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Five analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast it would post, on average, a net profit of 465.9 million riyals. [ID:L6N0S20O4] The bank attributed the rise to an increase in total operating income, which rose 21.2 percent year-on-year to 808.7 million riyals, without elaborating. Saudi companies issue brief earnings statements early in the reporting period before publishing more detailed results later.
