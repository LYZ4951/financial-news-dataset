Oct 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. market has been hit hard in recent days, with the S&P 500 registering its worst three-day slide since 2011, before buyers emerged on Tuesday.

On Monday, the benchmark S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average, an important measure of the longer-term trend in the equity market, for the first time since Nov. 16, 2012.  The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq Composite have also fallen below support levels, while the Russell 2000 has entered correction territory, defined as a decline of more than 10 percent from the high. "This is the most back-and-forth activity we've seen since 2011," said Frank Cappelleri, technical market analyst and trader at Instinet LLC. "We shouldn't discount the chance of volatility sticking around for a while."  The following factbox shows the percentage of stocks trading below their 200-day moving average and an index's measure of "relative strength," a technical indicator that identifies possible shifts in momentum. An "oversold" index is one that technical analysts see as likely to rebound before long; an "overbought" index is in danger of declines.
