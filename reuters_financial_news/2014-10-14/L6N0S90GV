MOSCOW, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Tuesday that it had conducted 1.72 billion roubles ($42.52 million) worth of forex interventions to defend the rouble on Oct. 10.

The central bank releases its interventions data with a two-day lag. But the above figure shows only the rouble amount of what the central bank spent that day selling euros. Because of the holiday in the United States dollar expenditures for Oct. 10 are expected to be released on Oct. 15.
