Oct 14 (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer Ann Inc <ANN.N> said it had entered into a non-disclosure agreement with private equity firm Golden Gate Capital, a month after some hedge funds pushed the company to sell itself.

Ann said on Tuesday that it had engaged in "a collaborative, constructive dialogue" with Golden Gate after the investment firm reported a 9.5 percent stake in the retailer on March 20. [ID:nPn6TmVxs] Last month, hedge funds Red Alder LLC and Engine Capital urged Ann to consider selling itself to a private equity firm or another apparel company, stepping up pressure on the company to improve its performance.
