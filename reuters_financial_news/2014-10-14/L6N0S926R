ATHENS, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Greek shares fell 4 percent on Tuesday to their lowest level since September 2013, with traders citing fears of snap elections.

At 0936 GMT, the Athens stock exchange index <.ATG> was down 4 percent, led by a 5-percent drop in bank shares <.FTATBNK>. "There is a mini sell-off today because of the ongoing political uncertainty," an Athens-based trader said, declining to be named.  "With the ten-year (government) bond yield above 7 percent it appears the government's plans for an early bailout exit could be at risk."
