LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Just Retirement Group <JRG.L> said on Tuesday it had completed its largest ever defined benefit pension de-risking deal and was confident of meeting its full-year sales targets.

The 75 million pounds ($120.44 million) deal was structured as a buy-in deal and contracted in September, it said in a statement, although it gave no further details as all the members of the scheme in question had yet to be informed.
