SEOUL, Oct 14 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged higher on Tuesday to snap a three-day losing streak, finding support from bargain hunters after slumping to a fresh 7-month closing low in the previous session.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> drifted 0.11 percent higher to close at 1,929.25 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> firmed on Tuesday, tracking the dollar's decline as the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted at a possible delay in raising interest rates in light of recent signs that global growth may be losing traction.
