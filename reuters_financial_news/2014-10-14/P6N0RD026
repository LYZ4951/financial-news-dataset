PARIS, Oct 14 (Reuters) - European shares fell early on Tuesday, tracking sharp losses on Wall Street and resuming their three-week sell-off, dragged by mounting concerns over the strength of the global economy.

Shares in British luxury brand Burberry <BRBY.L> featured among the top losers across Europe, down 4.1 percent after warning that market conditions were becoming more difficult, partly offsetting reduced currency headwinds. [ID:nL6N0S90NB]
