Oct 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> reported a third-quarter profit, as the biggest U.S. bank moved past the huge legal claims that caused it to book a rare loss in the same quarter last year, according to an apparently authentic document posted on website shareholder.com.

The bank posted net income of $5.6 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $380 million in the year-earlier quarter, the document showed. (http://bit.ly/1w5qBfr) A JP Morgan spokeswoman in the United States said she had no immediate comment. The bank was hit last year by an after-tax expense of $7.2 billion to settle government allegations of wrongdoing related to mortgage instruments before the financial crisis.
