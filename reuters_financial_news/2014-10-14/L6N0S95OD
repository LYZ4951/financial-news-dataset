DUBLIN, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Ireland's permanent tsb (PTSB) <IPM.I> is strong enough to raise capital from private investors and will not require further state assistance if it encounters problems in upcoming European stress tests, finance minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday.

The state-owned mortgage lender said last week it had appointed Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> to advise it on its future return to private ownership. The Sunday Times reported that the German bank was on standby to help raise capital if the stress tests required it. [ID:nL6N0S70MA]
