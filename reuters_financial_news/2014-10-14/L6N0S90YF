STOCKHOLM, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Swedish home prices rose by 0.5 percent in September from August and were up 11.2 percent from a year earlier, the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) showed on Tuesday.

Prices for apartments increased 14.5 percent while single-family house prices rose 9.4 percent on the year. The HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends. A boom in Swedish home prices since the late 1990s has driven up household debt to some of the highest levels in Europe.
