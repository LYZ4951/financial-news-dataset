LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - European stock markets trimmed earlier losses on Tuesday, with Britain's FTSE <.FTSE> and Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> in positive territory, with traders citing a rise in U.S. equity futures on the back of positive corporate earnings.

The FTSE was up by 0.2 percent and the DAX by 0.1 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> index stood at 1,289.57 points - down 0.3 percent on the day but still up from its earlier intraday 8-month low of 1,274.87 points. "There were reasonably good results from Citigroup and U.S. futures are also up. That's helping us come up off these oversold levels," said a London-based trader, who declined to be named.
