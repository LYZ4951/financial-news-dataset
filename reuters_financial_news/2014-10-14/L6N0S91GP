LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Sterling fell to a one-month low against the euro while 10-year gilt yields dropped to the lowest since June last year after UK inflation slowed more than expected, pushing back expectations of a rise in UK interest rates.

Sterling extended its losses on the day to 0.75 percent, falling as low $1.5959 <GBP=D4>, its lowest in a month and not far from an 11-month low of $1.5943 struck earlier this month. The euro rose 0.25 percent to 79.475 pence, its highest level in four weeks. <EURGBP=D4> British 10-year government bond yields <GB10YT=RR> fell by more than 3 basis points after the data to hit a low of 2.136 percent, a level last seen in June last year. Gilts' yield spread over Bunds <EU10YT=RR> tightened by more than 3 basis points to as little as 125.0 basis points, while the December gilt future <FLGZ4> hit a contract high and short sterling interest rate futures rallied strongly <0#FSS:>.
