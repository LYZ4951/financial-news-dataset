VIENNA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Austrian banks that have used Russia as a major profit centre face more problems in future given the political and economic situation, the central bank said on Monday.

"Russia was until now a strong earnings driver given very high credit quality (but) the current situation with sanctions, recession (and) a drop in oil prices does not of course point to an improvement but rather a worsening," central bank supervisory official Philip Reading told a news conference.
