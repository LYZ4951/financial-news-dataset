NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc <MRK.N> is approaching banks about an $8 billion, 364-day bridge loan that will back the drugmaker's plans to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc <CBST.O>, sources told Thomson Reuters LPC.

JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are leading the deal.  The loan has a drawn cost of LIB+75 if Merck keeps its current rating of AA/A2, sources said.  Further details were not available by press time.  Merck announced December 8 that it would buy Cubist for $9.5 billion. The transaction will include $1.1 billion of net debt.  The Cubist purchase will give Merck access to antibiotic Cubicin, Reuters said. Cubist also has a drug in development for complicated urinary tract infections.  The deal signals that large pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention back to antibiotics after decades of low investment, according to Reuters.
