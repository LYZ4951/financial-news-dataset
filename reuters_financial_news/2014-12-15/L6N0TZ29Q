MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The Russian central bank probably intervened to support the rouble on Monday after it fell to a record low of over 61 roubles per dollar, two traders said.

The rouble strengthened sharply around 1310 GMT, moving from over 61.20 roubles per dollar to below 60 roubles per dollar <RUBUTSTN=MCX> in a matter of seconds.
