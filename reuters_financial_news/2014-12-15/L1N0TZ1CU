WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Minnesota's attorney general has expressed concern about the merger of food distribution giants Sysco Corp <SYY.N> and US Foods [USFOO.UL], saying it was questionable whether any divestiture could restore competition lost to the transaction.

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson said in a Dec. 10 letter that her office had heard complaints from Minnesota-based restaurants that the $3.5 billion acquisition would leave them "fewer choices among distributors and potentially resulting in higher prices for consumers."
