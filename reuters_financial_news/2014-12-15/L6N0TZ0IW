VIENNA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Austrian lighting group Zumtobel <ZUMV.VI> will increasingly focus on providing packages of services rather than just hardware, Chief Executive Ulrich Schumacher told magazine Trend.

"We will develop increasingly in future into a software supplier, a kind of Google of the lighting industry," he was quoted as saying in an interview published on Monday. He cited as an example complementing ceiling lighting with movement sensors or cameras to make it into an alarm system, or adding wireless modules to create an internet network.
