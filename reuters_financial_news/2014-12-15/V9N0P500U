VIENNA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Austrian banks should strengthen their capital bases further to reflect new regulatory standards and their exposure to emerging markets in central and eastern Europe, Austria's central bank said on Monday.

In its semi-annual financial stability report, it urged banks to tackle credit risks and keep cutting costs, noting the bank sector's aggregate common equity tier 1 ratio - at around 11.8 percent at mid-2014 - lagged that of international peers.
