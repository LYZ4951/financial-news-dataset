WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission moved on Monday to dismiss insider-trading proceedings against a man accused of illegally trading in Herbalife <HLF.N>.

The SEC's enforcement division sought to dismiss the civil charges against Jordan Peixoto because two crucial witnesses were not available for the March 16, 2015 trial, according to a filing dated Monday. The SEC had alleged that Peixoto made $47,100 in 2012 by trading illegally in Herbalife put options after a friend shared news that hedge fund manager William Ackman was about to reveal a big bet against the diet supplement company. Peixoto was an analyst at accounting firm Deloitte & Touche at the time. In October, he sued to stop the regulator from continuing the case.
