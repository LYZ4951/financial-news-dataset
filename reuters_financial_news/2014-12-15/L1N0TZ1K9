WASHINGTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Massachusetts-based manufacturer Bruker Corp <BRKR.O> will pay $2.4 million to settle civil charges alleging it violated federal bribery laws by providing improper payments to Chinese government officials in exchange for business, U.S. regulators said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Bruker lacked adequate internal controls to prevent or detect about $230,000 in payments doled out to China.
