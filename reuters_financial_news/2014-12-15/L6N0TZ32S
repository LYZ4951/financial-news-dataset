VIENNA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Germany's BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] lost a court case seeking compensation from a staff foundation at Austrian lender Hypo Alpe Adria over the German bank's allegations that it was duped in 2007 into buying the lender, the Austria Press Agency (APA) reported.

BayernLB had used the suit against the MAPS foundation - which owned a small stake in Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL] - as a test case for potentially seeking damages from other former owners of the bank, which Austria nationalised in 2009 and is now being wound down. [ID:nL5N0J64B3]
