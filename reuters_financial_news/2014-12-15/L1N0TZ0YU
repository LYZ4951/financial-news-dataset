NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - American Realty Capital Properties Inc <ARCP.O>, the real estate investment trust that creates alternative investments sold to retail investors, said on Monday that Executive Chairman Nicholas Schorsch and its two other most senior officers had stepped down.

David Kay, who had replaced Schorsch as chief executive officer in the fall, also left, along with ARCP President and Chief Operating Officer Lisa Beeson, the company said. ARCP said it was unwinding relationships in other entities with which Schorsch is affiliated.
