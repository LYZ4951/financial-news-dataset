JOHANNESBURG, Dec 15 (Reuters) - South African financial services group MMI Holdings Ltd <MMIJ.J> is to buy a local stock brokerage house from Botswana's Imara Holdings <IMRA.BT> to increase its exposure to wealthier investors, it said on Monday.

The 120 million rand ($10.38 million) cash purchase of Imara SP Reid would also cut costs incurred by MMI's asset management arm on external brokers.
