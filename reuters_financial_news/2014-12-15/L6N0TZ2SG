ROME, Dec 15 (Reuters) - European Central Bank governing council member Ignazio Visco said on Monday that he supports significant bond buying by the central bank if inflation continues to be very low or slides into deflation.

"If new inflation figures confirm the persistence or even the worsening of the risks to price stability in the euro area, then it would be necessary to start rather quickly further interventions to buy bonds on a large scale with the aim of bringing the Eurosystem balance sheet to desired levels," Visco said in testimony in parliament.
