MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Russia's Finance Ministry said on Monday it did not support the idea of forced foreign currency sales by domestic companies.

Russian lawmakers have proposed introducing a requirement that domestic firms with foreign currency earnings should sell a portion of them to support the rouble, which is down more than 40 percent against the dollar this year.
