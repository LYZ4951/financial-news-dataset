CAIRO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Monday and was unchanged on the unofficial market after the government established a fourth weekly dollar auction.

The bank offered $40 million and said it had sold $38 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBOE> a dollar, a rate unchanged from its last sale on Sunday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. In the unofficial market, the pound was trading at about 7.70 to the dollar on Monday, unchanged from the previous day, one trader said. Sunday's sale was the first since the government announced it would add a fourth weekly auction to those it already holds on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. [ID:nL6N0TV46Z]
