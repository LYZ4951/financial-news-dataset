VIENNA, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Austrian National Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny expects Austrian lenders to stay in Russia as an "element of stability" despite stormy political and economic conditions there, he said on Monday. Banks such as Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> and Bank Austria <CRDI.MI> are active there.

Nowotny told reporters Austrian banks have over years built a reputation in Russia for staying the course through crises. "I assume that also now when there are difficult times that Austrian banks are prepared to stay on board and prove themselves to be an element of stability. As far as Ukraine goes, that is of course a much more difficult question."
