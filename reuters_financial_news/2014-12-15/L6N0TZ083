DUBAI, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Qatar's Barwa Real Estate <BRES.QA> has won a 750 million riyals ($206 million) contract from a government company to build and operate low cost-warehouses, Barwa said on Monday.

The 25-year arrangement was awarded by state-owned Manateq, according to a statement to Doha's bourse. It did not state how many warehouses Barwa would build but did say the construction would take place within a two-year period. Manateq develops and operates specialised economic zones in Qatar, with the aim of providing infrastructure to help the development of private sector business, according to its website.
