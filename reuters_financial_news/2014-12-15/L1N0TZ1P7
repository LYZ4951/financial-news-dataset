SAO PAULO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The International Finance Corp [IFK.UL], the World Bank's investment-banking arm, and a group of partners agreed on Monday to extend $255 million in loans to Rede D'Or São Luiz SA, helping Brazil's largest hospital chain boost coverage.

Washington, D.C.-based IFC will lend $50 million from its own account, and helped arrange another $205 million in a syndicated loan with Banco Santander SA <SANB4.SA>, Citigroup Inc <C.N>, Proparco and the IFC managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program, it said in a statement.  This is IFC's second investment in Rede D'Or, it added. The loans should help bolster private sector presence in Brazil's $200 billion healthcare industry, which is growing rapidly but is increasingly facing a shortage of hospital capacity and qualified healthcare professionals.
