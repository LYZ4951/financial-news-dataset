FRANKFURT, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Russia-focused Austrian property firm Immofinanz <IMFI.VI> said on Monday it was heading for a net loss in the second quarter of its 2014/15 financial year due to an increase in income tax expenses.

"Net profit for Q2 2014/15 is expected to reflect the first quarter, and therefore a negative result," Immofinanz said in a statement.   In the first quarter of its current financial year from May through July, when the rouble strengthened against the euro and the dollar, foreign exchange based revaluations pushed Immofinanz to a net loss.
