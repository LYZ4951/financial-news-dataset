LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Russian companies' dollar bonds suffered a fresh heavy selloff on Monday, hit by the rouble's fall past the 60-per-dollar level.

Bonds from key Russian companies such as oil firms Lukoil and Rosneft <LKOH.MM> <ROSN.MM> fell between 1.0 and 2.0 cents in the dollar <US549876AH32=R> <XS086198118=TE>. State-run banks Sberbank and VEB <XS030099877=TE> <XS030099877=TE> saw their dollar issues tumble 2.0 and 0.5 cents respectively. Investors fear that the rouble's relentless depreciation will make debt repayments harder for companies, especially those that lack dollar revenues. Their desperate scramble for dollars is partly behind the rouble's losses. The currency fell 4 percent on Monday to 60.6 per dollar <RUB=> Jefferies analyst Richard Segal said the selloff in companies' Eurobonds was "mirroring the plunge in the rouble even as oil prices are unchanged on the day."
