PARIS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - European stocks briefly trimmed their gains on Monday after four gunmen took a hostage in an apartment in the Belgian city of Ghent.

Police were called after the four armed men were seen entering a building in the Dampoort district of the city on Monday morning. A spokeswoman for prosecutors said that the four had taken a man hostage there. [ID:nL6N0TZ1H6] News of the hostage-taking emerged after a security scare in Australia hit just hours earlier. An armed man walked into a downtown Sydney cafe, took hostages and forced them to display an Islamic flag, stoking fears of a jihadist attack. [ID:nL3N0TY0SG]
