TORONTO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver said again on Monday he was confident the federal government would balance the budget next year, even given volatile oil prices.

He also repeated that he was monitoring the housing market following reports of overvaluation and would take steps to deal, if necessary, to deal with the matter, but does not see a property bubble.
