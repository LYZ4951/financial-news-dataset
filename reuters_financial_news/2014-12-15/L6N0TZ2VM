MOSCOW, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank said on Monday it saw a high likelihood of Russia's annual economic growth rate slipping into negative territory in the first quarter of next year.

The bank also said in a monetary policy document that it could reach its mid-term inflation target of 4 percent by the end of 2017 but that would require keeping monetary policy tight next year.
