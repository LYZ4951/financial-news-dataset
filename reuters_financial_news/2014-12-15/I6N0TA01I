MILAN, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> fell more than 5 percent to an all-time low on Monday as investors were still cautious about the two Italian banks that still need to raise capital to comply with European Central Bank rules.

At 1409 GMT, Monte dei Paschi shares were down 5.1 percent at 0.54 euros, their lowest in history and also making the stock the worst performer among Italian banks <.FITT8300>. Shares in smaller peer Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> were down 3.5 percent at 0.06 euros.
