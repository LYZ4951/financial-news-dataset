Dec 15 (Reuters) - Banks will repay 11.5 billion euros of the first round of long-term crisis ECB loans next week, about a quarter of the 40 billion euros they are set to repay on Wednesday, a Reuters poll showed.

Banks took a fresh injection of long-term credit from the European Central Bank last week, and this week's 40 billion euros to be repaid is much higher than earlier returns. That suggests some banks may have been encouraged by the fresh funding to repay their earlier borrowings.

Last week, banks borrowed close to 130 billion euros in the second round of targeted four-year, or 'TLTRO', loans offered by the ECB. [ID:nF9N0RK022] But that amount, together with the 82.6 billion euros taken in October, only brings the total to slightly higher than half the 400 billion euros the ECB wanted to lend. ECB chief Mario Draghi wants to increase the bank's balance sheet to March 2012 levels of around 3 trillion euros as part of his battle to bring inflation back near its 2 percent target ceiling. The poll also showed that at the weekly operation, the ECB will allot 96.5 billion euros next week, less than the 105 billion maturing this week. It will allot 12.0 billion euros at a three-month operation, slightly more than the 11 billion maturing.
