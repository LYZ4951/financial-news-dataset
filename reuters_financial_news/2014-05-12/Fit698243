May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Financials posted more bond volume growth than  industrials in the first quarter, propelling the U.S. corporate bond market  closer to $5 trillion, according to Fitch Ratings. The trend is due to both  improved bank lending activity and favorable borrowing conditions. Until  recently, the U.S. corporate bond market's growth, up 36% since 2009, had been  fueled almost exclusively by non-financial issuance.  The universe of financial bonds expanded 4% to $1.42 trillion in the first  quarter of 2014 while industrial issues grew 2% to $3.43 trillion. Refinancing  continued to represent a healthy portion of newly originated bonds -- about  one-half of the $242 billion sold in the first three months of the year.  However, in terms of net new debt, financials posted more growth than  industrials.  Financial volume peaked at $1.9 trillion in 2007 and contracted to $1.3 trillion  post crisis. From 2010 through 2012, volume remained range bound at this level.  In 2013, financial issues grew 7% year over year while industrials rose 10%.   The average coupon of investment-grade financial and industrial bonds sold in  the first quarter of 2014 was 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively. At current rates and  with sustained issuance volumes, borrowing costs on the existing stock of  financial and industrial corporate bonds should continue to contract this year.  The average coupon of outstanding financial issues declined to 4.8% at the end  of March from 4.9% at year-end 2013 and 5.1% a year earlier. The average  industrial coupon was similarly down to 5.5% in March versus 5.6% three months  earlier and 5.8% a year ago.  Floating-rate bonds' visibility increased in the first quarter of 2014. The  issues represented 12% of newly originated bonds -- 23% of financial bonds and a  multiyear high of 7% of new industrial bonds. The return of floating-rate bonds  and a modest shift to shorter term debt maturities is a sign of a more balanced  and less risk-averse market. Downgrades and upgrades combined affected 1.2% of U.S. corporate bond market  volume in the first quarter of 2014. Even across speculative-grade issues,  rating activity on a par basis was fairly stable in the first quarter, with  downgrades affecting 1.9% of bonds and upgrades affecting 1.7%.
