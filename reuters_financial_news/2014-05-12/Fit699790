May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that there are significant challenges ahead for Dutch life and health insurers.  Low interest rates have affected Dutch life insurers' ability to meet guaranteed  returns. In the health insurance market, there is political and public opinion  pressure for premium rate reductions. However, the Dutch non-life market is  expected to continue to be profitable, despite high pricing competition.
