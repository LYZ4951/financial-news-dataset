VIENNA, May 12 (Reuters) - Stepped-up supervision of the banking sector could drive some risky activity into the shadow banking sector, European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said on Monday.

"There is a danger that intensified regulation in the banking sector might cause important and risky business activities to be shifted into less regulated areas such as shadow banking entities," he said in remarks prepared for a conference on banking union.
