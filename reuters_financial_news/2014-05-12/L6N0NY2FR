DUBLIN, May 12 (Reuters) - State-owned Allied Irish Banks (AIB) <ALBK.I> returned to a operating profit after provisions for the first time since its 2010 bailout in the first quarter, hitting a landmark many analysts had expected later in the year.

AIB last year made its first operating profit excluding provisions for impaired loans and said it expected to post a profit including provisions by the end of the year.
