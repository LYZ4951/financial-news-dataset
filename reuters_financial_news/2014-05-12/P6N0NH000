PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Monday, with France's Alstom <ALSO.PA> rallying after Germany said it would support a tie-up with Siemens <SIEGn.DE>.

At 0708 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,357.98 points. Shares in Alstom - which is reviewing a bid by U.S. giant General Electric <GE.N> for its energy activities - were up 2.1 percent after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday that the German government would support a tie-up between Siemens and Alstom if the companies decided that it made sense. [ID:nL6N0NW08K] Miners were also on the rise, climbing along with metal prices, with Rio Tinto <RIO.L> up 2.5 percent and BHP Billiton <BLT.L> up 1.5 percent. The market's gains were seen as being limited, however, by tensions in Ukraine following Sunday's referendum in eastern provinces. [ID:nL6N0NX0RF]
