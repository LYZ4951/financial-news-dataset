DUBAI, May 12 (Reuters) - Aldar Properties <ALDR.AD>, Abu Dhabi's biggest real estate developer, reported a three-fold increase in first-quarter net profit on Monday, driven by unit handovers and growth in recurring revenues.

The developer's profit rose to 453.4 million dirhams ($123.4 million) in the quarter from 154.3 million dirhams in the same period of 2013, it said in a statement. SICO Bahrain had forecast the firm would make 329.8 million dirhams in the quarter. [ID:nL6N0NJ0EA]
