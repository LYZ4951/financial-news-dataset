May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The U.S. CMBS delinquency rate held mostly steady in  April following significant declines in the prior two months, according to the  latest index results from Fitch Ratings. CMBS delinquencies ticked down three basis points (bps) in April to 5.13% from  5.16% a month earlier. This marks the smallest drop in over a year, after  declines of 10 bps or more in nine of the past 12 months. The CW bulk sale has  recently concluded; none of the servicers currently have assets marketed as part  of a bulk sale. The largest new delinquency was the $80 million 1111 Marcus Avenue loan (JPMMC  2006-FL2), secured by a condominium interest in an office complex in New Hyde  Park, NY. Meanwhile, the largest resolution was the $80.5 million Central Parke  Pool (WBCMT 2006-C25), a real estate owned (REO) asset that was sold for a 61%  loss. In total, resolutions of $689 million in April outpaced new additions to the  index of $561 million. Current and previous delinquency rates are as follows: --Industrial: 6.67% (from 6.74% in March); --Multifamily: 5.97% (from 6.03%); --Office: 5.43% (from 5.36%); --Hotel: 5.18% (from 5.35%); --Retail: 5.11% (from 5.15%).
