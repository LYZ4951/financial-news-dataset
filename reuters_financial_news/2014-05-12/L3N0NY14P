SINGAPORE, May 12 (Reuters) - Singapore shares started the week down on Monday as investors stayed on the sidelines of the market ahead of a public holiday, while the broader Asian market fell on growing concerns over the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

The benchmark Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> fell 0.7 percent to 3,230.01 points by 0502 GMT, led by heavy losses in Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd <JSH.SI> and Jardine Matheson Holdings <JARD.SI>, which slumped as much as 4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively. Investors watched the crisis brewing in Ukraine with caution, and many preferred to lay low ahead of a public holiday in Singapore on Tuesday. "We're going into holiday break tomorrow so the market is not confident about holding shares over the break. The U.S. also did a bit of a see-saw, so investors aren't convinced," said Carey Wong, investment analyst at OCBC investment research. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was up 0.4 percent. [MKTS/GLOB] DBS Group Holdings Ltd <DBSM.SI> fell as much as 2.6 percent to a near one-month low of S$16.64, as the stock hit its ex-dividend date.
