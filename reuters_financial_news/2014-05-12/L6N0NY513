MADRID, May 12 (Reuters) - Spanish lender Liberbank <LBK.MC>, which needed state aid during the financial crisis, said on Monday it had given Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> a mandate to lead a banking syndicate hired to carry out its capital raising plans.

The 500-million-euro ($688 million) rights issue, announced in March, is aimed at repaying government aid and strengthening its capital base and could pave the way to the bank resuming dividend payments. In a regulatory filing, Liberbank said it had named Citigroup <C.N>, BBVA <BBVA.MC>, Santander <SAN.MC> and Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> as joint bookrunners and Ahorro Corporacion, Espirito Santo Investment Bank, JB Capital Markets, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and brokerage Nmas1 as co-managers. Liberbank, which returned to profitability last year after reporting a 1.8 billion euro loss in 2012, said net profit more than tripled to 113 million euros in the first quarter to March 31 from a year earlier.
