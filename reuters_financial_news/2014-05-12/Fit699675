May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned China Cinda Asset  Management Co., Ltd's <1359.HK> (Cinda; A/Stable) USD1bn 4% senior unsecured notes due  2019 and USD500m 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024 final ratings of 'A'.  The proceeds will be used for working capital, investment and other general  corporate purposes. The notes, to be issued by China Cinda Finance (2014) Limited, are to be  unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Well Kent International Investment  Company Limited (Well Kent), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cinda. Cinda has granted a keepwell deed and a deed of equity interest purchase,  investment and liquidity support undertaking to ensure that the guarantor, Well  Kent, has sufficient assets and liquidity to meet its obligations under the  guarantee for the US dollar notes. The notes are rated at the same level as Cinda's Issuer Default Rating, given  the strong link between Well Kent and Cinda and the keepwell deed and the deed  of equity interest purchase, investment and liquidity support undertaking, which  provide additional support and transfer the ultimate responsibility of payment  to Cinda. In Fitch's opinion, both the keepwell deed and the deed of equity interest  purchase, investment and liquidity support undertaking signal a strong intention  from Cinda to ensure that Well Kent has sufficient funds to honour the proposed  debt obligations. The agency also believes Cinda intends to maintain its  reputation and credit profile in the international offshore market, and is  unlikely to default on offshore obligations. Additionally a default of Well Kent  could have significant negative repercussions on Cinda for any future offshore  funding. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming  to information already received. The final rating is in line with the expected  rating assigned on 29 April 2014.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Rating Linked to Sovereign: Cinda's ratings are linked to China's sovereign  ratings (A+/Stable) and notched one down from the sovereign. This reflects its  central state ownership, the state's strong control over the company via the  Ministry of Finance (MOF) and China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and  Cinda's strategic ties with the state, which result in a strong likelihood of  extraordinary state support, if needed. Therefore, Cinda is classified as a  dependent public sector entity under Fitch's criteria. Strong Control and Supervision: The MOF holds 67.84% of Cinda while the National  Social Security Fund (NSSF), which is directly administered by the central  government, holds 8.19%. As its controlling shareholder, the MOF nominates a  majority of Cinda's board members and exerts the strongest influence on  operation of the board. As one of Cinda's regulatory authorities, the MOF also  exerts significant influence and regulatory powers on its business operations.  By law, Cinda's senior management are scrutinized and approved by the CBRC,  which also has significant influence on its business operations through industry  and business activity supervision. To effectively communicate with its  controlling shareholder and regulatory authorities, Cinda's senior management  reports its operational and financial conditions to the MOF and CBRC on a  regular basis.  Strategic Importance: Cinda is one of four asset management companies (AMCs)  established to prevent and defuse financial risks, preserve state-owned assets  and promote the reform of the financial system in China. These AMCs are also the  wholesalers for non-performing assets (NPAs) under a policy that grants the  companies privileges in both transferring bulk NPAs and acquiring NPAs in  different regions of China. Leading Industry Position: Cinda led in terms of total revenue, net profit and  net assets among the big four AMCs in 2013. Its accumulated distressed asset  acquisition and cash recovery also accounted for 35.5% and 38.3% of the  aggregate of the big four AMCs at end-2012. Moreover, it is the first AMC  allowed by CBRC to acquire distressed assets from non-financial enterprises and  one of two AMCs that have been granted permission by the central bank to access  the interbank market. Risk from Rapid Expansion: The rapid growth in Cinda's distressed asset  portfolio in the past three years raises concerns over operational risks and  potential pressure on its capital adequacy despite its recent IPO. However,  Fitch believes its industry experience and seasoned management partly mitigate  the risk. Inherited and Concentration Risk: As a distressed asset manager, Cinda's  portfolio carries more inherited credit risk than a normal loan portfolio.  Concentration risk also arises from Cinda's exposure to the Chinese property and  coal mining sectors, which account for a meaningful portion of its distressed  receivable portfolio and of its debt-to-equity swap (DES) asset portfolio at  end-2013. However, the low collateral ratio (40%) of Cinda's distressed  receivable portfolio and the high potential of value appreciation of its DES  asset portfolio partly neutralise the concentration risk. Mismatched Asset and Liabilities: Cinda is mainly funded by short- to  medium-term borrowings, while its distressed asset portfolio has a medium- to  long-term maturity. However, the company's large outstanding credit facilities  and long-term relationships with various banks and financial institutions partly  mitigate the risks arising from the mismatch in assets and liabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive or negative rating action could stem from a similar change in the  ratings of the sovereign. Also stronger explicit support could result in an  equalisation of the rating with the sovereign. However, significant dilution of Cinda's core activities in the purchase and  management of non-performing assets could lead to a widening in the notching  from the sovereign's rating.
