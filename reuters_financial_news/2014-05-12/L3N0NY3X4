MUMBAI, May 12 (Reuters) - Indian shares surged to their second consecutive record high on Monday as blue-chips such as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> jumped on rising hopes that exit polls would show the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies winning a majority in the elections.

The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose as much as 2.52 percent to a record high at 23,572.88, while the broader NSE index <.NSEI> rose as much as 2.35 percent to a life high of 7,020.05, surpassing its previous record hit on Friday. The optimism comes even as exit polls by media organisations - due to be released after 1830 India time on Monday (1300 GMT) once the last votes are cast - have proven unreliable in the past. Actual results for India's five-week long elections are due on Friday.  A win for a BJP-led coalition is widely seen as setting the stage for a revival in confidence, investment and growth as Asia's third-largest economy steers through a rough patch. India's NSE index <.NSEI> has surged 18.74 percent since Narendra Modi became the BJP candidate on Sept. 13, as the opposition party is perceived by markets as being more business friendly at a time when the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a decade. "Markets got a wind of exit poll showing a clear majority for the BJP-led allies, which got extrapolated as better growth prospects for India," said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities. The BSE index ended up 2.42 percent at 23,551, while the NSE index ended 2.27 percent higher at 7,014.25, adding to their over 3 percent gains on Friday. Gains were broad-based, with 25 out of 30 listed companies on the benchmark BSE index posting rises. However, risk was also seen increasing as NSE's volatility index, or India VIX <.NIFVIX>, hit its highest intraday level since March 11, 2009, before ending 1.6 percent lower. [ID:nL3N0NY1RB] Also on watch, consumer price inflation data due later in the day, the last one before the central bank's next policy review on June 3. Domestic-oriented shares led the rally, with the NSE bank sub-index <.NSEBANK> hitting a record high. State Bank of India Ltd <SBI.NS> gained 3.2 percent, while Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS> rose 3.3 percent. Infrastructure shares also gained, with Ambuja Cements <ABUJ.NS> up 2.1 percent, while state-run power equipment maker Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd <BHEL.NS> surged 2.4 percent. Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> gained 3.1 percent after the company and its partners in a gas block said on Saturday they were taking the Indian government to arbitration seeking implementation of higher gas prices. [ID:nI8N0ND00A] However, United Spirits Ltd <UNSP.NS> fell 2.8 percent after it agreed to sell its Whyte & Mackay scotch whisky unit to Emperador Inc <EMP.PS> in a 430 million pound ($729 million) deal, a valuation that was seen as lower than estimates by some analysts.
