May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V's [BABI.UL] proposed Euro senior unsecured notes an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)'. The notes will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by India's Bharti Airtel Limited <BRTI.NS> (Bharti; BBB-/Stable) and are therefore rated at the same level as Bharti's foreign-currency senior  unsecured rating of 'BBB-'. The final rating of the proposed notes is contingent  upon the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. Bharti will use the entire proceeds of the notes to refinance its existing debt.  The terms and conditions of the proposed bond are identical to Bharti's existing  guaranteed bonds of USD1.5bn due 2023, EUR1.5bn due 2018 and CHF350m due 2020.  The notes will rank pari passu with the issuer's existing and future senior  unsecured indebtedness. The announcement of these proposed notes follows an  earlier announcement today of proposed US dollar notes to which Fitch has  already assigned an expected rating of 'BBB-(EXP)'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Low Ratings Headroom: Bharti's 'BBB-' ratings would not be able to withstand  significant debt-funded acquisitions or higher-than-expected regulatory costs as  its funds flow from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage will be around  2.3x-2.5x for the financial year ending March 2015 (FY14: 2.5x, excluding unpaid  spectrum costs) - close to 2.5x, the level above which Fitch may consider  negative rating action. Nevertheless, Fitch expects Bharti to generate at least  INR35bn-40bn (USD580m-670m) in free cash flow (FCF) - despite higher  capex/revenue of 18%-19% - as competition eases in its Indian operations and  margins stabilise in its African operations.  Resilient Indian Profitability: We expect FY15 EBITDA margin to be stable at  31%-32% (FY14: 32.3%) as the top four Indian telcos increase voice realisation  per minute by reducing discounts and free minutes. The February 2014 spectrum  auctions should hasten industry consolidation, strengthen tariffs and reduce  regulatory risks. In the medium term, we expect the bottom six telcos to exit  the industry as they lack sufficient spectrum and financial resources to remain  viable. During FY14, Bharti's leverage improved mainly due to higher EBITDA  margin at its Indian operations, which increased to 35.7% from 32.5%. African Operations Continue to Struggle: We expect Bharti to continue to  struggle to improve its African EBITDA margin (FY13-14: 26%) as a low usage  elasticity, high cost structure and largely on-net voice traffic favour larger  incumbent operators. Bharti, however, has gained ground and is now the  second-largest operator by subscribers in Nigeria, which accounts for about a  third of its African revenue and EBITDA. Profitability will rise only gradually  as usage grows and the tariff differential between off-net and on-net calls  narrows following a cut in mobile termination rates in some African markets.  Capex Could Surprise: FY15-FY16 capex could rise more than Bharti's guidance of  USD2bn-2.2bn (15%-16% of revenue) because fast-growing data services may need  additional investment and African capex could rise as its peers invest more.  During FY14, Bharti invested 20.9% of its revenue, including INR110bn in capex  and INR55bn in spectrum acquisitions. Acquisitive Nature: Bharti's credit profile is exposed to the risk of further  spectrum-led and expansionary acquisitions in India and Africa. The equity  injection of USD1.3bn from Qatar Foundation Endowment in FY14 was used on  acquisitions - two in Africa and one in Mumbai - and to offset increased debt on  consolidation of Qualcomm's <QCOM.O> subsidiaries holding 2300MHz spectrum in four Indian  zones. However, we expect Bharti to follow its stated strategy to repay debt and  keep its leverage below 2.5x. Solid Access to Capital: Bharti will need to refinance a part of its short-term  debt as its cash and equivalents of INR149bn (USD2.5bn) at end-March 2014, fell  short of the INR209bn (USD3.5bn) of debt maturing in the subsequent 12 months.  Its access to capital is adequate as demonstrated in FY14 when it tapped capital  markets four times and raised an aggregate of USD2.3bn. Bharti remains exposed  to depreciation in the Indian rupee as it holds over 80% of its debt in  non-rupee currencies. During FY14, its leverage was negatively affected because  the rupee depreciated by more than 10%.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could individually or collectively lead to  negative rating actions include - A higher-than-expected regulatory charge or M&A activity resulting in  FFO-adjusted net leverage remaining above 2.5x on a sustained basis. - A downgrade of India's 'BBB-' Country Ceiling - Negative free cash flows on a sustained basis.
