TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks slipped on Monday as worries about the Ukraine crisis curbed investors' appetite for risk, although companies that have issued upbeat earnings forecasts, such as Olympus Corp <7733.T>, attracted buying.

The benchmark Nikkei <.N225> stock average ended 0.4 percent lower at 14,149.52.
