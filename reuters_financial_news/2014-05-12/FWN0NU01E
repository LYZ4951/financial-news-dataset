LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Georgian lender TBC Bank is to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange <LSE.L> in the second quarter, it said on Monday.

The company said the market flotation will comprise an offering of global depository receipts (GDRs) and it aims to raise around $100 million in primary capital.   It plans to use the proceeds to fuel lending to both retail retail customers and small and medium-sized businesses.
