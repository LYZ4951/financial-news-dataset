OSLO, May 12 (Reuters) - Norwegian property developer OBOS offered 15 crowns a share for house builder BWG Homes <BWG.OL> on Monday, valuing the firm at two billion crowns ($338.06 million), a 28 percent premium on the stock's closing price on Friday.

OBOS, which owned 32.99 before the bid, also secured pre-acceptance for another 26.7 percent, controling 56.99 percent of BWG Homes shares, it said in a statement. BWG Homes develops, builds and sells homes in the Nordics and delivers around 2,000 units per year. It had turnover of 3.9 billion crowns in 2013.  OBOS is the largest Nordic cooperative building association and is owned by its 340,000 members, most of them in the Oslo area.  BWG Homes shares rose 25.5 percent to 14.75 crowns, just below the 15 crown per share offer, indicating that the market did not expect a higher bid. "I believe it's a done deal," analyst Mats A. Holtekjoelen at Pareto Securities said.   "Since OBOS already has 32.99 percent (one-third), it takes a lot for a competitor to make a higher bid," Holtekjoelen said. BWG Homes competitor Selvaag Bolig <SBOO.OL> said it has no plans for a competing bid. "No, it does not fit in to our strategy since we are building in the cities while they are building outside the cities", Selvaag Bolig Chief Executive Baard Schuman said. "The Norwegian housing market is very fragmented and the concentration will not be too big", Schumann said. The BWG Homes board has not made a recommendation on the bid but expects an opinion one week before the bid runs out, at the latest, Chairman Roar Engeland said. BWG Homes has retained law firm Thommessen as its legal advisor and will also pick a broker to make a "fairness opinion" of the company. OBOS is using SEB Corporate Finance as financial adviser while Advokatfirmaet Selmer is acting as its legal adviser. OBOS said the bid is conditional of acceptance of at least two thirds of the shares in BWG Homes and clearance from the Norwegian Competition Authority.
