MILAN, May 12 (Reuters) - Italy's bailed-out bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> expects to meet a February 2015 deadline to fully pay back 29 billion euros ($40 billion) in cheap loans it took from the European Central Bank, according to slides posted on its website.

The bank had paid back 5 billion euros at the end of April. Its chief financial officer, Bernardo Mingrone, said the lender would put in a request to reimburse another 2 billion euros "in the next few days". According to the slides, the bank expects its exposure to the so-called LTRO loans to fall to 14 billion euros by end December this year.
