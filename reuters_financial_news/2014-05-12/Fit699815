May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Porsche Financial Auto Securitizaton Trust 2014-1 (PFAST 2014-1):  --$144,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf'; --$138,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$138,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$68,300,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS  Strong Collateral Quality: PFAST 2014-1 has strong credit quality with a  weighted average (WA) FICO score of 781, 64.3% new vehicles and WA seasoning of  16.7 months. Porsche vehicles total 88%, and 2014-1 includes Bentley (10%) and  Lamborghini (2%) vehicles, the first time these brands are included in a PFAST  pool. Adequate Credit Enhancement: PFAST 2014-1 is a sequential-pay structure. Initial  hard credit enhancement (CE) totals 2.75% (2.50% overcollateralization [OC] and  0.25% reserve [both of the initial adjusted pool balance]), down versus 2011-1.  Annual excess spread totals 2.73%. Under Fitch's analysis, the structure is able  to support stressed losses commensurate with the expected ratings.  Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: PFS' portfolio and securitization  is stable with low delinquencies and losses over the past three years.  Performance has been supported by the improving U.S. economic recovery and  stable used vehicle values. Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch deems PFS an adequate  originator, underwriter and servicer to service 2014-1, as evidenced by its  historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and loss experience and  securitization performance. Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide  that a bankruptcy of PFS would not impair the timeliness of payments on the  securities.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on  defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. In  turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on the notes. Fitch  evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of PFAST 2014-1  to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found  that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In  fact, they could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under  Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience  downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case  loss) scenario.
