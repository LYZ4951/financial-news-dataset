BOSTON, May 12 (Reuters) - William Ackman plans to reach out to other Allergan <AGN.N> shareholders after the Botox-maker on Monday rebuffed a bid to be bought by the billionaire investor and Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.TO>.

In a regulatory filing on Monday, Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management said that it has requested a complete list of holders of record in Allergan in order to "communicate with fellow stockholders of the Company."
