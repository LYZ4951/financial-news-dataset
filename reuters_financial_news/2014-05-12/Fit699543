May 12 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Parvest Equity Best Selection  Euro, a fund managed by BNP Paribas Investment Partners (BNPP IP), a 'Strong'  Fund Quality Rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'Strong' rating reflects the fund's highly documented investment approach,  which is supported by in-depth research and portfolio management resources and  has demonstrated a solid track record. In Fitch's view, the fund is  differentiated from its peers by the depth of its research, its industry focus,  its peer decision- making process and its risk discipline.   FUND PRESENTATION Parvest Equity Best Selection Euro is a sub-fund of the Parvest Luxembourg  SICAV. Launched in May 2004, it is a long-only European equities fund of  EUR1.02bn as at 30 April 2014.  INVESTMENT PROCESS The fund's active, long-term investment approach with a three- to five-year  holding period is based on bottom-up fundamental stock-picking. The fund is  fully invested, and has a quality mid- to large-cap growth bias but no sector  bias. BNPP IP's proprietary research differentiates itself from peers by its industry  focus, its depth of analysis and a degree of formalisation. Analysts'  recommendations are challenged in a peer-review process. Investment decisions  are then made by the whole European equity team through consensus. Risk  budgeting drives portfolio construction: active share (i.e. the portion of the  portfolio that is not benchmark replication) is kept above 70%. Stock-specific  factors are maintained at above 50% of total risk. Each source of common risk  factors is capped at 10% of total risk.   RESOURCES The stable European equity team consists of 10 portfolio managers  (PMs)/analysts, who each have 20 years' experience on average. In addition to  BNPP IP's deep, shared risk management resources, the team benefits from a  dedicated risk manager, making full use of third-party equity risk analytics.  TRACK RECORD The fund has demonstrated a long-term, strong, consistent risk-adjusted  performance, outperforming its category and benchmark (MSCI EMU) by 28.7% and  18.7% respectively over five years. In 2013 and year-to-date, the fund has  suffered from its growth quality bias, as value stocks outperformed.  FUND MANAGER BNPP IP (rated 'Highest Standards' by Fitch) is the asset management arm of BNP  Paribas banking group (A+/Stable/F1). BNPPIP had EUR10.6bn of European equities  under management at end-March 2014.   RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the investment or operational  processes or resources dedicated to the fund. A material adverse deviation from  Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver could result in a downgrade of the  rating. For example, this may be manifested in significant structural  deterioration in the fund's performance. Fitch sees limited key person  dependency in the team, so the departure of a PM is unlikely to affect the  rating.  Conversely, an upgrade could result from demonstrated outperformance relative to  peers and the benchmark in a sustained period of unfavourable market conditions,  such as that characterised by the outperformance of low-quality, value stocks.   Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings combine Fitch's experience in qualitative fund  analysis with rankings and performance data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters  company. Fitch's Fund Quality Ratings offer an independent, forward-looking  assessment of a fund's key performance and risk attributes and consistency of  longer-term returns, relative to peer group or benchmarks. The ratings focus on  the fund manager's investment process, key fund performance drivers, risk  management, and the quality of the fund's operational infrastructure.
