MUMBAI, May 12 (Reuters) - Reliance Industries Ltd gained as much as 4.2 percent to its highest since April 2011 after the company and its partners in a gas block said on Saturday they were taking the Indian government to arbitration seeking implementation of higher gas prices.

Reliance <RELI.NS> and its partners BP Plc <BP.L> and Niko Resources <NKO.TO> issued the notice of arbitration to the government on May 9, the three companies said in a joint statement. [ID:nL3N0NW096]
