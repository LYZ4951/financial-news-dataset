PARIS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - European stocks rose in early trading on Wednesday, with Nordic telecom operators Telenor <TEL.OL> and TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST> rallying after agreeing to merge their Danish operations.

Shares in Telenor rose 2.3 percent while TeliaSonera added 1.5 percent after unveiling their join-venture deal. The companies hope to save 800 million Danish crowns ($133 million) annually in efficiency gains. [ID:nFWN0TM01J]
