LAGOS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria's naira <NGN=D1> firmed sharply for the second day on Wednesday, after the central bank increased dollar sales to commercial lenders in the interbank market, dealers said.

Though the currency is still below the bank's new target range, it gained more than 2 percent to 179.10 naira in volatile trades.
