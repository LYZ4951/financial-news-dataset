NICOSIA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Cypriot lender Hellenic Bank <HBNK.CY> anticipates a listing of its shares on the Athens Stock Exchange in early 2015, its chairwoman said on Wednesday, giving the bank access to additional market liquidity.

"I would say that within, probably, the first couple of months of 2015 that would be possible," Irena Georgiadou told Reuters.
