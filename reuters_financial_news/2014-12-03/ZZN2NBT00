HONG KONG, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares reversed earlier gains and finished down on Wednesday as money flowed into the bullish mainland markets, analysts said.

Share prices in Hong Kong have lagged those in China since the launch of the cross border trading scheme between the two cities and as investors await further price consolidation. Analysts said the latest update from the Occupy Central protest movement had limited impact on investor sentiment. The founders of the movement urged the protesters to go home on Tuesday amid fears of violence.
