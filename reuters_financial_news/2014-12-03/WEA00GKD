COPENHAGEN, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The main shareholders in Danish business services firm ISS <ISS.CO> sold 13.5 percent of the company's existing stock for 4.1 billion Danish crowns ($682 million), the company said on Wednesday.

The shareholders, private equity firm EQT <EQT.N> and funds advised by Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, had planned to sell 18.6 million shares in a book-building process, but decided later on Tuesday to increase this to 25 million shares. At a price of 162 Danish crowns each, the shares in the placement were sold at a 4 percent discount to Tuesday's closing price of 169.2 crowns per share.
