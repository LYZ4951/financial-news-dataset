NEW DELHI, Dec 3 (Reuters) - India has eased foreign direct investment rules for the construction sector, the government said in a statement on Wednesday, in a move to attract more money into the country to build new hotels, housing and townships.

Under the new rules, foreign investment is now allowed in projects with a minimum built area of 20,000 square metres, down from a previous 50,000 threshold. The minimum capital investment by foreign companies has been halved to $5 million, the statement said.
