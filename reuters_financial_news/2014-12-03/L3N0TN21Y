HONG KONG, Dec 3 (Reuters) -    ** China developer Kaisa Property <1638.HK> requests a trading halt on its shares after they fall 6.4 percent on Tuesday to close at HK$2.63. The drop comes amid media reports that government authorities have locked Kaisa's apartment sales.

** Bonds fall by about 5 cents on the dollar on Wednesday after the previous day's 2 point drop, on average. The bonds had recovered from lows on Tuesday on speculation the sale restrictions had been removed. Bonds due 2020 <XS087158047=TE> are trading at 94/96 cents on the dollar. They were trading at around 104/105 before reports of sale restrictions on Tuesday. ** Kaisa could not immediately be reached for comment.  ** "The market is waiting for the company to make a formal statement. The sale restriction could be due to incomplete documentation or in the worst case scenario there could be a link to anti-corruption investigation," said a bond trader in Hong Kong. ** "It is our understanding that the authority "lock" means the housing developer is in a restricted state or there exists irregularities," said a note from Lucror Analytics, an independent credit research firm. ** Chinese developers are under intense pressure, with new home prices dropping for a seventh consecutive month in November from the previous month, a survey by the China Real Estate Index System (CREIS) showed. This comes at a time when the economy is growing at its slowest clip since the 2008 global financial crisis.
