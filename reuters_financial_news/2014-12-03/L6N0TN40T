WARSAW, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Following are comments from Polish central bank governor Marek Belka on Wednesday after the bank left the key interest rate unchanged at 2.00 percent.

The central bank st7atement after the decision is available at http://www.nbp.pl/polityka_pieniezna/dokumenty/files/rpp_2014_12_03.pdf   ON INFLATION We've assumed in the strategy that the CPI target is executed in a flexible way, which means that if the CPI falls not because of internal factors, we don't need to react frantically. We've never had such a deflation which was expected to last only for some several summer months, then maybe until the end of the year, and now we talk about February, maybe about March. There is an uncertainty related to the consequences of extended deflation, secondly we have uncertainty related to our lack of familiarity with ultra low rates.  ON GDP GROWTH For sure in the last month we've received information that, albeit insignificantly, improve Poland's economic prospects. For me the most important thing is the GDP structure signalled by the statistics office. We can't be sure that GDP growth will accelerate now. We expect that GDP will be growing in the fourth quarter at a pace close to (the third quarter), maybe a little bit lower, but this is just pure guesswork. I would be very happy if the Polish economy would only accelerate. But we don't know it for sure. We expect, lets say, some stabilization, this is the optimistic option. But if it turns out that the situation around us is not so good, that it is deteriorating, we could expect slowdown in growth.  ON RATES If the MPC didn't cut rates at the previous meeting, pointing to uncertainty regarding the real sphere, then today it was confirmed in this belief to some extent. I think that nothing wrong happened to the economy (as a result of not cutting rates on Wednesday).
