SAO PAULO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Itaú BBA SA, the largest Brazilian investment bank by revenue, named Roderick Greenlees to become global head of investment banking as the shop seeks to grow its presence across Latin America.

Greenlees, who was a managing director at Itaú BBA's investment-banking division, will start in January, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters. He replaces Fernando Iunes, who will become a senior advisor for new business at the São Paulo-based bank. The appointment of Greenlees comes days after Mexico's government granted the wholesale and investment bank controlled by Itaú Unibanco Holding SA <ITUB4.SA> permission to open a broker-dealer in the country. Itaú Unibanco is Latin America's largest lender by market value. Itaú BBA's press office did not have an immediate comment on the job changes.
