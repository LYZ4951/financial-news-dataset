MOSCOW, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Russian consumer credit group TCS <TCSq.L> said on Wednesday its board had adopted a new dividend policy and declared an interim dividend of $0.303 per ordinary share, the same amount for one global depositary receipt.

TCS also said the total dividend payment would reach $55 million. The dividend is expected to be paid on Dec. 17.  "Payments of dividends would be made provided that the management can reasonably anticipate that TCS Bank's N1 capital adequacy ratio would remain ... at or above 14 percent," the bank said in a statement.  TCS, founded by Russian entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, focuses on Russia's regions, where it delivers credit cards by courier.
