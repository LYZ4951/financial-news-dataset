BANGKOK, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets ended flat to weaker on Wednesday, with Malaysia's key stock index sliding to a near 15-month closing low amid foreign outflows and a fall in the ringgit due to concerns over the impact of lower crude prices.

Kuala Lumpur's composite index <.KLSE> fell 1.6 percent to 1,758.15, the lowest close since September 2013. The ringgit <MYR=MY> lost as much as 0.5 percent to 3.4420 per dollar, its weakest since February 2010. [ID:nL3N0TN181] Malaysia is a net oil exporter and major palm oil producer. Foreign investors sold shares worth a net 201 million ringgit ($58.43 million), their sixth straight session of net selling, a Malaysian bourse statement said. Brent held above $70 a barrel on Wednesday, recovering slightly from losses in the prior session as a turbulent market struggled to find a price floor. [O/R] Among underperformers, Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> ended 0.19 percent lower after a rally over the past five sessions when the falling oil price helped ease concerns about fiscal and trade deficit of Indonesia.
