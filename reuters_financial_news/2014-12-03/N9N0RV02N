SAO PAULO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Activity in Brazil's services sector fell for the second straight month in November as higher inflation and a fragile economic outlook continued to weigh after a sharp October slowdown.

HSBC's Purchasing Managers Index for Brazilian Services <BRPMIS=ECI> edged up on a seasonally adjusted basis to 48.5 in November, extending contraction after hitting a 26-month low of 48.2 in October. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. The weak services sector combined with an ongoing slump in manufacturing activity to drag HSBC's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI> for the country to 48.1 in November, the lowest in more than five years, down from 48.4 in October. The weak leading indicator underscores concerns that Brazil's economy may have only briefly pulled out of recession in the third quarter due to short-lived government spending, but the underlying business climate remains grim. [ID:nL2N0TI0BZ] One of the few silver linings of the slowdown in October, a rare drop in prices, vanished in November as a weaker local currency and higher fuel costs led services firms to hike prices at the fastest pace in more than six years. Brazil's central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates for a second straight meeting later on Wednesday, tightening its grip on inflation but weighing further on sluggish economic growth.
