LAGOS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria's foreign reserves fell to a six-month low of $36.7 billion by Dec. 1, down 4.5 percent from the previous month as the central bank stepped up its defence of the naira <NGN=D1> currency, figures on the bank's website showed.

The reserves <NGFXR=ECI> of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer stood at the same level as in June this year and were down from $38.45 billion on Nov. 2, the data showed on Wednesday.
