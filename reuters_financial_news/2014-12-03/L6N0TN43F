LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Real-estate firms Barratt Developments <BDEV.L> and Taylor Wimpey <TW.L> will join Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> equity index, replacing two stocks hit by the recent sell-off in commodities, the London Stock Exchange said.

Barratt and Taylor Wimpey will replace energy services company Petrofac <PFC.L> and engineer IMI <IMI.L>. The two homebuilders' shares have gained 30 percent and 20 percent respectively this year on the back of Britain's rising property market. Petrofac and IMI will join the FTSE 250 <.FTMC> index.
