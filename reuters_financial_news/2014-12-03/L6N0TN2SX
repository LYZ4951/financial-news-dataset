DUBAI, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Marafiq, a utility services provider to two industrial cities in Saudi Arabia, has signed a 2.5 billion riyal ($666.1 million) Islamic loan, which will partly be used to expand capacities in its existing projects, it said in a statement on Wednesday.

The new long-term facility was arranged by HSBC's <HSBA.L> Saudi Arabian arm, the statement said, without revealing the tenor and pricing of the transaction. The company, which counts Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> and Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL] as shareholders, will use the murabaha-structured facility for capacity expansion plans in different projects located in Jubail and Yanbu. A murabaha is a cost-plus-profit arrangement which is one of the most popular formats for structuring Islamic loans. Al Rajhi Bank <1120.SE>, National Commercial Bank <1180.SE>, Riyad Bank <1010.SE>, Samba Financial Group <1090.SE> and Saudi British Bank <1060.SE> joined the facility, the statement said.
