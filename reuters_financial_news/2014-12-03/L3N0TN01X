SINGAPORE, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX) <SGXL.SI> said securities market trading had been delayed due to a software problem and would start at 12:30 p.m. (0430 GMT) on Wednesday, a month after a power failure suspended trading in stocks and derivatives for hours.

It said the delayed opening was to enable member firms to complete client position reconciliations and rectify errors in end-of-day processing for Dec. 1 on the securities client-accounting system hosted by SGX on behalf of dealers.
