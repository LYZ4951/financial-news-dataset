LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - British wealth manager Brewin Dolphin <BRW.L> on Wednesday posted a fall in full-year pretax profit of 70 percent to 8.6 million pounds($13.5 million), hit by one-off costs including that from a failed roll-out of new software.

Adjusted for that, redundancy costs and other provisions, pretax profit was up 16 percent to 60.2 million pounds, it said in a statement. The company posted a final dividend down 24 percent at 6.25 pence a share, and as a result its total dividend dividend for the year was up 15 percent to 9.9 pence a share.
