LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Czech economy should benefit from quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, the head of the Czech central bank said on Wednesday, and he urged people not to overplay the economic threat of Russia's tensions with the West.

Miroslav Singer said the threat of deflation in the euro zone and the Russia-Ukraine conflict were the big risks for the Czech economy next year. "We are still worried about the euro zone," Singer told Reuters at a Russian banking conference. "It is a major external risk." However, "the current weakening of the euro exchange rate mitigates the risk in a significant manner," by helping the German car makers and manufacturers that influence the Czech economy. The Czech central bank has been weakening its currency since 2012. ECB quantitative easing -- buying government bonds and in effect printing money to stimulate the economy -- could push up the crown <EURCZK=>. But currency markets have generally assumed what lifts or depresses the euro does the same to currencies in central and eastern Europe. "We don't have any pressure on the crown" Singer said. "We have celebrated a year of not being on the market" to influence the crown's exchange rate. "The U.S. is growing out of problems and will probably need higher interest in the foreseeable future while Europe's economy is still at the bottom of the cycle. So the currency market reflects this and it reflects that the ECB must do something. That is fine with me." He backed ECB quantitative easing, or QE, to reach the more troubled parts of the euro zone, where record low interest rates aren't being fully felt. "We are talking about impaired financial channels ... but I believe the ECB is aware of it and is designing QE in such a way that it should have some effects also on the weaker parts."  GEOPOLITICAL RISK  Tensions between Russia and the West may undermine economic confidence in Europe but would not have a major economic impact, Singer said. Russia should now reshape its economy, he said. The rouble has dropped nearly 40 percent since June, partly on the Ukraine unrest but mainly following a drop in the price of oil. That is "not pleasant for Russia. But in the longer run it's an opportunity for Russia to change the economy and be much less commodity-dependent." Meanwhile, the effects of ECB stimulus and planned government measures should keep the Czech economy on an even keel. "I expect us to be sort of stable, maybe with a growth rate of between 2 and 3 percent.
