TOKYO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - A Japanese government spokesman said on Wednesday he does not think Moody's Investors Service's ratings downgrade of the nation's sovereign debt and banks will affect financial institutions.

"I don't think there is a problem at all in the soundness of Japanese financial institutions at the moment and I don't think a ratings cut on sovereign debt will affect this soundness significantly, either," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko told a news conference.
