MOSCOW, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is intervening on the currency market again to defend the rouble, three traders told Reuters following sharp swings in the rouble's exchange rate on Wednesday.

"Without doubt, the central bank is selling (foreign currency). The whole question is what volumes it is limiting itself too," said a trader at a large Western bank in Moscow.
