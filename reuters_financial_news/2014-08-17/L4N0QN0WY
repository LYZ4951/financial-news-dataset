SYDNEY, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) <CBA.AX>, the country's No.1 lender by market value, said on Monday that it will raise A$2 billion ($1.86 billion) through subordinated, unsecured notes to help fund its business.

The funds raised will also help CBA boost its Tier-I capital ratio, it said. At the end of June, that ratio was at 9.3 percent. The offer opens on Aug. 26 and closes on Sept. 19.
