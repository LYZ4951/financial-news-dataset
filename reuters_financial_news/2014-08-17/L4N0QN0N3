MELBOURNE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open a touch higher on Monday, but will mostly take their cue from earnings from a range of companies, led by National Australia Bank, rail operator Aurizon Holdings and top gold miner Newcrest Mining.

* Others reporting results on Monday include real estate investment trust Stockland Group, gloves and condoms maker Ansell and New Zealand's Contact Energy.  * Share price index futures rose 0.2 percent to 5,516.0, holding at a discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO>. The benchmark rose 0.3 percent on Friday, ending the week up 2.4 percent. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> slipped 1.84 points to 5,076.2 in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended mixed on Friday, paring an earlier selloff sparked by reports of Ukraine shelling a Russian armored column. * The price of copper edged higher on Friday as some investors bought back short positions to take profits ahead of the weekend. Gains were capped as a gloomy outlook for growth in top metals consumer China raised concerns about demand.   ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2231 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1955.06 -0.01%-0.120 USD/JPY <JPY=>   102.39   0.05% 0.050 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.3415  -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1301.71 -0.21%-2.680 US CRUDE<CLc1>   96.9-0.46%-0.450 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16662.91-0.30%-50.67 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  153.63   0.00%  0.00 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St ends mixed, recovers from Ukraine-driven slide  [.N]   * Oil jumps after Ukraine says hit Russian force [O/R]   * Gold cuts losses on renewed Russia-Ukraine tensions   [GOL/]   * Copper at lowest level since June on China worries   [MET/L]  For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian  newspapers, double click on [PRESS/AUB] DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
