PARIS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The main risk to European governments is if markets were to decide their debt burdens had become unmanageable, ECB governing council member Christian Noyer said Tuesday, adding central bank purchases of government debt would be complicated in Europe.

"The principle risk for European governments is that at some point the markets decide that the sustainability of their debt is no longer ensured," Noyer, who is also governor of the Bank of France, said at the French Senate.
