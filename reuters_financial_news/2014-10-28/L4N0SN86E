Oct 28 (Reuters) - New British banking venture Atom is tapping investors to raise about 20 million pounds ($32.27 million) ahead of its planned launch next year, the Sky News reported late Tuesday.

Atom, which plans to offer its services online and have no physical branches, is expected to raise the current round of funding from existing and new shareholders, the website said.
