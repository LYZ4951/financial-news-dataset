NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Chicago-based broker-dealer HighTower Advisors LLC said on Tuesday it added two consultants to a retirement consulting practice on HighTower's Network channel, the firm's branch for  businesses that remain independently-owned.

Charlie Vieth and Steve Zients joined Fiduciary Plan Advisers at HighTower, a Baltimore-based group that provides consulting on employer-sponsored retirement plans, like 401(k)s, according to the group's website. Vieth and Zients joined from Act2 Retirement Consulting, the retirement consulting practice they founded after both left T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services where Vieth was president and Zients was executive vice president for client service, according to Act2's LinkedIn company page.
