HONG KONG, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Standard Chartered Plc <STAN.L> said operating profit for the third quarter fell 16 percent, as the Asia-focused bank grappled with rising costs from the restructuring of its South Korean business and an increase in impaired loans.

Operating profit for the July-September quarter fell to $1.5 billion from $1.8 billion in the same period a year ago. StanChart <2888.HK> has said it expects profits to fall in 2014 for a second straight year, as the lender faces a number of challenges including a slowdown in growth in many of its core emerging markets and weak trading activity.
