COPENHAGEN, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Sydbank <SYDB.CO> reported third-quarter pretax profits above forecast on Tuesday and reiterated its profit guidance for the year, but warned of a drop in earnings among its farm customers this year and next year as a result of Russia's trade embargo.

The bank, Denmark's third-biggest by market capitalisation, said pretax profit rose more than threefold to 418 million Danish crowns (71.4 million), above the mean forecast of 354 million crowns in a Reuters poll of analysts. [ID:nL6N0SI1ZG] The jump in profit was mainly due to lower impairment charges on loans, while higher trading income also made a contribution. "Third-quarter performance shows that Sydbank's plan to increase profitability is working. Costs are falling, income is growing and at the same time credit quality is improving," chief executive Karen Frosig said in a statement. Sydbank continues to project rising core income and trading income for the full-year and guidance for impairment charges are still between 700 million and 800 million crowns for 2014. Management expects clients within the agricultural sector to be affected by a decline in milk and pork prices due to Russia's embargo on many products from the EU, growth in global food production as well as significantly lower demand from China. "Given the current settlement prices we project considerably lower earnings in the agricultural sector in 2015 than in 2013 and 2014 where earnings in the sector were relatively high," the bank said. If the prices for farmers' products stay unchanged in 2015, Sydbank expects an average full-time farm to record zero profit for the year, against a profit of 750,000 crowns in 2013 and projected earnings of 200,000 crowns in 2014.
