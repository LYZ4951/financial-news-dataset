MILAN, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Italy's Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> is not interested in any merger and acquisition operations, Chief Executive Alberto Nagel said on Tuesday.

In a conference call with analysts Nagel said the Italian banking system would see a process of consolidation at a domestic level over the next 18 months. Only after that would there be M&A activity across Europe, he added.
