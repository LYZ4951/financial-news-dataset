PARIS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Building materials groups Holcim <HOLN.VX> and Lafarge <LAFP.PA> said on Tuesday they had formally notified the European Commission of their merger plan.

The move kicks off official scrutiny in Europe of a deal that is sure to result in multi-billion dollar disposals to secure regulators approval in some 15 countries worldwide. In a statement, the partners who plan to create the world's biggest cement group with $44 billion in annual sales also said they had adjusted slightly their disposals plan. The pair said they plan to keep Lafarge's Mannersdorf plant in Austria, and divest all of Holcim's assets in Slovakia.
