MADRID, Oct. 28 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell <SABE.MC> is expected to report on Thursday a 40 percent rise in nine-month net profit from a year ago, thanks to improving margins and a fall in its bad loans ratio as the country's economic recovery feeds through to banks.

Six analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast average net profit for the January to September period of 261 million euros. In the third quarter alone, net profit is seen up 45.6 percent to 91.7 million euros from 63 million in the same quarter last year. Following are the results of the survey in simple averages and millions of euros.
