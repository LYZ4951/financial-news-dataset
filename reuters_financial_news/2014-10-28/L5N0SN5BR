LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - French cable telecoms operator Numericable <NUME.PA> is to launch a 4.7 billion-euro ($6 billion) capital hike on Wednesday to finance its takeover of Vivendi's <VIV.PA> SFR mobile network operator, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The SFR deal, which involves 13.5 billion euros in cash, a 20 percent stake in the combined entity for Vivendi and a potential milestone payment, received conditional approval from France's competition authority on Monday. [ID:nL5N0SM2OM] Numericable, controlled by billionaire Patrick Drahi, beat out rival Bouygues <BOUY.PA> to acquire SFR after month-long bidding war.
