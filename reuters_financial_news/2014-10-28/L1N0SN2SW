NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Jim Chanos, who has a long-running bet against China, said that country's credit bubble was starting to cause capital outflows to accelerate, a problem that may ultimately weaken the nation's yuan currency.

The prominent short seller pointed to overbuilding in residential housing in Chin, and the increasing cost of building gaming properties in nearby Macau as evidence that the bubble was getting worse.  He believes investors are starting to take notice.
