STOCKHOLM, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Sweden's government is looking at ways to encourage mortgage borrowers to pay off their loans faster to ease worries about high levels of household debt, the country's deputy finance minister said on Tuesday.

"Sweden is a bit of an outlier in terms of our amortisation culture when you compare, for example with our Nordic neighbours like Finland," Deputy Finance Minister Per Bolund told reporters. "Then it's a question of moving at a reasonable pace so that you don't create uncertainty." He said the government was looking at wide range of measures to cool down the housing market.
