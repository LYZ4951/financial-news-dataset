MOSCOW, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Megafon <MFON.MM> <MFONq.L>, Russia's No.2 mobile operator, is expected to report an 18 percent fall in third-quarter net profit, due to a foreign exchange loss and higher debt costs, a Reuters poll of 13 banks and brokerages showed on Tuesday.

Analysts on average forecast net profit of 12.6 billion roubles ($296.8 million) in results due on Thursday, down from 15.3 billion roubles in the third quarter of 2013.  J.P. Morgan expects a 4.4-billion-rouble, non-cash forex loss, stemming from the rouble's slide against the dollar, and net profit of 12 billion roubles, its analysts said in a note. Raiffeisenbank also expects higher interest expenses due to an increase in debt load to hit the earnings. Revenue is seen rising 4.4 percent on average to around 81 billion roubles, albeit slowing from previous quarters due to an outflow of subscribers who had bought contracts during the 2014 Winter Olympics for which Megafon was the official mobile operator, as well as adverse economic conditions. However, the company is expected to demonstrate margin resilience, suggesting that the risk to its dividend should not be significant, Raiffeisenbank's Sergei Libin said. Following is a summary of forecasts for Megafon's results (figures in millions of roubles, unless otherwise stated):
