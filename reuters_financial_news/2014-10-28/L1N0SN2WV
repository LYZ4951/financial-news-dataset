SAO PAULO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Profit at Cielo SA <CIEL3.SA> slightly beat estimates in the third quarter as robust prepayment revenue at Brazil's largest card payment processor helped offset steady transaction volumes and higher expenses.

The Barueri, Brazil-based company earned 820.51 million reais ($333 million) in the July-through-September period, slightly above the average profit estimate of 808 million reais in a Reuters poll of eight analysts.  Profit rose 3.0 percent and 18.7 percent on a quarterly and annual bases, respectively, the company said in a securities filing on Tuesday. Management plans to discuss results in a conference call early on Wednesday.
