PARIS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Tuesday, reversing the previous session's dip as better-than-expected results from a number of blue-chips including pharma group Novartis <NOVN.VX> and bank UBS <UBSN.VX> helped lift sentiment.

At 0803 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.6 percent at 1,313.05 points, with UBS up 1.9 percent and Novartis up 1.7 percent.
