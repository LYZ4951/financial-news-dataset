DUBAI/ABU DHABI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD>, the United Arab Emirates' largest lender, expects loan growth to be in the "high single digits" in the coming months, its chief executive said.

"If we see 4 percent GDP growth, we double that for loan growth so between 7 to 9 percent (for the industry). We won't be double digits but will be high single digits year on year," Alex Thursby said in a conference call on Tuesday. He was speaking after the bank reported a 32 percent rise in third-quarter net profit. [ID:nL5N0SN2M0]
