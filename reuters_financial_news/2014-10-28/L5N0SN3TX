WARSAW, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Bank Zachodni WBK <BZW.WA>, part of Spanish bank Santander <SAN.MC>, is expected to post a drop in third-quarter net profit due to costs related to its merger with smaller peer Santander Consumer Bank (SCB), a Reuters survey showed on Tuesday.

The bank, a member of the Warsaw bourse's main equity index WIG20 [.WIG20], is expected to report a 7 percent year-on-year decline in net profit to 500 million zlotys ($150 million), according to the average of estimate of 10 banks and brokerages. Analysts believe BZ WBK's operating costs rose by almost 30 percent year-on-year due to the merger with Santander's smaller Polish unit specializing in consumer credits and car loans, but that they will be lower in coming quarters. BZ WBK's bad loan provisions also rose because of SCB's risk profile, but this may be offset by higher margins on its credit portfolio, analysts said.
