MILAN, Oct 28 (Reuters) - DBRS has placed the credit ratings of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> under review with negative implications after results from a pan-European health check of lenders showed it had a capital shortfall of 2.1 billion euros ($2.67 billion).

Monte dei Paschi, Italy's third-largest bank, was left badly exposed by the European Central Bank's stress tests on 130 European banks, which set strict capital thresholds to ensure the solidity of the financial system.[ID:nL5N0SL0KL] DBRS said on Tuesday it was concerned "about the pressure on management to successfully execute a further capital raise following the 5 billion euro issue in June 2014".
