PARIS, Oct 28 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not accept inflation remaining stuck below its target of close to but less than two percent, governing council member Christian Noyer said on Tuesday.

Noyer, who is also governor of the Bank of France, said that forecasts suggest that euro zone inflation would "without a doubt" stand at around only 0.6 percent by the end of the year.
