SAO PAULO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Profit at Brazilian card payment processor Cielo SA slightly recovered in the third quarter as robust prepayment revenue helped offset steady transaction volumes and higher expenses, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

The headwinds that recently weighed down Cielo's profitability intensified in the last quarter, including higher capital spending that drove costs near the ceiling of guidance.  The Barueri, Brazil-based company will release its results after markets close on Tuesday. Management plans to discuss results in a conference call early on Wednesday.  Net income should come in at an average 808 million reais ($328 million), up 9.7 percent and 16.2 percent on a quarterly and annual bases, the poll of eight analysts showed. Profit had declined in the second quarter for the first time in a year. A better-than-expected result "shouldn't be a stock driver" as economic growth keeps faltering, said Eduardo Rosman, an analyst with Grupo BTG Pactual. "There is limited room for positive surprises." The end of exclusivity agreements with merchants and market share losses to rivals including Itaú Unibanco Holding SA's <ITUB4.SA> Rede and Banco Santander Brasil SA's <SANB11.SA> GetNet are unlikely to trigger further declines in shares of Cielo, which are down 17 percent since July, analysts said.  Net revenue was expected to be up 9.7 percent to 2.02 billion reais in spite of a slight decline in debit and credit card transaction volumes. Prepayment of receivables likely fell slightly on a quarterly basis, but jumped 36 percent on an annual basis thanks to better pricing for small-sized retailers, the poll found. Expenses were likely to hit 0.76 reais per transaction, within the guidance at 0.75 reais to 0.78 reais this year, the poll found. Analysts such as Credit Suisse Securities' Victor Schabbel expect some relief in the expenses front next year. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profit known as EBITDA, was expected to rise 1.4 percent to 969 million reais from the second quarter. EBITDA likely fell to 48 percent of revenue in the third quarter, from 51.9 percent the prior quarter.  The following are forecasts on Cielo's earnings.
