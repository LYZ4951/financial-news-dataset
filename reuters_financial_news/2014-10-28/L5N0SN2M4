LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> has set aside another 900 million pounds ($1.5 billion) to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance, taking the total bill for the industry to over 23 billion pounds.

The new charge took Lloyds' total cost to cover the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) to 11.3 billion pounds, more than any other bank and close to half of the total bill for the industry. The amounts paid out to customers who bought payment protection insurance (PPI) make it the costliest mis-selling scandal in British banking history. PPI policies were supposed to protect borrowers against sickness or redundancy, but were often sold to those who would have been ineligible to claim.
