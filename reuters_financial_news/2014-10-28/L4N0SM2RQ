TOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings <8604.T> said its net third-quarter profit rose 39 percent year-on-year, beating forecasts, as by cost cuts helped offset a slight drop in retail brokerage sales.

Japan's biggest investment banking and brokerage group said its quarterly net profit rose to 53 billion yen ($492 million), beating a consensus forecast of 41 billion yen by analysts on Thomson Reuters Starmine.  Sales from its retail division, which serves individual and small corporate investors, fell 1 percent from a year ago as last year's stock market rally inspired by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic growth policies cooled off, weighing on trading volumes.  Return on equity improved to 8.4 percent from 6.4 percent a year earlier.
