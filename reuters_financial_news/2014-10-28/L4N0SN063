SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Samsung Group heir apparent Jay Y. Lee is looking to acquire small stakes in Samsung Life Insurance Co Ltd <032830.KS> and Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance Co Ltd <000810.KS>, South Korea's largest conglomerate said on Tuesday.

Lee is seeking regulatory approval to acquire a 0.1 percent stake each in Samsung Life and Samsung Fire & Marine, Samsung Group said in an email statement. He is re-investing after-tax proceeds of 25.2 billion won ($23.97 million) from selling his stake in Samsung Asset Management Co Ltd to Samsung Life earlier this year, according to the statement.  The planned stake purchases do not represent a major change in ownership structure of both insurance companies, which are already controlled by Samsung Group.  Lee has no plans to buy more shares in Samsung Life or Samsung Fire & Marine at present, Samsung Group said, without saying why he wants to make the investments.
