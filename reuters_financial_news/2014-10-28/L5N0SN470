LISBON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Portugal on Tuesday received a European Commission green light on Tuesday to set up a development bank that will support small and medium-sized firms using state aid and European funds to compensate for poor debt and equity market financing.

Such enterprises, known as SMEs, make up more than 90 percent of all companies in Portugal, which in May exited an international bailout following a severe debt crisis and recession. SMEs are generally hugely indebted and have one of the lowest own capital levels in Europe. The commission said that the creation of the development institution was in line with EU state aid rules. "In particular, the Commission found that the measure would address market failures that hamper SMEs' access to finance, without unduly distorting competition in the Single Market," it said in a statement. The government expects the Financial Institution for Development (abbreviated IFD in Portuguese) to have up to 10 billion euros at its disposal from European structural and cohesion funds by 2020. The IFD, which will open with a starting capital of 100 million euros fully subscribed by the Portuguese state, will provide SMEs with access to funding on a co-investment basis with private investors.
