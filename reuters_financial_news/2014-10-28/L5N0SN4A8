MADRID, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest lender BBVA <BBVA.MC> is expected to post a 35 percent drop in nine-month net profit on Wednesday compared to a year earlier, when earnings were boosted by one-off gains from asset sales.

BBVA is seen reporting profit for the January to September period of around 2.0 billion euros (2.54 billion US dollar), according to the averaged forecasts of six analysts surveyed by Reuters. In the third quarter alone, BBVA's net profit is expected to more than triple from a year ago to 671 million euros, as net interest income, or earnings on loans minus deposit costs, improves.  Like many of its peers, BBVA's bad debts as a percentage of total loans should also register a drop in the July-September quarter, as an economic recovery in Spain feeds through to banks. Following are the results of the survey in millions of euros and simple averages.
