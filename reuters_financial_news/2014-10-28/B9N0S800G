SHANGHAI, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Chinese shares rebounded on Tuesday, breaking a multi-day string of declines, on hopes of more reforms at the country's state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 2.1 percent at 2,337.9 points, marking its biggest daily rise since July 28, while the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings climbed 2.0 percent. Hopes of more reforms at its state-owned enterprises were fuelled by reports in official media on Tuesday that China's top train makers, China CNR <601299.SS> <6199.HK> and CSR Corp <601766.SS> <1766.HK>, were planning to merge to create an entity strong enough to compete globally.
