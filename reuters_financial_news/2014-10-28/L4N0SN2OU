SEOUL, Oct 28 (Reuters) - South Korean shares edged lower on Tuesday, with investors hesitant to take aggressive positions ahead of a two-day meeting by the U.S Federal Reserve that could yield clues on when it will start raising interest rates.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> fell 0.3 percent to close at 1,925.68 points. The South Korean won <KRW=> was slightly firmer on Tuesday, as weariness over more dovish statements from the Fed prompted market players to cut their exposure to the dollar.
