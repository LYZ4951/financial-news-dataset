HONG KONG, Oct 28 (Reuters) - China Life Insurance Co Ltd <2628.HK> <601628.SS>, the world's biggest insurer by market capitalization, said on Tuesday third-quarter net profit rose by 22 percent, driven mainly by gains on investments.

The company said in a stock exchange filing in Shanghai it had earned 9.15 billion yuan ($1.50 billion) in the quarter ended September, compared with 7.5 billion yuan a year earlier. Analysts had expected a positive set of results for China Life, after it earlier reported growth in premiums for September of 10.9 percent. China Life is part of a consortium taking a 10 billion yuan stake in state-controlled oil giant Sinopec Corp's <0386.HK> $17.5 billion retail business. [ID:nL3N0RF0CU]
