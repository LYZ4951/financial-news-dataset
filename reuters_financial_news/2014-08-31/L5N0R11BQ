MADRID, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Spain's Caixabank <CABK.MC> has agreed to buy the Spanish retail and corporate banking units of Britain's Barclays <BARC.L>, plus its wealth management operations in the country, for 800 million euros ($1.05 billion), it said on Sunday.

Caixabank, Spain's third-biggest bank and one of its most acquisitive during the financial crisis, said in a statement that the deal did not include Barclays' investment banking operations in Spain or its credit card business, Barclaycard.
