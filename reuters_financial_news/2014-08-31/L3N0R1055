DUBAI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> will launch an initial public offer  to sell at least 15 percent of its shopping malls and retailing unit on Dubai's main stock market in September, and plans to list the shares in October.

The emirate's largest real estate developer will offer 30 percent of the shares to individual investors and 70 percent to qualified institutional investors, it said in a statement to Dubai's bourse on Sunday. "The pricing of the IPO will be determined via a book-building process with qualified institutional investors who are clients of the Joint Global Coordinators or the Joint Bookrunners," the statement added.
