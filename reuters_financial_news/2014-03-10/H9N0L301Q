HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - China's CSI300 share index sank to a five-year closing low on Monday, dragged down by financials after tepid economic data reignited fears of a bigger slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings dived 3.3 percent, hitting its lowest close since Feb. 2, 2009. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 2.9 percent at 1,999.1 points in its worst day since June 24. [ID:nL3N0M70KU] The Nasdaq-style ChiNext Composite Index <.CHINEXTC> of mainly high tech startups listed in Shenzhen tumbled 3.7 percent. China's consumer prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a risk.
