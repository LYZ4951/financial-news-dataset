STOCKHOLM, March 10 (Reuters) - Swedish households' optimism about the development of house prices over the coming 12 months bounced back to a new post-crisis high in March, a survey by banking group SEB's showed on Monday.

SEB said the balance of households expecting real estate prices to rise against those expecting them to fall is now at it's highest level since 2007. "The explanation lies, probably, in higher incomes, a good development on the stock market and positive signals about the economy in general," SEB economist Jens Magnusson said in a statement. Of the households surveyed, 66 percent said they believe in rising house prices over the next year, compared with 61 percent last month. Twelve percent said they expect prices to fall compared with 14 percent last month. Households expect the repo rate to be 0.88 percent in a year, up from today's 0.75 percent, and only 4 percent plan to fix the interest rate at which they borrow, the survey showed.
