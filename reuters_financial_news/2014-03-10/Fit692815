March 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Non-performing loans are likely to have plateaued at the two large Irish banks at end-2013 ahead of the ECB's comprehensive review, Fitch Ratings says. Their latest annual results incorporate some of the observations from the recent Central Bank of Ireland's balance sheet assessment on loan impairment provisions and risk-weighted assets (RWA), leaving them  better positioned for the ECB review and well placed to return to sustainable  profitability.  Impaired loans had been increasing steadily since 2008, but fell 3% and 2% yoy  at end-2013 at Bank of Ireland <BKIR.I> (BoI) and AIB <ALBK.I>, respectively. Although NPL ratios rose slightly by 1pp to 17% at BoI and by 2pp to 35% at AIB, this was due to the  overall reduction in loan exposures as part of deleveraging plans. We expect NPL  ratios to peak in 2014 and begin to gradually reduce.  The central bank assessed credit risk classifications, loan provisions and the  appropriateness of RWAs as at end-1H13. Both banks had adequate capital to meet  the 10.5% core Tier 1 requirement after the central bank's adjustments. They  also incorporated some of the findings into their 2013 results, so these should  be more conservative. AIB's EUR1.9bn of loan provisions were 24% lower than the previous year, but  largely consistent with the central bank's suggestion for EUR1.1bn of additional  loan impairment charges. It also made some of the EUR1.6bn RWA increases  identified in the central bank's assessment. BoI incorporated part of the  additional EUR846m loan provisions suggested by the central bank into its  EUR1.7bn impairment charge, which was down 3% yoy. It also updated its expected  loss treatment and applied some of the EUR6.8bn RWA adjustments.  But there is still downside risk from the ECB's comprehensive assessment. The  recovery in asset quality is fragile even though it is stabilising. Forbearance  levels are still high even after the Central Bank of Ireland's review. BoI's  forborne loans were around 12% of gross loans with a large 88% not classified as  impaired. Forbearance at AIB's residential mortgages was also at 12%, although  over half were impaired. Performing forborne loans are vulnerable to changes in  affordability and could still feed through to NPLs. Resolution of impaired loans is still a risk for Irish banks. The central bank  published mortgage arrears data last week highlighting that the improving  economy and loan restructurings are helping to reduce mortgage arrears, but  extremely long-term delinquencies continue to rise. The proportion of  owner-occupier loan balances in 90+ day arrears fell 40bp to 17% in the fourth  quarter, the first qoq decline since the data series began in 2009. However, the  proportion of balances in 720+ day arrears rose by 30bp to 6.5%. Following the Irish central bank's assessment, BoI and AIB are more resilient  and unlikely to need more capital. However, we still see weaknesses in capital  composition because BoI's  Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9% and AIB's  ratio of 10.5% under 2017 rules include perpetual preference shares issued as  part of the 2009 bank capitalisation that will be derecognised after 2017.
