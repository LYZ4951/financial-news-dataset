VIENNA, March 10 (Reuters) - Experts advising the Austrian government have found that it is not possible to get bondholders of Hypo Alpe Adria [HAABI.UL] to share the costs of winding down the nationalised Austrian lender, Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger said on Monday.

He told reporters Vienna would quickly start talks with former Hypo owner BayernLB [BAYLB.UL] on burden sharing and that he aimed to have clarity on how to proceed by the end of this month.
