March 10 (Reuters) - Private equity group Permira [PERM.UL] is looking to float Japanese agricultural chemicals company Arysta LifeScience on the New York Stock Exchange, the Financial Times reported quoting people familiar with the situation.

While a sale to a trade buyer is also a possibility, London-based Permira is in talks with banks to discuss an IPO, valuing Arysta at $4 billion including debt, the newspaper said. Permira bought Arysta, which manufactures insecticides and veterinary medicines, in 2008 for 1.95 billion euros ($1.32 billion). Arysta is considering whether to move its domicile from Japan to the United States or a country with lower corporate tax rates, people familiar with the matter were quoted as saying by the FT.
