MUMBAI, Mar 10 (Reuters) - Shares in Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd <RANB.NS> fell as much as 3.8 percent on Monday after the drug maker recalled more than 64,000 bottles of the generic version of a cholesterol-lowering drug in the United States after doseage mix-up was detected.

Ranbaxy confirmed the recall of select batches of the drug, a generic version of Pfizer Inc's <PFE.N> Lipitor, but said the company had not received any product complaints. [ID:nL1N0M507Z]
