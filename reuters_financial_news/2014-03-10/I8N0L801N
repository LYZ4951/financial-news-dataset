MUMBAI, Mar 10 (Reuters) - India's BSE index <.BSESN> managed slight gains on Monday after earlier posting its third consecutive record high as shares of domestic-focused companies, including HDFC Bank <HDBK.NKS>, extended a rally on the back of signs of strong foreign buying.

Foreign investors bought a net 25.77 billion rupees ($420.7 million) of shares on Friday, their biggest daily purchases since Dec. 9. That marked a 16th consecutive buying session for a net total of about $1.4 billion. HDFC Bank provisionally rose 3.5 percent, while Larsen and Toubro <LART.NS> ended 3.3 percent higher. The BSE index <.BSESN> rose 0.05 percent, after earlier hitting an all-time high at 22,023.98.
