MILAN, March 10 (Reuters) - The second biggest shareholder in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> cut its stake in the troubled Italian lender to 1 percent from 4 percent, market watchdog Consob said in a filing on its website on Monday.

The stake was sold by the Aleotti family on March 5, the day when the stock surged 20 percent on speculation the bank's top investor - a not-for-profit banking foundation - was selling its stake.
