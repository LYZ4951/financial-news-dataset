CAPE TOWN, March 10 (Reuters) - South African logistics company Super Group <SPGJ.J>, has bought a majority stake in Chinese-backed Great Wall Motors SA, the companies said in a statement on Monday.

Great Wall made its debut seven years ago in Africa's top automotive exporter, where its pick-ups and sports utility vehicles compete with market leaders such as Toyota <7203.T>, Ford <F.N> and Nissan <7201.T>. Super Group Chief Executive Peter Mountford did not give a value for the 50.1 percent acquisition. In South Africa, Great Wall <601633.SS> has a network of 75 dealers, over 50,000 vehicles on the road and a parts distribution warehouse.
