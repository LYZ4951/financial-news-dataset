March 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency

Fitch Ratings has updated its assumptions for analysing  Norwegian residential mortgage pools. The criteria assumptions will be used for  rating new and existing covered bond programmes backed by Norwegian residential  mortgages. The updated criteria assumptions do not have any impact on the  existing covered bonds programmes backed by Norwegian mortgage pools rated by  Fitch. Since the last criteria update in April 2013, the Norwegian housing market  reached a new peak in mid-2013, but prices have subsequently decreased and  currently stand at similar to 2012 levels. Fitch's current to trough base house  price decline (HPD) assumption remains at 5%. However, the agency has revised  its peak-to-trough HPD assumptions to 9% in a 'B' rating scenario and 52% in a  'AAA' rating scenario to reflect the new market developments. Fitch has not changed its other mortgage loss and cash flow assumptions for  Norway. Mortgage loan performance continues to be strong and the macro-economic  environment outlook for Norway remains positive.
