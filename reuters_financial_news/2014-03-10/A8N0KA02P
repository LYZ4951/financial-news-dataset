ATHENS, March 10 (Reuters) - Alpha Bank <ACBr.AT>, Greece's fourth-largest lender by assets, reported a profit in 2013, thanks to an accounting gain on its acquisition of Emporiki Bank, but without the one-off it was loss-making as provisions for bad debt weighed.

Including a 3.3 billion euro goodwill write-back on Emporiki that was booked in the first quarter, Alpha posted a net profit of 2.92 billion euros ($4.05 billion). Excluding the write-back, the bank lost 304 million euros last year versus a loss of 1.087 billion in 2012.
