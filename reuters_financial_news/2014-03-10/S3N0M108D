OSLO, March 10 (Reuters) - Norway's 2015 budget will see increased use of cash from the country's $850-billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, Finance Minister Siv Jensen said on Monday.

The government, composed of the centre-right Conservatives and the more right-wing Progress Party, began negotiations on Monday over next year's budget, the first by the coalition since winning elections in September.
