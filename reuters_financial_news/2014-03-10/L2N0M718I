WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. government-owned mortgage financiers Fannie Mae <FNMA.OB> and Freddie Mac <FMCC.OB> could send about $179.2 billion in profits back to taxpayers over the next 10 years, the Office of Management and Budget said in a report released on Monday.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under federal conservatorship since 2008, and have returned to profitability as the housing market recovered.
