SANTIAGO, March 10 (Reuters) - A new law that will make it easier for foreigners to invest in Chile's fixed income market has officially taken effect, outgoing Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said on Monday.

The Ley Unica de Fondos, or Investment Funds Act, streamlines regulations governing fixed income investment, replacing five different laws with one piece of legislation while granting foreigners tax exemptions. [ID:nL2N0KR19Q] Foreign participation in Chile's fixed income market has been miniscule, at about 1 percent versus 35-40 percent in equities. But Larrain has said the new law, one of the most important regulatory changes in Chile's financial markets in more than a decade, could change that soon. The law was approved by Congress late last year but its entry into effect, which occurred over the weekend, had been delayed by final administrative work.  Larrain will hand over the reins of the finance ministry to Alberto Arenas on Tuesday when the incoming center-left government of President-elect Michelle Bachelet takes over. [ID:nL2N0KY1IL]
