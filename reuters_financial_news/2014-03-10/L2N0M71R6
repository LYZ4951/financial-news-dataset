WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - The World Bank on Monday said it plans to provide Ukraine up to $3 billion in 2014 to support the country's new government in the midst of its current crisis, though only part of the money would be new.

The bank, a Washington-based lender that focuses on ending poverty, already has several projects in Ukraine. About $2 billion in the funds will be disbursed this year as part of ongoing projects.
