March 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

This announcement replaces the version published earlier  on 10 March 2014, which misstated the rating for the collateral, subordinated  bond. The collateral, subordinated bond is rated 'A-'. Fitch Ratings has assigned MARC Finance Ltd's JPY5bn Series M629 repackaged  notes due 2021 a 'BBB+sf' rating. The Outlook is Stable. This transaction is of  repackaged notes issued outside Japan, with the underlying collateral consisting  of assets also outside Japan.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating reflects the first-to-default risk of the two risk-presenting  entities in this transaction. The referenced risks are related to the  collateral, subordinated bond (rated 'A-') issued by a financial institution,  and the swap counterparty, BNP Paribas [BNPPZL.UL] (A+/Stable), London branch. The rating  also reflects the sound legal structure of the transaction.  The Stable Outlook is based on Fitch's expectations about the creditworthiness  of the risk-presenting entities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating is sensitive to rating migration of the two risk-presenting entities.  A downgrade of the lower rated risk-presenting entity would likely result in a  downgrade to the notes. At closing, the issuer pays the note proceeds in Japanese yen to the swap  counterparty and invests the received amount in euros in collateral securities.
