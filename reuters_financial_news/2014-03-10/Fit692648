March 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed TDC A/S's (TDC) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'. The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this release. TDC's credit profile is underpinned by its strong domestic position,  particularly in the fixed line business. Despite the company suffering from  difficult competitive and regulatory drags, its ability to reduce costs has  allowed it to limit the decline in EBITDA over the past few years. While these  competitive and regulatory drags should ease, Fitch anticipates that the pace of  efficiency gains will also slow.  KEY DRIVERS Strong Fixed-Line Market Position Uniquely, TDC owns both the Danish incumbent copper network and the majority of  the cable infrastructure in the country. This gives the company an exceptionally  strong fixed line position compared with all other European incumbents and helps  the company generate best-in-class EBITDA margins. Excluding the Nordic  business, the company's FY13 EBITDA margin was 46.1%. In recent years, TDC's  strong fixed line market share has been partly eroded by the aggressive fibre  rollout and competitive moves of utility operators. The future strategy of these  utility providers remains uncertain. Reflecting the company's strong operating  profile, Fitch has increased the funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net  leverage downgrade guidance to 3.75x from 3.5x.  Comfortable Headroom  TDC's EBITDA fell to DKK10.15bn in 2013, from DKK10.3bn in 2012 and DKK10.5bn in  2011. Most other European incumbents suffered more severe declines within the  same timeframe. The company's guidance is for a further decline of EBITDA in  2014 but for it to remain above DKK9.8bn. Such a decline would be compatible  with the 'BBB rating', which is also supported by the company's leverage policy  limit of 2.2x net debt/EBITDA. For TDC's rating to be upgraded, the company must  demonstrate that its strong qualitative factors translate into improved  financial performance, in addition to maintaining FFO adjusted net leverage  below 3.0x.  Cost Savings Almost Offsetting Revenue Pressure Despite TDC suffering from difficult competitive and regulatory drags, the  company's ability to reduce costs has allowed it to limit the decline in EBITDA  over the past few years. TDC's cost base flexibility is amongst the strongest in  its peer group, although Fitch expects the pace of these cost reductions might  diminish over the coming few years.  Increased Fixed-to-Mobile Substitution As TDC's flat rate mobile telephony packages have proliferated, the company has  seen an increase in fixed-to-mobile substitution, with low-ARPU landline  subscribers choosing to drop their landline voice product in favour of mobile  only. Landline telephony contributed 17% of the company's gross profit in 2013,  so a further acceleration in this trend is likely to put additional pressure on  group EBITDA.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - A negative rating action could occur if FFO adjusted net leverage exceeds  3.75x over a sustained period of time. - A marked deterioration in TDC's operating environment or adverse regulatory  decisions. Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating action include: - FF adjusted net leverage below 3.0x, together with evidence of an improved  operational and financial performance.  The rating actions are as follows: Long-term IDR: affirmed at 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook Senior unsecured notes: affirmed at 'BBB'
