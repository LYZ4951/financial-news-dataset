BRASILIA, March 10 (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate is expected to have remained steady in February as a sharp, seasonal increase in school tuition costs offset a slower advance in food prices, a Reuters poll showed.

Other data to be released this week could also show a modest rebound in industrial output in January following a sharp, unexpected plunge in December. Both reports are forecast to add to signs that Brazil's economy entered 2014 at a slightly stronger pace than in 2013, but is still grappling with stubborn inflation, which is expected to accelerate again later in the year. The benchmark IPCA consumer price index <BRCPIY=ECI> likely rose 5.64 percent in the 12 months through February, up slightly from 5.59 percent in January, according to the median forecast of 26 economists. The official inflation target is 4.5 percent, with a tolerance margin of two percentage points. On a monthly basis, the IPCA index <BRCPI=ECI> is expected to rise 0.65 percent, up from 0.55 percent in January, the median of 32 estimates showed. "We expect the diffusion index (measuring the number of services and goods with price hikes) to remain above 60 percent, which characterizes a scenario of widespread price increases," Banco Santander analysts wrote in a research note. Inflation has been above the centerpoint of the central bank's target range for over three years, which last April prompted policymakers to begin raising interest rates off record lows to a current 10.75 percent <BRCBMP=ECI>. Still, a tight labor market and rising energy prices due to low reservoir levels at the country's hydroelectric dams are set to push inflation above 6 percent later this year, analysts say, in what could become one of the greatest challenges to President Dilma Rousseff's re-election hopes in October. Industrial output <BRIO=ECI> probably rose a non-seasonally-adjusted 2.5 percent in January from the prior month, reversing only part of the 3.5 percent decline seen in December, according to the median of 31 forecasts. "Markets should focus on the capital goods sector, which showed the most strength in 2013, but has started to lose momentum," analysts with BNP Paribas wrote in a note. IBGE will release its industrial output report at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) on Tuesday and the IPCA report is due at 9 a.m. local on Wednesday.
