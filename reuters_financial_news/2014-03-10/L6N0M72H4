LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Daily spot foreign exchange trading volumes on Thomson Reuters <TRI.TO> dipped in February from a month earlier, still showing improvement from long-term lows hit at the end of last year but down an average of $24 billion on a year ago.

Along with another major currency trading host, ICAP-owned EBS <IAP.L>, the share of Thomson Reuters' Matching service in the world's biggest market has fallen in the face of competition from players such as Hotspot FX and commodities-dominated exchange CME. Daily volumes on Thomson Reuters Matching fell to $113 billion in February from $117 billion in January and $137 billion a year ago. However, trading on FXAll, the company's electronic platform for buyside customers, was almost unchanged on the month and up 10 percent year-on-year at $122 billion. By comparison, ICAP said last week that volumes on the EBS platform fell 5 percent in February from January and 44 percent on the year, to $149 billion.  A rise in Chinese yuan trading - prompted by Beijing's efforts over the past month to halt the currency's steady rise, creating more market volatility and hence volumes of trade - have boosted trading, Thomson Reuters said. "Trading volumes on Thomson Reuters venues remained steady through February which was a slower month due to fewer trading days and Chinese New Year," Phil Weisberg, global head of Foreign Exchange at Thomson Reuters, said.
