MILAN, March 10 (Reuters) - The top investor in Italy's No.3 bank by asset, Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI>, has sold shares worth 40.6 million euros ($56.35 million) on the market, equivalent to 1.6 percent of the bank's market capitalisation, regulatory filings showed.

The sale took place in three tranches on March 6, 7 and 10, coming on the heels of a 20-percent market rally on March 5 that traders said had been triggered by speculation the investor, a cash-strapped charitable foundation, was selling down its bank holdings.
