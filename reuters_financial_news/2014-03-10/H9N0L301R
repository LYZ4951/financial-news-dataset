HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares suffered their biggest one-day loss in five weeks on Monday, after a slew of tepid China economic data over the weekend reignited fears of a bigger slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> finished down 1.8 percent at 22,264.9 points, while the China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also sank 1.8 percent. This was their biggest one-day loss since Feb. 4. [ID:nL3N0M70KU]  China's consumer prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a risk.
