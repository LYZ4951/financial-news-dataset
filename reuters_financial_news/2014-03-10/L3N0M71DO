SEOUL, March 10 (Reuters) - Seoul shares suffered their biggest daily slide in more than a month on Monday, as investors dumped riskier assets on unexpected weakness in China's trade data and on rising tensions in Ukraine.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 1 percent at 1,954.43 points on Monday, marking the index's biggest daily loss since Feb. 4. Net sales by institutions weighed heavily on the index as they dumped 275.0 billion won ($259.27 million) worth of local stocks on Monday. Foreign net sales totaled 32.6 billion won.
