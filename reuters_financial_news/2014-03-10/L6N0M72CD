LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - French retailer Vivarte has made a start to restructure its burdensome debt pile by entering a four-month conciliation process, the company announced in a statement on Monday.

A mandataire ad hoc was previously appointed to mediate talks between Vivarte and its lenders after Vivarte failed to get agreement from two-thirds of its lenders to suspend loan covenant tests by a deadline of January 22. In response, lenders appointed financial advisory firm Houlihan Lokey. [ID:nL5N0LA429] Last month, Vivarte said during a first meeting between its lenders and the mandataire that the company would hold off making any payments on its debt.  Vivarte has now entered into a conciliation process to restructure its debt. The mandataire has become a 'Conciliateur' and will negotiate a way forward between the company and its lenders.  At the same time, 90 percent of lenders have agreed to a suspension of Vivarte's next debt payment, the statement said. The payment was due this month.  One likely outcome of the conciliation process is a write down of some of Vivarte's debt in return for equity. Charterhouse is expected to stay involved in the company, banking sources said.
