HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - China's CSI300 share index extended losses in afternoon trade on Monday, dragged down by financials after tepid economic data reignited fears of a bigger slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

At 0619 GMT, the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares listings was down 3 percent at its lowest intra-day level since June 25. The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was down 2.6 percent.
