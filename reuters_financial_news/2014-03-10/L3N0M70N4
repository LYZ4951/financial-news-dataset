TAIPEI, March 10 (Reuters) - Taiwan stocks dropped 0.70 percent on Monday morning, in line with other regional bourses, as disappointing trade data from China gave investors pause.

The main TAIEX index <.TWII> fell 61.20 points to 8652.76 as of 0152 GMT. The market had closed flat in the previous session after cresting more than two-and-a-half-year highs earlier in the week.
