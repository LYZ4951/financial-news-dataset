PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - The French economy is set to grow by 0.2 percent in the first quarter, the central bank said on Monday, sticking with its first estimate.

That would mark a slight slowdown from the fourth quarter of last year, when the euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent.
