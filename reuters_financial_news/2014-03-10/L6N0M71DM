KAMPALA, March 10 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> weakened on Monday after cuts to foreign aid prompted by the country's law banning homosexuality undermined confidence in east Africa's third-largest economy.

Traders say liquidity mop-ups by the central bank and mid-month tax payments could offer some support.  Four European donors have either suspended or withheld budget support after Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last month signed legislation that imposed harsh penalties on gays, including jail terms of up to life.  At 0918 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2,522/2,527, weaker than Friday's close of 2,515/2,520.  "Because of the aid cuts I think everybody is kind of cautious on the shilling in the interbank (market)," said Shahzad Kamaluddin, a trader at Crane Bank. "That's putting some pressure (on the shilling) although we have these regular mop-ups by the central bank and mid-month taxes are coming up so I don't see the shilling weakening a lot." Kamaluddin said the central Bank of Uganda on Monday issued a repo worth 285 billion shillings ($113.32 million) which followed another 231 billion shillings sucked out of the market on Friday, reflecting the bank's determination to keep local currency liquidity on a tight leash.  The legislation threatening life in jail for "aggravated homosexuality" and a seven-year term for "aiding and abetting homosexuality has drawn widespread condemnation, especially from Western governments and human rights groups.  In addition to the four donors, the World Bank has also postponed a $90 million loan intended for Uganda's health sector. Aid is a key source of hard currency for Uganda and any sign it might be disrupted tends to rattle the foreign exchange market.  "Aid cuts will keep the shilling under some vulnerability... I also see some foreign corporates exerting demand this month to pay 2013 dividends," said Robert Mpuuga, a trader at Housing Finance Bank. "That could also pose some depreciation risk."
