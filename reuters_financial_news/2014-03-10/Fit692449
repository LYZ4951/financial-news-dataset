March 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings to Indonesia-based PT Surya Artha Nusantara Finance's (SANF) proposed unsecured medium-term notes (MTNs) as follows:  - MTNs with maturity of two and three years assigned National Long-Term Rating  of 'AA(idn)'; and  - MTNs with maturity of 370 days assigned National Short-Term Rating of  'F1+(idn)'. The MTN issue will be up to IDR1trn in size and the proceeds will be used to  support the company's business growth.   'AA' National Long-Term Ratings denote expectations of very low default risk  relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default risk  inherent differs only slightly from that of the country's highest rated issuers  or obligations. 'F1' National Short-Term Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The MTNs are rated at the same level as SANF's National Long-Term and Short-Term  Ratings. This is because they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and  senior obligations of the company, and rank equally with all its other senior  obligations.  SANF's ratings reflect Fitch's expectation of continued strong support and  commitment from its majority shareholder, PT Astra Internasional Tbk <ASII.JK> (AI). SANF  was established in 1983 by the Astra Group focusing on the heavy equipment  leasing business. It is owned by Astra Group (60%) and Marubeni Group (40%). The  ratings also take into account SANF's strategic importance to the Astra Group as  its financing arm. It helps expand the latter's heavy equipment distributor  business in Indonesia through its subsidiary, PT United Tractors Tbk <UNTR.JK>.  Fitch expects an increase in credit costs stemming from a prolonged slowdown in  the commodity sector to hurt SANF's profitability. However, SANF's asset quality  will remain manageable given its strong provisions.  RATING SENSITIVITIES
