LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether currency traders distorted prices for options and exchange-traded funds by manipulating benchmark foreign exchange rates, Bloomberg New reported on Monday.

The SEC's probe is at an early stage, Bloomberg reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates foreign exchange derivatives, is also investigating possible manipulation, the news agency reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Neither the SEC nor the CFTC was immediately available to comment.  Britain's Financial Conduct Authority was unavailable for comment.  Regulators across Europe, Asia and the United States are carrying out investigations into allegations senior traders exchanged market-sensitive information via electronic communications to manipulate key currency rates, known as "fixings". Bank of England governor Mark Carney faces questioning from UK lawmakers on Tuesday into what Bank officials knew about these allegations, after the central bank suspended an employee last week in relation to the investigation.
