MUMBAI, March 10 (Reuters) - Indian shares briefly a record high on Monday on the back of continued strong foreign buying in blue chips such as HDFC Bank <.HDBK.NS>, but edged lower soon afterwards on profit-taking and because of falls in regional shares.

The benchmark BSE index's <.BSESN> all-time high of 22,005.54 points marked its third consecutive record high in as many sessions, while the broader NSE index's <.NSEI> hit a second consecutive milestone at 6,545.10 points. Foreign investors posted on Friday their biggest daily purchases since Dec. 9, or a net 25.77 billion rupees ($420.73 million). That marked a 16th consecutive buying session for a net total of about $1.4 billion.
