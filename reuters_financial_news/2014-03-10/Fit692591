March 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based PT Sarana Multigriya Finansial (Persero)'s [SMFIN.UL] (SMF) National Long-Term Rating at 'AA(idn)' and its National Short-Term Rating at 'F1+(idn)'.  The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed SMF's rupiah denominated senior  bond at 'AA(idn)'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this  commentary. 'AA' National Ratings denote expectations of very low default risk relative to  other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default risk inherently  differs only slightly from that of the country's highest rated issuers or  obligations.  'F1' Short-Term National Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Fitch's expectation of extraordinary state support for the  company, if needed. This expectation is based on SMF's growing policy role in  developing the secondary mortgage market in Indonesia and its 100% direct state  ownership. The ratings also factor in the absence of an explicit state guarantee  for SMF's liabilities and lower systemic importance relative to large  state-owned Indonesian banks.  Fitch expects SMF to expand its loan portfolio by IDR3trn in 2014, supported  mainly by debt issues. Its total outstanding loans, comprising loans to banks  and finance companies, have grown significantly to about IDR6.2trn at end-2013  from IDR4.8trn at end-2012 due to increasing mortgage demand. At end-2013 all  loans were classified as performing.  SMF's policy role is expanding as it facilitated the launch of six onshore  residential mortgage-backed securities totalling IDR3.96trn in 2009-2013. This  is in line with SMF's long-term plan to develop its role as credit guarantor for  mortgage lenders or mortgage-backed issues in addition to providing funds.  Fitch expects SMF's profitability to remain thin given its role in providing  long-term funding for the primary mortgage market at competitive rates.  Profitability is not SMF's main objective due to its public policy role.  SMF was established by the government of Indonesia in 2005 and is regulated and  supervised by the Ministry of Finance.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Downward rating pressure could arise from any perceived reduction in the  government's willingness to provide extraordinary support to SMF, especially if  SMF's mandate were to become less important for the mortgage sector's  development, although this seems unlikely in the medium-term. Although limited  by SMF's small size relative to larger government banks and the absence of an  explicit state guarantee, positive rating action for SMF is possible if its  policy role was to become more systemically important and backed by more  tangible forms of state support.
