BANGKOK, March 10 (Reuters) - Malaysian shares fell to a near one-month low on Monday amid heavy selling in Malaysian Airline stocks <MASM.KL> after a Boeing 777 operated by the airline went missing over the weekend while most markets eased as weak Chinese data dented sentiment.

Malaysia's main stock index <.KLSE> closed down 0.6 percent at 1,822.06, its lowest close since Feb. 14. Malaysian Airline System shares ended 4 percent lower, losing 18 percent at one point to a record low of 0.205 ringgit. About 385 million shares changed hands in the session, 9.15 times the full-day average over the past 30 sessions. The disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner is an "unprecedented aviation mystery", a senior official said on Monday, with a massive air and sea search now in its third day failing to find any confirmed trace of the plane or the 239 people aboard. [ID:nL3N0M70SI] Other aviation-related shares were also weaker. Shares of Malaysia Airports Holdings <MAHB.KL> were down 1.7 percent. Singapore's key index <.FTSTI> fell 0.3 percent after four sessions of gains. Property shares such as CapitaLand <CATL.SI> were among the losers amid expectations about slowing property demand, according to a local broker. Investors trimmed holding in commodities and coal mining shares such as Indonesia's Adaro Energy <ADRO.JK> and Thailand's Banpu <BANPU.BK> after weekend data showed China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February. [ID:nL3N0M508C] The Thai SET index <.SETI> fell 0.4 percent while Indonesia's main index <.JKSE> eased 0.2 percent amid caution ahead of the central bank's interest rate reviews later in the week. Bank Indonesia was expected to hold its benchmark reference rate <BIPG> unchanged at 7.5 percent at a policy meeting on Thursday. [ID:nL3N0M72M4] The Bank of Thailand's monetary policy committee is expected to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent in a meeting on Wednesday to help the economy cope with prolonged political unrest in Bangkok.
