WELLINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand house prices rose for the first time in three months in February, while the number of houses sold increased less than usual from the previous month, the Real Estate Institute of NZ (REINZ) said on Tuesday.

The REINZ said first home buyers deterred by stricter lending rules imposed last year may be tentatively returning to the market, while the increase in prices suggested more higher priced houses are being sold. "This may indicate that while first home buyers are mostly sitting on the sidelines, the focus on the market has moved to higher price ranges, with a subsequent upward influence on the median price," said REINZ chief executive Helen O'Sullivan. The housing market has picked up since early 2012, particularly in Auckland, the country's biggest city, and earthquake-damaged Christchurch, as a shortage of houses in both cities has been bolstering prices. Limits on how much retail banks can lend on low deposit home loans have been in place since last October by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to slow the rise in house prices. The central bank is expected to start raising interest rates this week. It has said previously the state of the housing market will be a key factor in the timing and extent of rises.
