LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - British outsourcer Capita <CPI.L> was named as the preferred bidder for a 10-year contract to manage the government's 21 billion pound ($35 billion) military estate, gaining an edge over rival Serco to the post.

The move comes as a blow to embattled rival Serco <SRP.L>, which had hoped to win the contract to help ease fears over the state of its relationship with the British government following a series of high profile contact failures such as the tagging of criminals.
