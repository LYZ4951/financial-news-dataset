HANOI, March 17 (Reuters) - Vietnam's central bank will lower the ceiling on interest rates that banks can offer on dong deposits to 6.0 percent per annum from 7.0 percent now, state-run Voice of Vietnam radio said on Monday.

The State Bank of Vietnam will also cut its refinance rate on dong loans to 6.5 percent from 7 percent, and lower the ceiling on dollar deposit rates to 1.0 percent from 1.25 percent at present, the radio station said in its morning news bulletin. The rate cuts would be made "this week", the report said, without giving a more specific date.
