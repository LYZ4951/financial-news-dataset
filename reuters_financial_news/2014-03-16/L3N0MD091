KUALA LUMPUR, March 16 (Reuters) - Malaysian investigators are still waiting for some countries to send background checks on passengers who were on a missing Malaysia Airlines <MASM.KL> jetliner as they intensify inquiries into a suspected deliberate diversion of the plane, the country's police chief said on Sunday.

"There are still a few countries yet to respond to our requests," Khalid Abu Bakar told a news conference. Police are also investigating airport ground staff and have intensified their checks on the two pilots, including examining a flight simulator seized from the captain's home, he said.
