DUBAI, July 6 (Reuters) - Positive news flow may lift most markets in the region on Sunday after profit-taking at the end of last week slowed rallies on several bourses.

The announcement on Saturday that Dubai is pressing ahead with a project to build an entertainment and hotel district, which is to include the world's largest shopping mall, may cheer investors in the emirate. [ID:nL6N0PG0GO] The "Mall of the World" project was originally announced 18 months ago, and Saturday's announcement did not give details of timing, cost or financing. But the government's bullish presentation of the plan may nevertheless help sentiment. Dubai's bourse <.DFMGI> halted its rally last Thursday as investors, some of whom suffered heavy losses in last month's slump, were quick to book profits on rebounding blue chip. But shares in Arabtec <ARTC.DU>, which dominate trading volumes, were up 6.3 percent, suggesting the company had partially managed to quell the market's fears about its future following a management reshuffle. Saudi Arabia's market <.TASI> is likely to be supported by heavyweight Saudi Basic Industries Corp <2010.SE> (SABIC), which proposed a cash dividend for the first half of 2014 of 2.5 riyals per share, up from 2.0 riyals a year ago. [ID:nL6N0PE410] In Oman, Galfar Engineering <GECS.OM> may attract investors after winning a $105 million road building contract in the country. The deal may be taken as a positive sign that the company can still win state contracts after former executives were jailed earlier this year for corruption. [ID:nL6N0M60E5] A decision by the government of Egypt to cut fuel subsidies in order to shore up state finances lifted the local market <.EGX30> when it was announced at the end of last week. On Saturday, Egypt slashed its natural gas subsidies to several industries, raising gas prices by 30-75 percent. [ID:nL6N0PG07P] These steps may crimp some companies' profits but are generally seen by investors as proof that the Cairo government is willing to carry out unpopular but necessary reforms. Kuwait's bourse <.KWSE>, however, may be weak after police dispersed demonstrators at a rally last Thursday and said they had thrown stones, burned car tyres and blocked roads.
