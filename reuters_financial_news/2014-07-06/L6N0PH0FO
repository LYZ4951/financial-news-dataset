AIX-EN-PROVENCE, July 6 (Reuters) - France's finance minister said on Sunday he was not worried about French banks being investigated by U.S. authorities after a record fine was imposed on BNP Paribas for violating U.S. sanctions against several countries.

On Tuesday, BNP <BNPP.PA> pleaded guilty in the United States to two criminal charges and agreed to pay almost $9 billion to settle accusations it violated U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran. [ID:nL6N0PC5WK] According to U.S. sources, French banks Societe Generale <SOGN.PA> and Credit Agricole <CAGR.PA> and Germany's Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> are being investigated for having potentially violated U.S. economic sanctions. [ID:nL2N0P6288] Asked if he was worried about the French banks being probed, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said: "No." "I think the risk is rather being perceived by other very big European banks."
