July 6 (Reuters) - Private equity firm 3i Group Plc <III.L> is considering a sale or initial public offering of its Finish telecommunication unit, Eltel Networks, in a deal that may value it about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) including debt, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.

Morgan Stanley <MS.N> and French bank BNP Paribas SA <BNPP.PA> were advising on the sale, but no final decision had been made, the news agency reported, quoting two people with knowledge of the matter.  3i bought the Espoo, Finland-headquartered electricity and telecommunications network maintenance firm from Industri Kapital, TeliaSonera <TLSN.ST> and Eltel management in 2007.
