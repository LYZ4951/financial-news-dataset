CAIRO, July 6 (Reuters) - Egypt's Beltone Financial <BTFH.CA> and billionaire Naguib Sawiris were offered 48 percent of the shares they were seeking for a 20-percent stake in investment bank EFG Hermes <HRHO.CA>, traders said on Sunday, the last day of the offer period.

Beltone and Sawiris's New Egypt Investment Fund had offered around $257 million for the EFG stake at 16.00 Egyptian pounds ($2.24) per share, but an independent financial advisor set the fair share price at 22.93 pounds. [ID:nL6N0P903O]
