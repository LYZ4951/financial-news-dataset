MUMBAI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Indian overnight cash rates <INROND=> fell to 6.80 percent on Monday, the lowest level since Jan. 2, on the back of month-end government spending and in a reflection of term repo auctions totaling over 1 trillion rupees ($16.37 billion) over the past two weeks.

Rates had closed Friday at 7.10/7.15 percent after hovering above 9 percent for most of July due to reduced government spending. Still, traders say they broadly expect the rate to hover around 8 percent in the near-term and said a few trades in the afternoon had brought down the rate.
