DUBAI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Middle East stock markets look set to continue consolidating on Monday amid uncertainty about the global trend, though Saudi Arabia could keep outperforming after authorities announced its opening to direct foreign investment early next year.

Asian shares are marginally higher on Monday morning, but there is concern that the uptrend in U.S. equities may be ending after their sharp falls late last week. This kept most Middle East markets sluggish on Sunday. [ID:nL4N0QA04Q] However, Saudi Arabia <.TASI> rose 0.9 percent on Sunday as local and foreign investors continued to buy in anticipation of the market opening, which was announced late last month. Bourse data showed the value of shares brought by foreigners indirectly through swap agreements rose to 3.53 billion riyals ($941 million) in July from 1.66 billion riyals in June - an increase that suggests the market's uptrend could have a while to run, though Saudi valuations no longer look particularly cheap to fund managers.
