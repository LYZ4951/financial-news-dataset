Aug 4 (Reuters) - Excess liquidity held by euro zone banks will fall to 100 billion euros by September, when the European Central Bank is due to offer another round of cheap cash to lenders, a Reuters poll of euro money market traders found.

Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=>, extra cash that banks hold over and above their daily needs, is currently around 159 billion euros. That is down from over 800 billion euros in early 2012 when the ECB flushed euro zone money markets with more than 1 trillion euros of crisis loans to avert a credit crunch. Excess liquidity has fallen as banks have already repaid more than half of those crisis loans, which fall due in December and February. Banks are keen to make early repayments because they want to pass Europe-wide stress tests, due to be conducted by the ECB to assess how institutions would withstand future crises. Banks are expected to repay another 3.0 billion euros of those loans next week, slightly less than the 3.2 billion euros they will pay back this week.
