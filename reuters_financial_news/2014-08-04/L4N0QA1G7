SEOUL, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The South Korean won <KRW=> rose on Monday after hitting a three-month low last week, while the KOSPI edged up despite pressure from Wall Street's heavy losses.

The won gained partly on dollar weakness after the greenback suffered its biggest one-day fall in nearly a month following a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report on Friday. The local currency <KRW=KFTC> ended at 1,033.5 on Monday, up 0.35 percent from Friday's close at 1,037.1. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.35 percent at 2,080.42 points against Friday's onshore close at 2,073.10, after a third week of gains.  Foreign investors purchased a net 201 billion won ($194.54 million) worth of KOSPI shares, while domestic institutional investors sold a net 153 billion won ($148.08 million).
