Aug 4 (Reuters) - Trade ties between the United States and Africa will be hit if the U.S. Congress decides to close the Export-Import bank, the Financial Times reported General Electric Co <GE.N> Chief Executive Jeff Immelt as saying.

The Ex-Im Bank provides loans, loan guarantees and credit insurance to help private companies export goods overseas. Its biggest beneficiaries are companies such as Boeing <BA.N> and Caterpillar <CAT.N>, but smaller exporters also receive financing. Ex-Im will be forced to close if Congress does not renew its charter by Sept. 30. [ID:nL2N0Q63DV] Immelt said the bank was crucial for U.S. companies operating in Africa because it showed the government was prepared to have "some skin in the game", the FT reported. (http://on.ft.com/WVN5SO) The closure will mean that "we are basically making a statement as a country that we do not think that exports are important," Immelt said.
