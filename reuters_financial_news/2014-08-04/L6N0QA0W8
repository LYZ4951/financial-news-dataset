PARIS, Aug 4 (Reuters) - France has gathered support to challenge recent heavy U.S. penalties on foreign banks at a G20 meeting of world leaders later this year after the record $8.9 billion fine levied on BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> last month, the Financial Times reported on Monday.

The newspaper said Berlin, London and Rome have backed Paris in its push to have its concerns about so-called U.S. extraterritoriality discussed when leaders of the world's top 20 economies meet in Brisbane, Australia in November. The report citied officials from France and other European nations.
