LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - HSBC <HSBA.L> said it was facing unprecedented demands on its staff and operations from regulatory reforms as it reported a 12 percent drop in profits in the first half of the year.

Europe's biggest bank said on Monday pretax profits in the six months to the end of June were $12.3 billion, down from $14.1 billion a year earlier and just below an average forecast of $12.5 billion from 15 analysts polled by the company. [ID:nL6N0Q74BG] The fall was mainly due to a weak first three months of the year, when profits fell 20 percent from a year ago when the bank's revenues were boosted by asset sales.
