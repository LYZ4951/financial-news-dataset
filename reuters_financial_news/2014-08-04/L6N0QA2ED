DUBAI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Dubai's largest developer Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> reported a 28.6 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Monday, beating analyst forecasts, but revenue from property sales in the emirate dropped.

The builder of the world's tallest tower Burj Khalifa made a net profit of 868 million dirhams ($236.3 million) in the three months ending June 30, compared to 675 million dirhams in the corresponding period in 2013, it said in a statement on Dubai's bourse. The earnings beat analyst estimates who predicted an average net profit of 839.8 million dirhams for the period. [ID:nL6N0PI1EQ]
