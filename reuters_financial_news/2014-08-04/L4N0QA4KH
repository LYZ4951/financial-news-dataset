Aug 4 (Reuters) - British construction company Carillion <CLLN.L> is planning to approach investors who also have stakes in Balfour Beatty <BALF.L> in the hopes of reviving merger talks to buy the company, the Times reported on Monday.

Balfour in July walked away from a deal intended to create a possible 3 billion pound ($5 billion) infrastructure giant, after Carillion insisted the company terminate the planned sale of its U.S. engineering and design unit, Parsons, and keep it as part of the merged firm. [ID:nL6N0Q621R] The move surprised Carillion, who said it believed in the strategic rationale of the deal. [ID:nL6N0Q648E] Carillion now hopes to sway investors it shares with Balfour to persuade the company in returning to the negotiation table, the Times said, without naming its sources. http://thetim.es/1xYbwtZ) The daily added that the overlap of institutions who held investments in the company was not a significant number.
