BOSTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management said on Monday that it has hired Houlihan Lokey as a financial advisor as it seeks to persuade InterContinental Hotels Group <IHG.L> to consider selling itself.

The $3 billion San Francisco-based hedge fund owns a 4 percent stake in the hotel group and has been urging the British company to consider combining with a larger hotel operator for several months. "This review will focus on various alternatives including, but not limited to, improving capital structure and/or capital allocation and strategic transactions," Marcato said in a statement. The firm, founded by Mick McGuire who was previously a partner at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, also noted that "current, favorable market conditions" exist now but may not "be available in the future."  A U.S. -based hotel operator has already approached InterContinental, which owns the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands, a person familiar with the matter said.
