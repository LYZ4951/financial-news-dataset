MILAN, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> will soon pay back another 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in emergency loans borrowed from the European Central Bank (ECB) at the height of the euro zone crisis, its chief executive told a conference call on Monday.

"In coming days we'll repay another 1.3 billion euros," CEO Piero Montani said, adding that would leave Carige with a residual 2 billion euros in longer-term crisis loans. Carige said late on Friday that it had so far reimbursed 3.7 billion euros out of 7 billion euros in three-year funds borrowed from the ECB at two extraordinary liquidity tenders in late 2011 and early 2012.
