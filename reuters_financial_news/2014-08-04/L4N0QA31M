BANGKOK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Stocks in Thailand climbed to a near one-week high on Monday amid foreign-led buying and gains in large caps such as PTT <PTT.BK> and Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK> while Indonesia recouped early loss as investors awaited second quarter economic data.

Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> was up 1.3 percent at 1,519.38, the highest close since July 30. Foreign investors bought shares worth a net 1.1 billion baht ($34.2 million) after four straight days of net selling valued a combined 5 billion baht ($155.4 million), Thomson Reuters data showed. [TH/TRADING02] Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> closed up 0.6 percent after a choppy session. It slipped at one point after data showed Indonesia's trade balance swung back into a deficit in April-June after a surplus in the first quarter. [ID:nL4N0QA0LS] Indonesia on Tuesday will report second-quarter economic growth, which is expected to rebound from the slowest pace in four years, thanks to increased spending linked to the country's presidential election. [ID:nL4N0QA2E6] Most others in Southeast Asia notched up gains as shares with strong quarterly results outperformed including Singapore's Sembcorp Marine <SCMN.SI> and Philippine property developer SM Prime Holdings <SMPH.PS>.
