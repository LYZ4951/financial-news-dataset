RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista will transfer 17.1 million shares, or 10.5 percent, of his iron ore mining company MMX Mineração e Metalicos SA <MMXM3.SA> to Abu Dhabi government investment fund Mubadala Development Corp [MUDEV.UL], MMX said in a statement on Monday.

The transaction between Batista and Mubadala will cut his stake to 46 percent of the Rio de Janeiro-based company. That will end his full control of the company but he will remain the largest shareholder.
