LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - HSBC's <HSBA.L> Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said it would cost his bank "hundreds of millions of pounds" each year to separate its UK retail operations and would cost a "very substantial" one-off amount to set up.

HSBC said on Monday a growing body of international regulations was putting its staff under unprecedented pressure and discouraging them from taking risks. [ID:nL6N0QA1W3]
