Aug 4 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Ardian was in talks to buy PE fund stakes worth more than $2 billion from the investment vehicle of the Abu Dhabi government, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources.

Paris-based Ardian, formerly known as Axa Private Equity, has made a bid on portfolios that Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) is looking to sell, the news agency quoted two people with knowledge of the deal as saying.
