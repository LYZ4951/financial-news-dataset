Aug 4 (Reuters) - P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc said on Monday that a data breach that came to light in June had affected credit and debit cards used at 33 locations in the continental United States.

The operator of Asian-themed restaurants said the potentially stolen credit and debit card data included card numbers and, in some cases, the cardholder's name and the card's expiration date.
