MILAN, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Italian mid-sized lender Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> expects to close by the end of 2014 the sale of its insurance units to an affiliate of U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management <APO.N> that it is in exclusive talks with until end-September.

"A first deadline is in September, we are confident we can close by the end of the year," CEO Piero Montani told an analyst call on Monday. Carige, one of 15 Italian lenders targeted by a sector review across the euro zone this year, is shedding assets and cutting loans in an effort to strengthen its capital base after posting a 1.76 billion euro loss last year in a balance-sheet clean-up. Montani said he did not expect any "disasters" following the pan-European banking health check. "They may tell us to do something, but I do not anticipate major disasters." He said Carige estimated that overall asset sales should add between 80 and 90 basis points to its best-quality Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - with most of the impact coming from the sale of Carige's two insurance units. Carige is looking to sell also its leasing and factoring activities. Its best-quality CET 1 capital ratio was 9.9 percent in July Montani said, including the effect of an 800 million euro share sale. That level falls to 8.2-8.3 percent if so-called Basel III rules are fully, instead of partially, applied, he said.
