BUCHAREST, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate <ROINTR=ECI> by 25 basis points to a record low of 3.25 percent on Monday, surprising the market, helped by falling inflation.

It said in a statement it kept the minimum reserve requirement on commercial banks' leu-denominated and hard currency liabilities unchanged. The market had expected flat rates at 3.50 percent. <RO/POLL2> The bank ended a rate-cutting cycle that has lowered borrowing costs by 175 basis points in March 2014. It began easing last year, later than its emerging European peers due to persistently high inflation.
