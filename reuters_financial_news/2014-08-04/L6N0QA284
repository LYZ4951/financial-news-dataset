MOSCOW, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Russian mobile operator Vimpelcom <VIP.O> is expected to report a 53 percent fall in second-quarter net income, highlighting continued weakness in its home market and tough competitive and macroeconomic environment in Italy and Ukraine, a poll showed.

Analysts surveyed by Reuters forecast a net profit of around $270 million on average, down from $573 million a year ago. Core profit, or EBITDA, was seen falling 12 percent while revenue was expected to slid 11 percent, year-on-year. "(The focus will be) whether the company's efforts to improve the user experience (via network quality and customer service) are starting to bear fruit," said Deutsche Bank analyst Igor Semenov. Vimpelcom, which had underinvested at home while expanding abroad, said in May that it was facing a transition year in Russia as it increased infrastructure spending to improve network quality and launched fight for customer loyalty by adjusting tariffs and reducing non-requested services. Russia's No.3 operator, in which Russia's Alfa Group and Norway's Telenor <TEL.OL> are the biggest shareholders, also cut at the time its 2014 targets, saying it expected "low to mid single digit" declines in sales and core profit. [ID:nL6N0O0171]  Local currency devaluation in Russia and Ukraine and lingering pricing pressures in Italy would add to the expected decline in Vimpelcom's Russian subscriber base, Semenov said.Following is a summary of forecasts for Vimpelcom's results (figures in millions of dollars unless otherwise stated):   RevenueEBITDA*  EBITDA margin  Net profit   Average   5,101  2,124  41.6% 269.9  High  5,148  2,186  42.7% 381.0  Low   5,058  2,077  41.0% 115.6  Median5,106  2,122  41.5% 282.0  No of fcsts**11 1111 11  Q2 2013   5,718  2,425  42.4% 573.0  Q1 2014   5,024  2,088  41.6%  39.0
