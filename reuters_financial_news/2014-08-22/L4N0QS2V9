KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Malaysian property developer Sunway Bhd <SWAY.KL> will raise up to 2 billion Malaysian ringgit ($633 million) by issuing Islamic bonds to fund investments, capital expenditure, working capital and pay off future debt.

The company said in a stock exchange filing on Friday that Sunway Treasury Sukuk Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned unit, has received approval to launch a sukuk mudharaba programme for that amount from Malaysia's Securities Commission.  Short-term commercial paper issued under the programme will have maturities of between a month and a year, while medium-term notes will have maturities of one to seven years. Sunway will make its first issuance from the programme within two years.
