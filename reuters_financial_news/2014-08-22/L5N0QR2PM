WARSAW, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Polish rate-setter Jerzy Osiatynski said he needed to make sure that rate cuts would not stoke asset bubbles before he could back monetary easing in ex-communist central Europe's largest economy.

Osiatynski, who has been seen as one of the most dovish policy makers on the Polish central bank's 10-member Monetary Policy Council, also said there were no "macroeconomic grounds" now to keep rates at their current "very high" level, but said this did not automatically mean they should be cut. Financial markets are pricing in 50 basis points worth of rate cuts in Poland over the next five months. <PLNFRA> <WIBOR=> Polish manufacturing activity shrank for the first time in 13 months in July, adding to signals of a slowdown in economic growth. [ID:nL9N0O500Z] "When from the premise of unjustifiably high interest rates we draw the conclusion that they need to be reduced (...) we hope that it will boost credit in the economy," Osiatynski told Reuters in an interview authorised for release on Friday. "Well, not every rise in credit is equally good for the economy," he said, adding that the global financial crisis which started in 2008 had been caused by speculative bubbles. He said the MPC had asked the central bank staff at its last meeting for information on what other countries have done to prevent asset bubbles and how they directed the stream of credit into productive investment, away from speculation. "This will be the basic factor that determines my stance on interest rates in the near future," Osiatynski said, referring to the risk of asset bubbles.  "Are we able to control such a boost to credit in the economy and prevent it from mainly facilitating speculation on the real estate market or other assets?"Poland experienced a boom in house prices in 2006-2008 fuelled by Swiss franc-denominated mortgages. Financial supervisor KNF has since practically prevented banks from extending such loans, but they still account for 8 percent of Poland's gross domestic product (GDP).  SLOWDOWN Data from KNF shows that Poland's housing credit rose by an annual 3 percent in June, well below growth rates of above 20 percent posted in 2011. Total credit to the non-financial sector grew by 4.6 percent year-on-year in June, a moderate pace compared to levels of above 10 percent in 2011-2012. Poland currently has one of the highest inflation-adjusted interest rates among the world's 21 largest economies.  The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 2.50 percent <PLNMR=> since July 2013, after cutting it by 225 basis points in a cycle of easing launched in late 2012. Osiatynski said Polish economic growth would most likely reach 3.0-3.2 percent this year, adding that tit-for-tat trade sanctions between the West and Russia would likely shave off 0.2 percentage points from the pace of expansion. Economists expect the euro zone's woes and the sanctions imposed by Russia to reduce Poland's economic growth in coming quarters and also possibly to prolong a period of technical deflation. Polish exports to Russia and Ukraine fell sharply in the first half of this year. [ID:nL6N0QH2JV] Polish consumer prices fell for the first time in at least three decades in July and the central bank expects prices to continue falling in annual terms for the next few months. [ID:nL6N0QJ2YH] Osiatynski said the technical deflation was making debt harder to repay, thus discouraging investment. He said falling consumer prices meant that pensions and other indexed income of households would barely grow this year, weighing on consumption and, as a result, on investment too. Osiatynski said the MPC would probably vote on a rate cut at its September 2-3 meeting.  "It is hard to speak for the whole Council, but judging from the comments of its other members, published also by Reuters, it is more than likely that such a motion will be filed at its upcoming meeting," Osiatynski said.
