JOHANNESBURG, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Troubles at African Bank Investments are unlikely to have much effect on bigger South African banks, the ratings agency Fitch said on Friday, days after a rival agency downgraded the four biggest banks.

Moody's cut ratings for Standard Bank <SBKJ.J>, FirstRand <FSRJ.J>, Nedbank <NEDJ.J> and the local operation of Barclays Africa <BGAJ.J> on concern the central bank would hesitate to protect creditors should the need arise. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) announced a $1.6 billion rescue package for the unsecured lender African Bank <ABLJ.J> earlier this month. The bank ran into problems as its target market of low-income earners struggled to keep up with loan repayments.   "The recent failure and bail-in of African Bank Limited is isolated and any contagion to the large South African banks is likely to be limited," Fitch said in a statement, adding it would not make any rating changes for the big lenders. Fitch has "bbb" range viability ratings for the top five South African lenders, including Investec <INLJ.J>, but warns the country's deteriorating economy may hurt their performance. Rival Standard & Poor's also said on Thursday it had no plans to downgrade the South African banks. [ID:nL5N0QR1S8] Fitch said the five big banks had only a small exposure to the systemically insignificant Abil, as African Bank is more widely known. They are, however, part of a consortium underwriting 10 billion rand ($935 million) in new capital for Abil. As part of its rescue package, the SARB acquired Abil's 17 billion-rand bad-loan book for 7 billion rand and created a "good bank" worth 26 billion rand. [ID:nL6N0QG105]
