BANGKOK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Indonesia's benchmark index snapped a four-day rising streak on Friday amid selling in recently rallying large caps, while Thai shares eked out more gains to a near 15-month high as investors built positions in tourism-related stocks and retailers.

Jakarta's Composite Index <.JKSE> edged down 0.1 percent, slightly trimming its weekly gain to 1 percent, after active selling in shares of Telkom Indonesia <TLKM.JK> and Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK>, which led among gainers early in the week. "Today's correction is expected, since JCI has risen recently in response to investor expectations for a peaceful and successful presidential election," said John Teja, director of broker Ciptadana Securities. The index earlier rose to a near record high of 5,223.97 amid a rise in the rupiah <IDR=ID>, a day after the country's highest court gave Joko Widodo the green light to lead Southeast Asia's largest economy from its worst slowdown since the global financial crisis. [ID:nL4N0QS13F] Uncertainties over president-elect Widodo's policy, including fuel price hike expectation, would keep the market volatile in the near term, brokers said. [ID:nL4N0QS15N] Thai SET index <.SETI> rose for a fourth straight day, taking its gain on the week to 0.7 percent. It closed at 1,556.97, the highest since May 2013. Shares of Airports of Thailand <AOT.BK> jumped 3.2 percent and Central Pattana <CPN.BK> surged 4.9 percent, reflecting optimism around the domestic political stability after Thailand named a newly-nominated prime minister. [ID:nL4N0QQ2IK] Others in Southeast Asia had a positive week, with stocks in Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> posting modest gains, while the Philippines <.PSI> climbed 1.8 percent and Vietnam <.VNI> notched up 2.6 percent.
