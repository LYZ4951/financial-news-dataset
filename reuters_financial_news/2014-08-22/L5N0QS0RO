ZURICH, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB) [ZKB.UL] said on Friday it had raised the risk provision that covers a tax probe by U.S. authorities as first-half profit fell at the Swiss bank.

Local government-owned ZKB is one of roughly a dozen Swiss banks being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice on suspicion of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes, including Geneva-based Pictet & Cie, the Swiss arm of Israel's Leumi <LUMI.TA> and Julius Baer <BAER.VX>. The cantonal bank raised its risk provision in the first half of 2014 to 697 million Swiss francs ($765.43 million) from 688 million francs at the end of last year.  This provision includes the U.S. tax case, though ZKB said it does not give a detailed breakdown of the individual business risks. It did not provide an update on the state of the probe.  In May, Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties as part of a similar investigation, which raised fears that the other banks under criminal investigation  could face bigger fines than they bargained for. [ID:nL6N0O72AZ] ZKB's performance joined UBS <UBSN.VX> and Credit Suisse in November on a list of Swiss banks whose stability is considered by the Swiss National Bank to be essential for the well-being of the country's financial system. As a result, it is required to meet tougher regulatory requirements. [ID:nL5N0IW0PL] The bank's capital ratio at the end of June was 15.9 percent of risk-weighted assets, exceeding the current regulatory requirement of 13.7 percent. "Zuercher Kantonalbank is deliberately maintaining a high capital base and is prepared to accept a reduction in its return on equity," the bank said in a statement. ZKB posted half-year profit of 336 million francs, 14.6 percent lower on the year. The ultra-low interest rate environment, coupled with mortgage growth of just 1 percent, meant interest income dropped more than 5 percent, the bank said.  The bank's bottom line was also hit by a near-25 percent slide in trading revenue, which the bank attributed to customer restraint due to low market volatility.
