MUMBAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose on Friday to its fourth record high this week as software stocks such as Infosys <INFY.NS> gained after upbeat U.S. and German data drove confidence about the sector's business outlook, while higher global shares also helped.

The 50-shares NSE index <.NSEI> rose as much as 0.48 percent to hit a record high of 7,929.05, surpassing its previous all-time high hit on Wednesday.  Infosys provisionally rose 1.3 percent, while Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> ended 1.2 percent higher.
