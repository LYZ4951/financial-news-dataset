BUENOS AIRES, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Argentina on Friday accused the U.S. judge who called the country's debt restructuring plan illegal of making "imperialist" comments against the South American nation.

Argentine Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa's choice of words were "unfortunate, incorrect and even, I would say, imperialist expressions".
