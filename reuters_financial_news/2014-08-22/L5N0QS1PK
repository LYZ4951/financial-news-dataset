NAIROBI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The chief executive of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), Peter Mwangi, will step down in November after completing the two three-year terms market rules allow, the NSE said on Friday.

Mwangi oversaw the exchange's long-term goal of opening up ownership of the stock market to non-brokers through an initial public offering that closed last week. [ID:nL6N0PY4BB] The NSE said in a statement the search for a new boss would start immediately.  Founded 60 years ago in a hotel in the capital Nairobi, the NSE serves as the main entry point for foreign investors seeking a foothold in east Africa's fast-growing economies. Several Kenyan firms are cross-listed on neighbouring bourses. The NSE has assets of 1.4 billion shillings ($15.9 million) and had a pretax profit of 379 million shillings last year. It had more than 120 listed equities and bonds at the end of 2013.
