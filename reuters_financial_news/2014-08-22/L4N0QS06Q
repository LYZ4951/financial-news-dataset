SINGAPORE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Singapore's United Engineers Ltd <UTES.SI> rose as much as 12 percent on Friday on news that Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp <OCBC.SI> is in talks with a group linked to Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi to sell its stake in the engineering and property firm.

OCBC, along with related companies, has a 36 percent interest in United Engineers and is in talks with the Thai tycoon about a possible sale, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. [ID:nL4N0QR2HE]
