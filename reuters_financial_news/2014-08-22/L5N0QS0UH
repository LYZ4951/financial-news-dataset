Teneva was the last of several senior Corpbank employees - arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting the withdrawal of the money - that have now been released by court decision, without bail and only asked to sign a written agreement not to leave their current address (Standart, Sega, Presa, Duma). PRESA - State public power provider NEK's accumulated debts rose to 3.53 billion levs (2.40 billion US dollar) at the end of June from 3.07 billion levs at the end of 2013, the company said.
