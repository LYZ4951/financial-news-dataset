SEATTLE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The FAA has certified Boeing Co's <BA.N> 787-9 Dreamliner for use with General Electric Co <GE.N> engines, clearing the way for first deliveries of the new aircraft with the U.S.-made engines expected later this month.

The 787-9 is a larger version of the original Dreamliner and had already obtained FAA certification with Rolls-Royce <RR.L> engines. The first delivery of that configuration occurred in June. An FAA certification document dated Thursday showed both the Rolls and GE engines as approved on the 787-9. The FAA and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
