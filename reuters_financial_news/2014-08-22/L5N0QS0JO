LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Britain's Co-operative Bank <COOBF.PK> reported a narrower loss for the first six months of 2014 and said it was encouraged by progress to improve stability, but there was more to be done.

The bank reported a pretax loss of 75.8 million pounds ($126 million), a big improvement on the 844.6 million pound loss it made a year earlier.  "By the measures of capital and liquidity the bank is considerably stronger than it was a year ago," Chief Executive Niall Booker said in a statement on Friday.
