SHANGHAI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - China's state-owned Bank of Communications Co Ltd <601328.SS> <3328.HK>, the country's fifth-largest listed lender, said it is mulling stock incentives for its management as part of a plan to sell stakes to private investors.

Vice President Qian Wenhui told a news conference on Thursday that the bank, known as BoCom, is mulling mixed ownership reforms, which may include stock incentive plans, but added that discussion on any specific details would be premature. The move, if implemented, would be a first for a listed Chinese bank. Qian was speaking after BoCom reported first-half profit was up 5.6 percent, meeting estimates.

[ID:nL4N0QO3JD] Chinese state firms - which control crucial sectors of the economy - are often lambasted for being inefficient and not handing over profits to the nation despite enjoying generous subsidies from the state. The South China Morning Post daily paper reported on Thursday that senior executives of SOEs face pay cuts of up to 50 percent under a reform plan approved by Xi, citing unidentified sources.
