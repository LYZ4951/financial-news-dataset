BOSTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman said on Friday that a total of 35 shareholders who own 31 percent of Allergan Inc.' s <AGN.N> stock have called on the Botox maker to call a special meeting.

Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan's stock, has been working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals <VRX.TO> to try and buy Allergan in a deal valued at $49 billion. Allergan required shareholders owning 25 percent of its shares to submit paperwork. Pershing Square also sued the company in Delaware to compel it to call the meeting.
