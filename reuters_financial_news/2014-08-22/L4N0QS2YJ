HONG KONG, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's securities regulator said on Friday no changes were necessary in local laws to implement a tougher regime that would make banks preparing companies for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the city criminally liable for misstatements in prospectuses.

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) unveiled a new regulatory regime for IPO sponsors in December 2012, but said at the time that amendments to local laws might be necessary to clarify sponsors' civil and criminal liability. After holding further discussions with the financial industry since then, the SFC found changes were not necessary, it said in a statement on Friday.
