MILAN, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Shares in Italy's Banca Etruria <PEL.MI> were up more than 5 percent on Friday after an Italian newspaper reported Banca Popolare di Vicenza did not rule a new bid for the smaller rival.

Popolare Vicenza scrapped a previous bid earlier this year after the board of Banca Etruria failed to give an initial positive assessment. Banca Etruria is still looking for a merger partner as recommended by the Bank of Italy.  On Friday MF daily quoted Popolare Vicenza Chairman Gianni Zonin as saying that a new bid for the Tuscan bank could not be ruled out but it would be at lower prices than the one that fell through. It was not immediately possible to reach Popolare Vicenza for a comment.
