BUDAPEST, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting on Tuesday, ending two years of cuts in its main rate, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Friday.

Monetary policy makers have turned more dovish in recent months, as inflation slowed and in some cases turned negative and the Ukrainian-Russian conflict threatened to curb economic recovery. In the Aug. 19-21 poll, 15 out of 16 analysts said that the bank would hold fire. Only Danske Bank projected that it would cut its 2.1 percent base rate, by 10 basis points. Hungary's central bank said last month, after a 20-basis- point rate cut, that it would not ease rates further, because two years of monthly reductions had brought them to levels consistent with its 3 percent inflation goal. [ID:nL6N0PX4FC] The bank's Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy also said that the bank would keep the base rate unchanged until the end of next year, unless inflation jumps. Most analysts in the poll said the cut a month ago was the bank's last. Their consensus forecast for December was a flat base rate. Some saw a risk that the base rate would start to rise late this year. The median projection was for it to rise to 2.9 percent by the end of next year. "They will surely not hurry into a rate hike, but next year can bring changes as inflation could pick up and the U.S. Federal Reserve could also start to adjust its interest rates higher," said Orsolya Nyeste of Erste Bank. "That could force a moderate upwards adjustment on Hungary, too ... but if the European Central Bank manages to keep its own rates low, the expected rise in U.S. rates may not have an impact on Hungary either," she added. Annual economic growth accelerated to 3.9 percent in the second quarter, bucking a trend towards slower growth in the region.  The bank has also become cautious because of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the possibility the U.S. will raise rates earlier than forecast. Those developments have boosted the forint's <EURHUF=> volatility since the central bank's July rate-setting meeting. The currency has regained some of the ground lost since early this month when it hit its weakest levels against the euro since early 2012. But legislation that boosts the costs of the country's heavily taxed banks could continue to weigh on the currency in the rest of the year. A law on refunds to borrowers imposes a cost of about 900 billion forints on banks. Government plans to convert foreign currency loans into forints by the end of 2014 also pose a threat to bank earnings and the forint's exchange rates. Tit-for-tat sanctions between Russia and the West put further pressure on economic growth and consumer prices in the region, pushing central banks including Hungary into further monetary easing, Danske Bank said in a note. Erste's Nyeste said she doubted that Hungary's central bank would cut rates further.
