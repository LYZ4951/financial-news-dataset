Aug 22 (Reuters) - Pharmacy chain Walgreen Co <WAG.N> suffered a system outage for several hours on Friday, taking all of its 8,200 pharmacy outlets offline and delaying prescription orders.

The company faced a "technical issue" during a system update and had to bring the entire system offline to resolve it, spokesman Michael Polzin said. Some prescription orders were lost as a result of the outage, Polzin said, but most were queued and processed when the system was restored. The pharmacy system was back online by 02:00 p.m. ET.
