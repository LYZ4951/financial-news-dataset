DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Bahrain-based investment firm Arcapita [ARCAB.UL] said on Monday it agreed to sell U.S.-based Varel International [VRLIT.UL] to Sweden's Sandvik AB <SAND.ST> for a total transaction value of $740 million.

Varel, headquartered in Texas, is a manufacturer of drill bits for the oil and gas, and mining and industrial industries. Arcapita, which originally bought the company in 2007, said the Varel sale was still subject to regulatory approvals, and that it hoped to conclude the deal by the end of the first half of 2014.
