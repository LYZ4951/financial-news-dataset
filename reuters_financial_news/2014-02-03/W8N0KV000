WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Polish lender Bank Millennium <MILP.WA> reported a 14-percent rise in its fourth-quarter net profit, in line with market forecasts, helped by higher net interest and commission income, as well as slightly lower impairments, it said on Monday.

The Portuguese Millennium bcp <BCP.LS> unit said its net profit rose to 143 million zlotys ($45.4 million). Millennium followed suit after Spain's Banco Santander <SAN.MC> local unit BZ WBK <BZW.WA> also showed year-on-year profit growth. [ID:nW8N0JX02A]
