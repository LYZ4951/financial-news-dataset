Feb 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based PT Asuransi Ekspor Indonesia (Persero)'s (ASEI) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating and Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at  'BBB-', respectively. Fitch has also affirmed ASEI's National IFS Rating and  National Long-Term Rating of 'AAA(idn)', respectively. The Outlooks are Stable.  'AAA' National IFS Ratings denote the highest rating assigned within the  national scale for that country. The rating is assigned to the policyholder  obligations of the insurance entities with the lowest credit risk relative to  all other obligations or issuers in the same country, across all industries and  obligation types.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings take into account ASEI's special policy role as the sole provider of  export insurance for the non-oil & gas sector in Indonesia and its 100%  government ownership. ASEI's role is set out under a clause in a decree by  Indonesia's Ministry of Finance that says it will "issue for and on behalf of  the State Export Credit Guarantees and Export Insurance. ASEI has continued to maintain solid capital buffers to support its underwriting  as measured by its risk-based capitalisation (RBC) ratio, which amounted to  566.84% as of end-June 2013 (end-2012: 552%). This is well above the minimum  regulatory requirement of 120%.  ASEI's gross premiums amounted to IDR658.7bn as of end-June 2013, growing in  line with the company's projection. Based on its unaudited financial report,  ASEI's net profit amounted to IDR45.3bn for the financial year ended June 2013,  which was similar to the previous year's result because the improving claims  experience and lower expenses were offset by lower investment returns.
