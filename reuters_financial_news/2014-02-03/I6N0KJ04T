MILAN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The chairman of Fondazione Cariplo, one of the top shareholders in Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, said on Monday he was not informed about any plan for the lender to set up an internal bad bank.

The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Italy's biggest retail bank is working on plans to set up an internal bad bank to house a chunk of its 55 billion euros ($74 billion) of gross non-performing loans ahead of stress tests by the European Central Bank.
