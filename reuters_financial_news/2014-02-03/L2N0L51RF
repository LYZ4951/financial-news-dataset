BRASILIA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's annual inflation rate is expected to have slowed slightly in January as a sharp drop in airfares helped offset an increase in food prices, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

But inflation probably remained far above the midpoint of the central bank's target range which coupled with a recent economic slowdown, paints a challenging outlook for policymakers grappling with a recent bout of volatility in global markets. The benchmark IPCA consumer price index <BRCPIY=ECI> likely rose 5.67 percent in the 12 months through January, down from 5.91 percent at the end of 2013, according to the median forecast of 22 economists. The official inflation target is 4.5 percent, with a tolerance margin of two percentage points. Industrial output probably dropped 1.5 percent in December from the prior month <BRIO=ECI> due to weaker automobile production, according to the median of 24 forecasts. Both readings will be released later this week by Brazil's official statistics agency, the IBGE. On a month-on-month basis, inflation <BRCPI=ECI> probably rose 0.62 percent, the median forecast of 26 survey respondents showed. Forecasts for the January inflation rate ranged from 5.60 percent to 5.73 percent, while estimates for the month-on-month industrial production figures in December ranged from a 0.1 percent expansion to a 3.0 percent decline. IBGE will release both the December industrial output report on Tuesday and the January inflation numbers on Friday at 9 a.m. local time (1100 GMT). "Despite the slowdown in inflation in January, we think prices will remain under pressure throughout the year because of a weaker currency and the increase in real wages over the past few months," analysts at Santander wrote in a research note. Brazil's currency, the real <BRL=X> <BRL=BR>, has weakened nearly 12 percent against the dollar since mid-October. Food inflation likely accelerated last month driven up by higher vegetable, grain and fruit prices, economists at research firm Rosenberg & Associados said in a note to clients. But airfares, which had led inflation upward in December, probably reversed course last month, they added. Stubbornly high inflation has worried investors and prompted Brazil's central bank to raise interest rates seven times since April to their current 10.50 percent <BRCBMP=ECI>. The increase has lifted borrowing costs for the government and businesses, putting 2014's already-meager economic growth prospects at risk just as Dilma Rousseff aims for a second term as president. Inflation has dented consumer spending, one of the few growth engines in Brazil until recently.
