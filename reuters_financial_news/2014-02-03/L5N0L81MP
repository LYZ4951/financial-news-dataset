OSLO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Norwegian households' high debt burden makes them vulnerable to higher interest rates and banks should take this into account in their credit practises, Finance Minister Siv Jensen said Monday.

The International Monetary Fund warned in May that house prices in Norway could be overvalued by as much as 40 percent. "We see that the high debt burden, which now represents more than twice disposable income, makes households vulnerable, that is why it is now very important to remind people that the very low rate level is unlikely to last," Jensen said in a speech at a currency conference. "This is of course also a responsibility of the banks, and they will have to make sure they don't lend out more than customers can pay back, she added." Norway's Financial Supervisory Authority has tightened the rules in recent years to reign in a booming housing market, telling banks to lend no more than 85 percent of the value of homes, down from an earlier 90 percent. But the government has called for a flexible interpretation of the guidelines to make sure that banks don't shut out customers with a good ability to repay their debts. "The challenge is to find a balance between rigid capital demands and ability to pay back the loan," Jensen said. The FSA said last week in a letter to the ministry that banks are indeed being flexible, but also warned that if Norwegian credit growth does not decrease, further measures to reduce credit demand should be considered. Jensen declined to comment on such measures, but will give her formal reply on Friday. DNB, Norway's biggest bank, said the government's call for flexibility had made the bank a bit less strict.
