PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French property group Klepierre <LOIM.PA> posted a 2.2 percent rise in 2013 rental income on like-for-like basis in 2013, overshooting its full-year earnings targets.

The real-estate group, co-owned by Simon Property <SPG.N> and BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, which has been focusing on large retail properties that are expected to provide higher returns, said it completed its 2012-2013 disposal programme worth 1.3 billion euros ($1.76 billion), exceeding its 1-billion target. Klepierre said gross rental income from its mall-focused portfolio grew by 2.5 percent in 2013. Net current cash flow per share grew by 3.8 percent to 2.07 euros, compared to a target of at least 3 percent.
