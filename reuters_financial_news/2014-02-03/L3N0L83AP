SYDNEY, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Australian stocks are set to drop sharply on Tuesday morning, following a slump on Wall Street on surprisingly weak U.S. manufacturing data, while investors also watch for the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting results.

Gold rose more than 1 percent, as worries about global economic growth bolstered an investor flight to safety. * Mining contractor Downer EDI Ltd <DOW.AX> said it was on track to meet its forecast net profit of around A$215 million for the 2014 financial year, after reporting half-year net profit of A$99.1 million, from A$94.0 million a year ago. * Mining firm Cape Lambert Resources <CFE.AX> said it expected to start construction on its flagship Marampa iron ore project in Sierra Leone this year, pledging to employ locals and fund services in the post-conflict African state.
