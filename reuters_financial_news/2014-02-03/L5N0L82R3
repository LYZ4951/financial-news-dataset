TBILISI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has issued its first-ever bond in Armenia's national currency, the dram, in a move to develop the local capital market, the Bank said in a statement.

The EBRD said on Monday that one-year bonds worth 2 billion drams ($5 million) were placed via an auction on the NASDAQ OMX Armenia Exchange in the capital Yerevan on Friday. "This is a very significant step for the Armenian capital market and opens the way for further capital raising in Armenia by those seeking to on-lend Armenian dram to the real economy, thereby ensuring a better fit for borrowers who want to avoid foreign currency risk," said Mark Davis, the head of the EBRD office in Yerevan. Ameriabank CJSC and HSBC Bank Armenia CJSC acted as advisers and agents to the issuer. The securities were the first publicly-auctioned issue by either a foreign borrower or an international financial institution on NASDAQ OMX Armenia Exchange and the first floating rate note to be issued on the local market. The EBRD said issuance of dram-denominated bonds would support the Armenian government's programme of reforms aimed at reducing dollarisation in the economy and stimulating locally-generated savings. The EBRD also plans to issue bonds in the Georgian national currency, the chief of the neighbouring former Soviet state's central bank told Reuters in an interview last week. The EBRD did not comment on its plans in Georgia, but market sources have talked about 1- or 3-year lari bonds worth 50 million lari ($28 million).
