Feb 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that having analysed the relative  difference of the mortgage lending values (MLV) and the respective market values  (MV) for German properties securing commercial mortgage loans in Fitch rated  mortgage Pfandbriefe, the MLVs for properties securing commercial mortgages are  on average 12% lower than the respective MVs, as of March 2013. This figure  differs by property type, size, issuer and the state of economy. The difference between MVs and the MLVs is highest for large office and retail  properties compared to small and moderate-sized properties. Properties with a  granular tenant structure (multifamily and large shopping centres) have lower  cushions that are relatively independent from size.  Fitch says Pfandbriefe are additionally well protected by MV cushions. For  instance, a 12% MV cushion transforms the maximum 60% loan-to-mortgage lending  value (LTMLV) eligibility threshold (Beleihungsgrenze) into an equivalent  loan-to-value limit of 53% for mortgage loans refinanced via Pfandbriefe. This  contributes to high recoveries given default of 70%-90% on mortgage cover pools  in 'AAA' stress scenarios.
