LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog said it issued its first two warning notices in November to bankers for "significant failings" in relation to benchmark interest rate submissions.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) did not name the people. It said it gave a warning notice to a submitter of benchmark interest rates for failings over a period of more than two years, and another warning to a manager at a bank for failings over more than three years.
