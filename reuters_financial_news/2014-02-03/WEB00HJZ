FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Hochtief <HOTG.DE>, the German builder controlled by Spanish group ACS <ACS.MC>, said it agreed to sell its stake in property firm Aurelis and was looking at options for its remaining real estate business.

It said in a statement on Monday that it sold 43 percent of Aurelis to an investor consortium led by private equity firm Grove International Partners LLP, while the remaining 7 percent it held went to an independent investor. It said the sale price was close to the book value as of end-November, without providing further details. Sources had told Reuters last month that Hochtief has received bids for Aurelis and that any deal on the company could be worth 1 billion euros ($1.35 billion). [ID:nL5N0KR2I8]
