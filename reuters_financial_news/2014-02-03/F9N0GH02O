FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The backstops in place to deal with euro zone banks that fail a European Central Bank health check of the sector are sufficient, ECB Vice-President Vitor Constancio said on Monday.

"The backstops are there, (they) are enough," Constancio told reporters at a news conference to give an update on the ECB's plan to check that top euro zone banks have the risks on their balance sheets under control.
