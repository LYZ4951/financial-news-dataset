WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Polish Bank Millennium <MILP> wants to pay out half of its last-year's consolidated profit as dividend, the unit of the loss-making Portuguese Millennium bcp <BCP.LS> said on Monday.

The payout will thus amount to 267 million zlotys ($84.7 million), or 0.22 zlotys per share.
