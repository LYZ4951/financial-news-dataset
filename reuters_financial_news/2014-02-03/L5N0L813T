British banks have set aside 20 billion pounds to compensate customers for payment protection insurance (PPI), the costliest mis-selling scandal in its banking history. PPI policies were supposed to protect borrowers against sickness or redundancy, but were often sold to those who would have been ineligible to claim. Banks have also set aside more than 3 billion pounds to compensate small firms mis-sold risky products designed to insure them against rising interest rates, although they had only paid out 159 million pounds by the end of December.
