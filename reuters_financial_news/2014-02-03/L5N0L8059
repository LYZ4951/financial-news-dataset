DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Union Properties <UPRO.DU>, a Dubai-based real estate developer, said on Monday that its net profit jumped more than eightfold to 1.58 billion dirhams ($430.2 million) last year from 175.8 million dirhams in 2012.

The brief statement did not give a reason for the increase, but companies across Dubai's property sector are booming as the real estate market recovers from its 2008-2010 crash.
