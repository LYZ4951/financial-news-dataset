TOKYO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Shares in SoftBank Corp <9984.T> sagged 7.2 percent on Monday to its lowest since Oct. 10, with traders citing hedge funds cutting their positions on last year's second-best performer in the benchmark Nikkei average <.N225>.

SoftBank nearly tripled in value in 2013, largely on expectations of gains from a planned listing of Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba in which it owns more than 30 percent. It was the most heavily traded stock on the main board on Monday and was heading for its worst one-day decline since June.
