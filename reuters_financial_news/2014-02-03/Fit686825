Feb 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has screened its publicly rated EMEA  corporate universe according to key financial, operational and equity factors to  identify the 50 rated issuers of most interest to potential buyers in the near  term. The report is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking on the link  above. Our analysis focuses primarily on quantitative factors driving M&A, rather than  assessing the likelihood of strategic acquisitions or the existence of potential  acquirers. The list of attractive targets represents companies where we consider  financial performance and credit metrics to be ahead of industry peers, with  multiples below those of peers. The key factors we analysed include sustainable  profitability, cash generation, balance-sheet strength, proven ability to reduce  leverage and current market multiples. The report also discusses M&A trends by market sector. While we expect a slight  uptick in strategic M&A in 2014, opportunistic activity will remain rare,  driving lacklustre overall M&A activity for EMEA corporates in the near term. A  fragile economic recovery in the eurozone and early tapering of the Fed's  quantitative easing programme will likely offset slowly rising enthusiasm  stemming from a gradual market improvement, as well as rising stock markets. However, sector disparities will persist, with rising structural M&A in the  telecoms sector compared with limited activity across pharmaceuticals and  natural resources. The telecoms industry is undergoing high levels of strategic  and structural M&A, primarily due to increasing competitive challenges and high  investment requirements, which drive the need for further industry  consolidation. In western Europe, a successful merger between E-Plus and O2  Germany could strengthen M&A activity in serving as a reference for authorities  in other markets. Activity in the pharmaceutical sector will be affected by the patent cliff,  notably for AstraZeneca plc <AZN.L>, which could embark on mid-large scale acquisitions  for drugs in late-stage development or for established brands. In natural  resources, we anticipate muted M&A in the mining sectors as cash generation will  remain constrained by range-bound commodity prices and lingering demand  pressure. However, the focus of oil and gas majors on boosting reserves and  production capacity provides a springboard for future deal flow.
