BANGKOK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Thailand's main share index rose on Monday after voting in Sunday's general election went ahead peacefully and investors bought back large caps such as Advanced Info Service <ADVA.BK> and Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> to cover short positions.

The benchmark <.SETI> rose 0.9 percent to 1,285.26, in relatively light early volume but analysts said the rise might  be limited. "The market gain was more to do with trading and short-covering," said Teerada Charnyingyong, a strategist at broker Phillip Securiites.
