FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Economic recovery in the euro zone should gain speed due to the European Central Bank's bank health checks, ECB Vice-President Vitor Constancio said on Monday.

"We believe very much that recovery in 2015 will benefit from this exercise," Constancio told reporters at a news conference.
