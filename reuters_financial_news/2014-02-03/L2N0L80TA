TORONTO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index dropped on Monday, led by declines in financial and energy shares as sluggish economic data from China and worries about emerging markets offset positive signals from Europe.

Data showed slower Chinese service sector growth, which hit a five-year low, and weakness in the country's factory sector n January. Investors have been nervous about the prospects for a slowdown in the world second-biggest economy, a concern that has been weighing on other emerging markets.  However, euro zone business surveys indicated that  factories recorded their strongest month since mid-2011 in January, helped by improved hiring and a rebound in Germany. [ID:nL9N0IM04J] The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark index, which recorded a monthly gain in January, was down for a second straight session on Monday. "The China numbers tell me that they haven't gone into freefall, but they've come down and they're still struggling," said Colin Cieszynski, senior market analyst at CMC Markets Canada. "We may just have to get used to a slowing growth rate out of China," he added. The benchmark S&P/TSX composite index <.GSPTSE> was down 122.74 points, or 0.9 percent, at 13,572.20. All of the 10 main sectors on the index were in the red. Financials, the index's most heavily weighted sector, gave back 1 percent. Royal Bank of Canada <RY.TO> fell 1.2 percent to C$68.11, and had the biggest negative influence on the index. Manulife Financial Corp <MFC.TO> lost 2.3 percent to C$20.07. A fall in the price of oil weighed on energy shares. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd <CNQ.TO> declined 1.3 percent to C$36.03. The materials sector, which includes mining stocks, was little changed, with strength in gold-mining shares offset by a drop in diversified miner Teck Resources Ltd <TCKb.TO>. Teck, whose shares fell 2.6 percent to C$26.10, said it was investigating another spill at its Trail smelting complex in British Columbia. It said it does not expect the incident to have a long-term impact on fish or the environment.
