WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Polish Bank Millennium <MILP.WA> expects its 2014 net profit to grow by around 10 percent on the back of the growing economy and private consumption, its chief executive officer said on Monday.

"It is (going to be) a solid increase, between low double digit and high single digit (in percentage terms)," CEO Joao Bras Jorge said.
