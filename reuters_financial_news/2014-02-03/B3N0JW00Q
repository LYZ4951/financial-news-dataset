BUDAPEST, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Hungary will create a law to transform energy services into a non-profit sector, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday, part of a government drive to drastically reduce energy costs to make the economy more competitive.

"We need to create the working conditions for non-profit energy providers in our country," Orban told the opening spring session of parliament. "This requires parliament to create a law on non-profit energy providers on the basis of which the government will have to establish the first Hungarian non-profit energy company." Orban said the European Commission was planning to launch a legal procedure against Hungary over regulated energy prices, which his government cut by 20 percent for households last year and plans to reduce further in the 2014 election year.
