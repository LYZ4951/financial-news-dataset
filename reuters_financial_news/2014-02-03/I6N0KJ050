MILAN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Italian airline Alitalia finalised loan agreements with banks for a total 165 million euros ($223 million), below the 200 million initially sought, that will keep it flying while it searches for a new partner, two sources close to the matter said on Monday.

The loans are part of a government-stitched emergency package put together last year to give the troubled airline enough cash while it restructures and finalises talks with Etihad Airways on a possible investment. "Alitalia has asked for 200 million and we have come down to 165 million, a sufficient sum to plug the gap until Etihad makes a decision," one of the sources said.
