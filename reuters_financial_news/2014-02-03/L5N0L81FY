WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Polish medical equipment maker Medicalgorithmics <MDG.WA> has moved its listing to Warsaw's main exchange from the junior NewConnect, aiming to raise its profile among investors and increase its credibility given higher disclosure standards.

Shares in the company, a maker of equipment for monitoring cardiac arrhythmia, backtracked from recent gains to be down 1.5 percent at 269 zlotys by 1024. The stock had risen sharply ahead of the planned move, touching a peak of 285 zlotys late last month. As recently as a year ago the shares were valued at around 67 zlotys apiece, but the recent advance has inflated the company's total stock market value to some 940 million zlotys ($298.2 million). That is despite the company having chalked up sales of just 11 million zlotys in the first three quarters of 2013 and a net profit of 8 million. Around 90 percent of the company's revenue comes from the United States. Medicalgorithmics' main product is Pocket ECG, a mobile device collecting patients' cardiac data and sending it to medical centres, where the data is assessed by doctors.
