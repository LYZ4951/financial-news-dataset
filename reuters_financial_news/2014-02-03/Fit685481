Feb 3 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Draco (Eclipse 2005-4)  plc's class E notes due 2017 as follows: GBP3.4m class E (XS0238141617): affirmed at 'CCCsf', Recovery Estimate (RE) 90%  Draco (Eclipse 2005-4) plc is a securitisation of five commercial mortgage loans  originated in the UK by Barclays Bank plc [BARCR.UL]. Four loans have prepaid since closing  in December 2005, leaving the loan pool with a current balance of GBP7.9m as at  the January 2014 interest payment date.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The GBP144.1m Flintstone loan (95% of the pool balance) has, over the past 12  months, been repaid in full, ahead of its maturity in October 2015. The  redemption triggered the sequential principal allocation to the notes, resulting  in the full repayment of the class A to D notes at the January 2014 interest  payment date. The remaining loan, GBP7.9m Herbert House, is secured by a single-tenanted  secondary office property located in Birmingham city centre. The building is  fully let to Cable and Wireless Communications with a lease break in July 2015.  As per Fitch's expectation, the loan defaulted at its maturity on 7 January 2014  and was transferred to special servicing (performed by Capita Asset Services).  Uncertainty surrounding the future income profile is reflected in the July 2012  market value of GBP5.2m, down from GBP11.2m in September 2005.  In the event that the lease break is exercised, even the vacant possession value  of GBP3.2m may not be achievable given the poor condition of the property and  required capital expenditure. In addition, the property has unsuccessfully been  marketed by the borrower since November 2012 at an asking price in excess of  GBP8.5m. Due to the combined effect of the state of repair and the fact that net  rental income is higher than the estimated rental value by 52%, Fitch expects  the loan recoveries to be insufficient to repay the class E notes in full. This  is reflected in the recovery estimate of 90%.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The class E notes may be repaid in full should the tenant not exercise its break  option. The additional 10 years of income would sufficiently increase the value  of the asset (and the appeal to investors) to avoid a default. In this scenario,  an upgrade would be possible.
