MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's benchmark BSE index fell 1.6 percent on Monday to mark its lowest close in nearly 2-1/2 months as blue chips such as ICICI Bank slumped on risk aversion amid little sign that emerging market woes have abated.

ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> fell 2.6 percent, while Tata Motors Ltd <TAMO.NS> lost 3.6 percent. The BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally fell 1.56 percent, marking its lowest close since Nov. 13. The NSE index <.NSEI> lost 1.44 percent.
