MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian hypermarket chain Lenta, part-owned by U.S. private equity firm TPG, [TPG.UL], said on Monday it intends to float in London, tapping demand from investors for consumer-focused stocks buoyed by a rising middle class.

The move could produce a rare success story for a U.S. buyout firm in Russia, giving TPG the opportunity to partly exit an investment it made in 2009.
