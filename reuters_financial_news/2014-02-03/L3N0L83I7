Feb 3 (Reuters) - Insurer Hartford Financial Services Group <HIG.N> posted a profit in the fourth quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss, helped by lower disaster losses.

The company's net income was $314 million, or 65 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $46 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter was impacted by losses from superstorm Sandy, which hit New York and New Jersey in October 2012.
