PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - France's Vivendi <VIV.PA> said it had agreed to accept cable company Numericable's <NUME.PA> bid for its SFR telecom business, worth at least 17 billion euros ($23.3 billion) in total, over rival bidder Bouygues <BOUY.PA>.

Vivendi said in a statement on Saturday its supervisory board had unanimously voted to retain Numericable's offer, which promised a first payment of 13.5 billion euros, a separate 750 million euro payment and finally the possibility for Vivendi to own and then sell a 20 percent stake in the new entity.
