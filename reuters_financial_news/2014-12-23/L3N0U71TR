BANGKOK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets posted modest gains on Tuesday, with buying strong in banking and consumer-related shares, but energy stocks were hurting as investors went for quick gains amid oil price volatility.

Malaysia's index <.KLSE> was up 0.5 percent at 1,752.19, the highest since Dec. 11, after four days of gains. Indonesia <.JKSE> rose 0.5 percent after Monday's slip and the Philippines <.PSI> ticked up 0.7 percent, its fourth straight rise. Shares of Malaysia's Public Bank <PUBM.KL> climbed 1.6 percent, Indonesia's Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> rose 0.7 percent and Philippine Long Distance Telephone <TEL.PS> jumped 3 percent. Banking shares such as United Overseas Bank <UOBH.SI> and Bangkok Bank <BBL.BK> also outperformed the broader markets in Singapore and Thailand respectively. Brokers in Bangkok said money shifted to dividend-yielding stocks, while buying interest from domestic institutions could further lift the market. "We view any market dips as an opportunity to accumulate positions in big-cap names like Kbank, BBL ... to bet on year-end institutional window dressing," broker Phillip Securities said in a report. Thailands' SET index <.SETI> fell 0.4 percent due to selling in large-cap energy stocks such as PTT <PTT.BK> and PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK>. Energy-related shares also led the declines elsewhere, with Malaysia's UMW Oil and Gas Corp <UMOG.KL> down 3 percent and Singapore's Keppel Corp <KPLM.SI> off 0.9 percent.
