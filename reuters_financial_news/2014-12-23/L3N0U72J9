BANGKOK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets edged higher on Tuesday, with Philippines extending gains to a more than one-week high ahead of market holidays, but the Thai benchmark bucked the trend amid weakness in energy stocks.

The Philippine main index <.PSI> rose 0.7 percent to finish at 7,186.32, its highest close since Dec. 15, and a slight gain of 0.9 percent on the week. Shares of oil refiner Petron Corp <PCOR.PS> jumped 5 percent and was the best performer on the main index, boosted by foreign inflows, exchange data showed. The Philippine stock market is closed on Wednesday through Friday for the Christmas holidays. Normal trading resumes on Monday. [ID:nL3N0U726Q] Singapore <.FTSTI> and Malaysia <.KLSE> both rose for a fifth session, Indonesia <.JKSE> rebounded from a fall on Monday, while Vietnam <.VNI> ended slightly higher. The Thai SET index <.SETI> ended down 0.4 percent as investors cashed in on recent gains in large-cap energy shares amid volatility in oil prices, with PTT Exploration and Production <PTTEP.BK> falling 3.3 percent after a 4.3 percent rise on Monday. Brent crude steadied around $60 a barrel on Tuesday, under pressure from a supply glut but supported by forecasts of stronger economic data from the United States. [O/R]
