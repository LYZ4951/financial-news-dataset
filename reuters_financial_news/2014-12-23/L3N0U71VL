HANOI, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's credit growth this year is expected to quicken slightly to 13 percent, in line with its annual target, after an expansion of 12.52 percent in 2013, a senior central banker said on Tuesday.

The country is expected to post a surplus of $11 billion in its balance of payments this year, Do Thi Nhung, deputy head of the State Bank of Vietnam's Monetary Policy Department, told a news conference.
