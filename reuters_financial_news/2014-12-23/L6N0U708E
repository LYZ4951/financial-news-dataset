DUBAI, Dec 23 (Reuters) - A renewed pull-back in oil prices may encourage profit-taking in Gulf stock markets on Tuesday and end their recent rebound,  temporarily at least.

After jumping to almost $63 a barrel on Monday, Brent crude slid back to not much over $60 after Saudi Arabia's oil minister said OPEC would not cut production at any price. [ID:nL3N0U71DX] The stabilisation of oil prices was a major factor behind Gulf bourses' recovery since late last week, so the possibility of oil again testing $60 means equities' upward momentum looks set to fade.  Although most markets rose on Monday, their gains slowed and turnover, while still active, fell from Sunday's high levels - signs of waning momentum. The recent rebound has not turned markets technically bullish, as they remain below downtrend lines and 100- and 200-day averages.
