NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with both the Dow and S&P 500 building on a four-day rally to set new intraday records after an unexpectedly strong report on economic growth.

The gains pushed the Dow over 18,000 for the first time in its history, with the index reaching a high of 18,020.19.  The final estimate of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter was revised up to a 5 percent annual pace, its quickest in 11 years, from 3.9 percent reported last month, on stronger consumer and business spending, the government said. The report easily topped expectations calling for a 4.3 percent pace. [ID:nLNNNNEA58] "That is a solid number, that is really what you want to see, you want to see it in demand," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.  "That is a huge plus, a five handle on GDP is astounding to me, but I'm not going to turn it away - Merry Christmas."  However, durable goods orders unexpectedly fell 0.7 percent in November, well short of expectations for an increase of 2.9 percent. Non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, was unchanged after a downwardly revised 1.9 percent drop in October. [ID:nLNNNNEA59] Major Wall Street indexes have risen for four straight sessions, pushing the benchmark S&P index  <.SPX> to its 50th record high of the year. The S&P has risen 5.4 percent over that period, its best 4-day run since July 2010. The rally comes on the heels of a selloff, sparked by a slump in oil prices that saw the index drop nearly 5 percent from its prior record high set on Dec. 5.   The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 41.69 points, or 0.23 percent, to 18,001.13, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 5.77 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,084.31 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 5.49 points, or 0.11 percent, to 4,786.92.

Trading volume is expected to be light this week due to the Christmas holiday, which could increase volatility. U.S. equity markets will open for an abbreviated session Wednesday and be closed on Thursday.
