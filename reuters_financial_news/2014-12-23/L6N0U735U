MILAN, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Italy's third largest lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> said on Tuesday it had settled a tax dispute over a  trade known as Chianti Classico in a deal that has a "substantially neutral" economic impact.

Monte Paschi said it would pay around 126 million euros ($153 million) but because of capital allowances stemming from the settlement scheme with Italy's tax agency, the impact on results and CET 1 capital adequacy ratio would be neutral. In a statement, Monte Paschi said it decided to settle the dispute to avoid a possible lengthy and uncertain legal fight but remained convinced it had acted correctly.
