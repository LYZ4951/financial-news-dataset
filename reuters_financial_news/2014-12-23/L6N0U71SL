MOSCOW, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The Russian government told large state exporting companies on Tuesday that by March 1 they must bring their net foreign exchange assets back to the levels of Oct. 1.

The government said in a statement on its website that the instructions had been given to gas firm Gazprom <GAZP.MM>, oil firm Rosneft <ROSN.MM>, diamond miners Alrosa and Kristall, and oil company Zarubezhneft.
