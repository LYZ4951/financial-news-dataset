HANOI, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's credit growth is projected to pick up in 2015 to between 13-15 percent to accommodate faster economic growth, compared with 13 percent this year, the central bank said on Tuesday.

Annual inflation this year could slow to a maximum 2 percent or stay below that rate, beating an earlier government projection, Nguyen Thi Hong, a deputy governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, told a news conference. Last month, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said Vietnam was expected to keep the annual inflation rate this year below 3 percent. [ID:nL3N0T92XF]
