LJUBLJANA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Slovenia should press on with plans to privatise its banks to ensure their long-term stability and avoid having to sell them off cheaply at a later date, the Bank of Slovenia Governor Bostjan Jazbec said on Tuesday.

Slovenia narrowly avoided an international bailout last year after the euro zone country poured more than 3 billion euros ($3.67 billion) into its banks to prevent them from collapsing under a pile of bad loans. Most of the country's banks are still state-owned because Slovenia has been reluctant to sell them until now. Jazbec, who also sits on the European Central Bank's governing council, urged the government to sell the country's second largest bank Nova KBM (NKBM) in 2015 and merge state-owned banks Abanka and Banka Celje as planned.
