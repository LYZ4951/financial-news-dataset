NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - A sudden surge in the shares of Targa Resources Partners LP <NGLS.N> shortly after the start of trading on Tuesday was the result of "clearly erroneous" trades, Nasdaq and Direct Edge said, and the two exchanges are investigating the incident.

Shares of the natural gas processor and transporter briefly spiked to as high as $10,102.42 between 9:33 a.m. and 9:34 a.m. EST (1433-1434 GMT), before falling back to trade down 1 percent at $45.90. The spread between potential buyers' posted bid prices and sellers' asking price mushroomed during that minute, with the asking price at one point topping $12,000 even as the bid held steady at around $47.
