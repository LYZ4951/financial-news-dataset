VIENNA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service downgraded by one notch on Tuesday the deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings of Raiffeisen Bank International's <RBIV.VI> Russian unit ZAO Raiffeisenbank and put its ratings on review for a downgrade.

It cited "materially increased risks to earnings and capital" at ZAO Raiffeisenbank given substantial  deterioration in the Russian operating environment and heightened risk of a more prolonged and more acute economic downturn than originally anticipated. "In particular, Moody's expects that the recent hike in interest rates and substantial local-currency devaluation will trigger a deterioration in ZAO Raiffeisenbank's financial fundamentals," it added.
