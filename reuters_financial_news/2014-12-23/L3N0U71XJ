MANILA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Conglomerate SM Investments Corp <SM.PS> said it had sold a portion of its stake in BDO Unibank Inc <BDO.PS> to Khazanah Nasional Bhd [KHAZA.UL], marking the entry of Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund in the Philippines' top lender by assets.

SM, owned by the Philippines' richest man, Henry Sy, said in a statement on Tuesday the transaction involved its unit, Multi-Realty Development Corp, selling 2 percent of BDO's total common shares to Pulau Kaca Investments Ltd, a Khazanah unit. SM did not disclose financial details. BDO currently has a market value of $8.75 billion. SM said the entry of Khazanah will further strengthen the BDO's institutional shareholder base and affirms the attractiveness of the Philippines as an investment destination.
