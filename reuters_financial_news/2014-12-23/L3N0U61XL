HONG KONG, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Chinese real estate developer Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co Ltd <3699.HK> are set for a flat trading debut in Hong Kong on Tuesday as concerns about debt and a high valuation offset optimism over a rebound in China's property market.

Dalian Wanda raised about $3.7 billion after pricing the deal near the top of a HK$41.80 to HK$49.60 per share marketing range. [ID:nL3N0U01XP].
