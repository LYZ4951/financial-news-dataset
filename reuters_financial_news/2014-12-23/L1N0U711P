Dec 23 (Reuters) - About 6.4 million Americans have enrolled for individual insurance plans for 2015 through HealthCare.gov, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Tuesday.

HealthCare.gov sells individual plans created by the national healthcare reform law in 36 states. The rest of the states, including California and New York, have their own online exchanges and those figures are not included in these latest numbers.
