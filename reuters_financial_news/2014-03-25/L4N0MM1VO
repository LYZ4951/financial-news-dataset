NEW DELHI, March 25 (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court will resume hearing on Wednesday a petition filed by the head of the Sahara group seeking his release from custody.

Sahara Chairman Subrata Roy, 65, was arrested on Feb. 28 after failing to appear at a contempt hearing in a long-running legal battle between the group and the Indian securities regulator over refund of billions of dollars to investors in outlawed bonds.
