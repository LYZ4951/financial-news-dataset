STOCKHOLM, March 25 (Reuters) - Swedish construction firm SEFA aims to list its shares on the Stockholm stock exchange in the autumn of 2015 to facilitate rapid growth, the company's chief executive and main owner Ola Serneke said on Tuesday.

Gothenburg-based SEFA, which was founded by Serneke and a former companion in 2002, had sales of around 1.2 billion Swedish crowns ($186.66 million) last year. "We will probably have a turnover of around 2 billion in 2014 but we want to increase it even more to 10 billion in 2020," Serneke told Reuters. "More equity is required in order to fight for bridge projects and so on." SEFA aims to go public on the Nasdaq OMX midcap list and hopes to raise somewhere in the range of 500 million to 1 billion Swedish crowns, the CEO said, adding that the firm's equity currently amounts to around 390 million crowns. Serneke, whose customers include municipalities, state owned companies and industrials, regards the much larger Swedish construction firms Skanska <SKAb.ST>, NCC <NCCb.ST> and Peab <PEABb.ST> as SEFA's top competitors. Skanska had revenues of 136 billion Swedish crowns in 2013, while NCC had 58 billion and Peab recorded sales of 43 billion. Serneke holds a majority stake in SEFA, while other owners include employees and some outside investors.
