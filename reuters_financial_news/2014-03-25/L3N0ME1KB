SHANGHAI, March 25 (Reuters) - Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (AgBank) <601288.SS> <1288.HK> posted on Tuesday a 12.8 percent rise in its fourth-quarter net profit, in line with estimates, helped by strong growth in fee and commission income.

Net profit for the quarter rose to 28.22 billion yuan ($4.57 billion) from 25.014 billion yuan in the same 2012 period. That compares with an average estimate of 29.0 billion yuan according to nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. For the full year, net profit rose 14.6 percent to 166.3 billion yuan from 145.1 billion yuan in 2012, China's third-largest lender said in its earnings statement.  AgBank's non-performing loan ratio fell slightly to 1.22 percent at end-December 2013 from 1.24 percent at end-September.
