March 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the National Long-Term ratings of five Thai subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks. United Overseas Bank (Thai) Public Company Limited (UOBT), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Thai) Public Company Limited (ICBCT) and ICBC (Thai) Leasing  Company Limited (ICBCTL) have been affirmed at 'AAA(tha)'; Maybank Kim Eng  Securities (Thailand) Public Company Limited <MBKET.BK> (MBKET) affirmed at 'AA(tha)' and  CIMB Thai Bank Public Company Limited <CIMBT.BK> (CIMBT) affirmed at 'AA-(tha)'. The  Outlooks are Stable, except for the rating on MBKET, which has a Negative  Outlook. Fitch has also affirmed UOBT's and CIMBT's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at  'A-' and 'BBB', respectively. A full list of rating actions is included at the  end of this commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The National ratings of UOBT, ICBCT, MBKET, and CIMBT, as well as the IDRs and  Support Ratings of UOBT and CIMBT, reflect Fitch's belief of a high probability  of extraordinary support, if required, from their respective parent banks,  United Overseas Bank Limited <UOBH.SI> (UOB; AA-/Stable), Industrial and Commercial Bank  of China <601398.SS> (ICBC; A/Stable), Malayan Banking Berhad <MBBM.KL> (Maybank; A-/Negative), and CIMB Bank Berhad [BUCMO.UL] (CIMB). Fitch considers the Thai subsidiaries to be  strategically important to the parents due to the high levels of operational  integration, past histories of financial support and near-full ownership.  The National ratings of ICBCTL reflect Fitch's view that it is a core subsidiary  of ICBCT. ICBCTL has a key role in implementing the bank's retail strategy and  its contribution to the bank is substantial. ICBCTL accounted for 38% of ICBCT's  consolidated loan portfolio as of end-2013.  The Outlooks for UOBT, ICBCT, ICBCTL, and MBKET are consistent with that of  their parents. The Stable Outlook for CIMBT reflects Fitch's expectation that  the parent bank's ability and propensity to provide extraordinary support to  CIMBT is unlikely to change over the next one to two years.  UOBT's Viability Rating (VR) of 'bb+' reflects its modest (though improving)  domestic franchise, and weaker funding and profitability compared with  higher-rated Thai banks. It also takes into consideration UOBT's sound risk  management culture and effective system (supported by UOB), as well as UOBT's  strong capital position. CIMBT's VR of 'bb-' is based on its limited franchise, as well as relatively  weaker asset quality and capitalisation indicators compared with local and  international peers. There have been some improvements in key financial  measures, and Fitch expects CIMBT's overall credit profile to remain in line  with similarly rated peers.  CIMBT's Thai baht-denominated subordinated Upper Tier 2 debt is currently rated  two notches below CIMBT's National Long-term Rating, based on the debt's  subordination and coupon deferral feature. Its subordinated unsecured debt  (Lower Tier 2) is rated one notch below. The notching for these debts  instruments reflects their subordination in the capital structure and is in line  with Fitch's rating approach for such instruments.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - National Ratings, IDRs and Support Ratings Negative rating action on the IDRs on UOB, ICBC, and Maybank could lead to  similar action on their subsidiaries' ratings. A material change in the parent  banks' ability and/ or propensity to support their Thai subsidiaries could also  have an impact on the subsidiaries' ratings. For example, a significant  reduction in group shareholding in the subsidiary could result in negative  rating action.  A material improvement in CIMB's credit profile may result in an upgrade of  CIMBT's IDRs and National Ratings; conversely a significant deterioration may  result in downgrades.   Since UOBT's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR is constrained by Thailand's 'A-'  country ceiling, any changes in the country ceiling could lead to complementary  movements at UOBT's IDR.  The National Long-Term Ratings for UOBT, ICBCT, and ICBCTL are already the  highest on the national scale, and hence there is no upside. An upgrade of  Thailand's Long-Term Local-Currency IDR, while ICBC's ratings remain unchanged,  may result in a downgrade of ICBCT's and ICBCTL's National Ratings.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - Viability Ratings  There is potential upside to UOBT's VR, if it can show further sustainable  improvement in profitability that comes from prudent growth rather than  increased risk appetite. However, the scope for upside would remain limited as  long as key ratios remain modest compared with international peers'. Meanwhile,  a significant worsening in performance that impacts capitalisation and asset  quality could put downward pressure on UOBT's VR.   CIMBT's VR could be positively affected by material and sustained improvements  in its overall financial strength compared with peers'. This may be visible  through key financial measures such as asset quality, liquidity and capital.  There could be downside to the VR if there is a major deterioration in financial  performance and a weakening of capital ratios to below peer averages. However,  Fitch does not expect any shifts to occur imminently.  UOB has a 99.7% stake in UOBT. CIMB has a 93.7% stake in CIMBT. ICBCT is  97.7%-owned by ICBC. ICBCTL is 99.99%-owned by ICBCT. MBKET is 83.5% owned by  the Maybank group. UOBT is the eighth largest commercial bank in Thailand, CIMBT  is the 10th largest, and ICBCT is the 13th largest, in terms of total assets as  of end-2013.
