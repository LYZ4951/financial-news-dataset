WASHINGTON, March 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department is poised to approve the first trans-Atlantic flight of Lockheed Martin Corp's <LMT.N> F-35 fighter jet in July, when the new warplane is expected to take part in two international air shows near London, according to multiple sources familiar with the issue.

U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is "very close" to a decision that would allow two or three F-35s to fly at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), an annual military air show held outside London, and the larger Farnborough air show, held every two years, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
