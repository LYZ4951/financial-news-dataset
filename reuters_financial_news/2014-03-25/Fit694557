March 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Bank of Ceylon's [BKCEY.UL] (BOC) Long-Term Foreign Currency and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'BB-' with a Stable Outlook. The agency has also affirmed BOC's Viability Rating (VR) at 'b+'. BOC's National Long-Term rating has also been  affirmed at 'AA+(lka)' with a Stable Outlook. A full list of rating actions is  at the end of this rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND DEBT BOC's IDRs and National Long-Term rating reflect the government of Sri Lanka's  (BB-/Stable) high propensity but moderate ability to provide support to the bank  under extraordinary situations. The state's high propensity stems from BOC's  high systemic importance as the largest bank in Sri Lanka, its quasi-sovereign  status, its role as a key lender to the government and full government  ownership. The state's moderate ability to provide support is reflected in the  sovereign rating. The Stable Outlook on BOC's IDRs and National Long-Term rating reflects the  Stable Outlook on Sri Lanka's sovereign rating. The US dollar senior unsecured notes are rated at the same level as BOC's  Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR as they constitute direct, unsubordinated and  unsecured obligations of the bank, and rank equally with all its other unsecured  and unsubordinated obligations.  BOC's Sri Lanka rupee-denominated subordinated debt is rated one notch below its  National Long-Term rating to reflect its gone-concern loss-absorption quality in  the event of liquidation.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND DEBT Any change in Sri Lanka's sovereign rating or the perception of state support to  BOC could result in a change in BOC's IDRs, National Long-Term rating, and issue  ratings. Visible demonstration of preferential support for BOC in the form of an  explicit guarantee will be instrumental to an upgrade of its National Long-Term  rating  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VIABILITY RATING  The bank's VR remains under pressure due to its thin capitalisation and  declining asset quality. The VR also takes into consideration BOC's strong  domestic funding franchise that is underpinned by its state linkages. Increased delinquencies in BOC's gold backed loans portfolio, which expanded  rapidly since 2010, have been the main contributor to the increase in  non-performing loans (NPL), a phenomenon that has been seen across the sector.  BOC has concentration risk arising from high exposure to the state sector (state  and state-owned entities). Of the bank's total state sector exposure at  end-2013, about 40% is guaranteed by the state. Reported Tier 1 regulatory capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 8.0% at  end-2013 and benefited from exposures that are zero-risk weighted according to  local regulatory requirements. If risk weights of 100% and 50% were applied on  foreign currency denominated state sector and gold backed exposures  respectively, BOC's Tier 1 CAR would be much lower. The pace of loan growth  slowed to 6% in 2013 from 27% a year earlier. This supported a reduction in the  loans-to-deposits ratio to 91% at end-2013 from 105% at end-2012.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - VR  A continued decline in capitalisation through a surge in lending or a further  decline in asset quality alongside high dividend payouts could place downward  pressure on the bank's VR.  A timely capital infusion would support the VR.  BOC is the largest bank in Sri Lanka in terms of assets. BOC has 13 subsidiaries  and five associates and has branches in Chennai, India, Male, Maldives and the  Seychelles: and a fully owned subsidiary, Bank of Ceylon (UK) Ltd, in the UK.
