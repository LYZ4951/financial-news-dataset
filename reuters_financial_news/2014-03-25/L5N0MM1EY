Encouraging updates from companies such as Europe's largest home improvements retailer Kingfisher <KGF.L> and British budget airline easyJet <EZJ.L> also improved market sentiment.  The biggest sectoral gainers were basic resources stocks <.SXPP>, which rose 1.3 percent, with analysts saying that any monetary easing by the world's No. 1 metals consumer would support metal prices as well as improving mining sector profits. "The stimulus talk is around and could certainly help markets to recover. If we see any relaxation on the monetary front, then this could mean that we see some relief in the commodity space," Gerhard Schwarz, head of equity strategy at Baader Bank, said. "We saw cyclical sectors underperforming over the last couple of weeks and any kind of stimulus will certainly help the cyclical sectors more." Global diversified miners Rio Tinto <RIO.L> and BHP Billiton <BLT.L> rose 2.1 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, while Anglo American <AAL.L> rose 1.9 percent. Miners helped the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares to gain 0.7 percent to 1,302.68 points by 0840 GMT after falling more than 1 percent in the previous session. However, investors stayed cautious in trading as geopolitical tension between Russia and the West persisted.  U.S. President Barack Obama and major industrialised allies warned Russia on Monday it faced damaging economic sanctions if President Vladimir Putin takes further action to destabilise Ukraine following the seizure of Crimea.
