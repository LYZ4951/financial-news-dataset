MILAN, March 25 (Reuters) - Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> is set to raise 1 billion euros through the sale of a five-year senior unsecured bond that drew orders worth more than 3 billion euros, a source with direct knowledge of the deal and a market source said on Tuesday.

The bank has lowered the yield guidance on the bond to 275-280 basis points over the corresponding mid-swap rate from around 290 basis points initially, the sources said. The books closed at 1100 GMT, one source said.
