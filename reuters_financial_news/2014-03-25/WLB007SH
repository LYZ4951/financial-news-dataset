LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Troubled British insurer RSA <RSA.L> set out its plans for a fully underwritten rights issue on Tuesday, to raise 773 million pounds ($1.27 billion) to restore its capital position.

RSA, which reported a 244 million pound pretax loss for 2013 after it suffered an accounting scandal at its Irish business and large weather-related claims, said it would launch a 3 for 8 rights issue at 56 pence per share.
