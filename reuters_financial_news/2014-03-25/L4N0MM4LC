March 25 (Reuters) - Mobile game maker King Digital Entertainment Plc's <KING.N> IPO was priced at $22.50 per share, which could value the maker of "Candy Crush Saga" at more than $7 billion, the Wall Street Journal said, quoting a person familiar with the matter.

King's expected offering of 22.2 million shares would raise about $500 million at that price, which is at the mid-point of its planned $21-$24 price range, the Journal said. (http://link.reuters.com/nar87v)
