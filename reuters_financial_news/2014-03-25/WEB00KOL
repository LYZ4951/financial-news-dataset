ZURICH, March 25 (Reuters) - Julius Baer <BAER.VX> said on Tuesday it had acquired a majority stake in Brazilian wealth manager GPS as it looks to increase its presence in Latin America's largest wealth management market.

The Swiss private bank increased it holding in GPS Investimentos Financeiros e Participações S.A to 80 percent from the 30 percent it bought in May 2011, it said in a statement.
