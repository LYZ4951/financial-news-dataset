LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - European stocks edged higher on Tuesday, led by British-listed airline EasyJet <EZJ.L> after a outlook upgrade, although gains were kept in check by expectations of tepid data from Germany.

The British budget airline, up 3.7 percent, upgraded its first-half outlook, saying it now expected a first-half loss similar to last year's level as it kept a lid on costs. [ID:nWLB007SK] The stock was the top riser on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index, which was up 0.3 percent at 1,297.98 points at 0802 GMT, taking its cue from a late recovery on Wall Street.
