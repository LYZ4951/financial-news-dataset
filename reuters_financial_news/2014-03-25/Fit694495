March 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Malaysian  Reinsurance Berhad's (Malaysian Re) Insurer Financial Strength rating (IFS) at  'A'. The Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation takes into consideration Malaysian Re's healthy financial  fundamentals, as manifested by its sustained premium growth, consistently  healthy financial performance and solid market franchise in Malaysia. The rating  is constrained by the limited geographical diversification in its business  portfolio, potential catastrophe exposure from its foreign businesses, and  strong market competition in Malaysia and overseas. Malaysian Re's rating is not  currently constrained by Malaysia's 'A' Local Currency IDR, but Fitch does not  expect Malaysian Re to be rated by more than one notch above than Malaysia's  Local Currency IDR. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Malaysian Re will maintain  its sound financial performance, with the management placing strong emphasis on  bottom-line profitability as opposed to mere top-line growth. Malaysian Re is Malaysia's largest reinsurer by premium income. Fitch expects  its market dominance to remain solid, given its strongly entrenched market  positioning and franchise as well as continued support from local cedants. The  company actively participates in various local industry initiatives, which has  helped to foster strong business relationships with local insurers. The company  had a market share of about 57.6% in 2012, based on industry estimates. Its  average market share has been about 60% since 2007.  Malaysian Re's combined ratio was 94% for the financial year ended 31 March 2013  (FY13), a slight improvement from 96% for FY12. Based on preliminary figures for  9M13, net income is estimated to have totalled MYR117.5m, from MYR96.9m a year  earlier. Its regulatory risk-based capital ratio was above 200% at end-December  2013, well in excess of the regulatory minimum of 130%. Malaysian Re estimated  that its claims exposure pertaining to the missing airplane used on Malaysia  Airlines' flight MH370 is likely to be manageable because its exposure is capped  by its retrocession programme.   RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade is unlikely for the company in the near term. However, key rating  triggers that could lead to an upgrade include a significant sustained  improvement in the reinsurer's credit profile, with the combined ratio falling  consistently below 94% and the regulatory capital ratio above 220%.  Key rating triggers for a downgrade are significant deterioration in the  reinsurer's credit profile in terms of market franchise, premium sustainability,  operating performance and capital levels relative to its business profile, with  the combined ratio increasing above 105%, or the regulatory capital ratio  falling below 180% for an extended period.
