RABAT, March 25 (Reuters) - Morocco's central bank cut banks' reserve requirement to 2 percent from 4 percent on Tuesday, citing a shortage of liquidity, the bank's governor, Abdellatif Jouahri, said.

"We are ready to cut it to zero if the market needs that," the governor told a news conference after the bank's quarterly policy meeting. The bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 3 percent, forecasting inflation would stay in line with its medium-term target.
