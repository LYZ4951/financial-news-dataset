TOKYO, March 25 (Reuters) - Asian Development Bank (ADB) may slightly lower its projection of Japan's economic growth for 2014 due to tepid growth in the October-December quarter, President Takehiko Nakao said on Tuesday.

The Manila-based institution forecast in December that the world's third-largest economy would grow 1.6 percent in 2014. It is due to update growth forecasts for Asia next week.
