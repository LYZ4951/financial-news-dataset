BUDAPEST, March 25 (Reuters) - Hungary's rate-cutting cycle will come to a halt if sentiment on international financial markets worsens significantly, the central bank said on Tuesday, signalling for the first time that the end of its steady monthly cuts was near.

The National Bank of Hungary cut its base rate by 10 basis points earlier on Tuesday to a record low of 2.6 percent<NBHI>, delivering its 20th monthly rate reduction in a row. "Considering the substantial reduction in interest rates so far, changes in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy and based on currently available information, the... base rate has significantly approached a level which ensures the medium-term achievement of price stability and a corresponding degree of support for the economy," the bank said in a statement.
