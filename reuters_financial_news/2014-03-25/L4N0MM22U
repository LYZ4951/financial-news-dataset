HONG KONG. March 25 (Reuters) - China Life Insurance Co Ltd <601628.SS> and its parent China Life Insurance (Group) Company (CLIC) will inject 7 billion yuan into the firm's property and casualty insurance subsidiary, according to an exchange filing in Hong Kong on Tuesday.

China Life <2628.HK> and CLIC will pay 2.8 billion and 4.2 billion yuan respectively in cash for shares in the subsidiary, China Life Property and Casualty Insurance Company Ltd. The investment is to fund growth in the subsidiary as China's non-life insurance market expands, China Life said in the statement.  China Life and CLIC maintain their respective 40 and 60 percent ownership stakes in the subsidiary, the companies said. China Life is due to report its financial results for 2013 later on Tuesday.
