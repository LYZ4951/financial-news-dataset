LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> expects UK regulators to require banks to hold a common equity tier 1 requirement of around 11 percent under normal market conditions, Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio told a conference in London.

Horta-Osorio said capital requirements in Europe and the United Kingdom were becoming better defined. The Prudential Regulation Authority sets a minimum requirement of 7 percent but investors generally expect a ratio of 10 percent. Speaking at the same Morgan Stanley conference, Royal Bank of Scotland's <RBS.L> Chief Executive Ross McEwan reiterated a target for its Irish business Ulster Bank to move back into profitability in 2014.
