OSLO, March 25 (Reuters) - Norway's BW Offshore <BWO.OL>, a provider of ships that pump and store oil, expects the current strong market to last a decade as new offshore fields are developed by oil firms, Chief Financial Officer Knut Saetre told Reuters on Tuesday.

BW Offshore is the world's second largest contractor with a fleet of 14 floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSO) and 1 floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) operating globally. On Tuesday, BW Offshore signed an interim agreement with Addax Petroleum Exploration Ltd, an affiliate of Sinopec, for a six year extension offshore Nigeria for the FPSO Sendje Berge. "We experience a very hectic market and find ourselves in a good position where we unfortunately have to turn down certain projects," Saetre said. "We think it looks bright for 2014 as well as the next five to ten years to come." Even tough many oil firms have curtailed investment programmes, there are still many projects that are under development, he added. "In our segment, we see a very good market balance where the demand actually outpaces supply," Saetre said. With the exception of the FPSO Abo, which is also located offshore Nigeria, all of BW Offshore's units are now on long term contracts, even if the Sendje Berge extension came after lengthy negotiations. "We have been working on this for a very long time. We have been doing this for two years really. Our firm contract expired a year ago and after that we have had short extensions for periods of three to six months," Saetre said. The Abo unit's firm contract lasts only until June, but will likely stay put for years to come. "We hope we can get a longer time horizon on this contract in 2014 as well. The vessel will definitely stay there for many years producing oil, so we just have to wait and see," Saetre explained. Shares in BW Offshore traded 1.2 percent higher at 7.44 Norwegian crowns at 11.36 GMT compared to a 0.4 percent rise in the Oslo benchmark index <.OSEBX>.
