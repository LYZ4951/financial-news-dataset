March 25 (Reuters) - Investment bank Panmure Gordon & Co Plc's <PMR.L> full-year profit nearly doubled, as it signed new clients and got a boost from the pick-up in British IPO activity in the second half.

The 138-year-old stockbroker said net commission and fee income - an important metric for investment banks - rose 29 percent to 27.32 million pounds ($45.05 million) in the year ended Dec. 31. [ID:nBw5cWz3Ya]
