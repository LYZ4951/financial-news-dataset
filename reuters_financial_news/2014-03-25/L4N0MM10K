HANOI, March 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> rose 0.26 percent at the break on Tuesday with mixed movements for blue chips and liquidity boosted by buying in small cap firms.

Dairy product maker Vinamilk <VNM.HM> led the gains, with shares advancing 0.7 percent. Food producer Masan Group <MSN.HM> increased 1 percent. Trade volume hit 134 million shares at midday, compared to the five-day average level of 189 million, driven by speculation in some penny stocks, according to Doan Thi Anh Nguyet, an analyst at Saigon-Hanoi Securities. Property firm Tan Tao Investment and Industry Corp <ITA.HM> was the most traded stock at 11.8 million shares, jumping 5 percent. The index is likely to face some corrections soon as investors have started to take profit from some small-cap stocks, Nguyet added. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at midday (0431 GMT).
