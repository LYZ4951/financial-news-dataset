RIO DE JANEIRO, March 25 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks and currencies gained along with other Latin American markets on Tuesday as investors shrugged off a downgrade of Brazil's credit rating and focused instead on encouraging U.S. consumer confidence data.

The Brazilian real <BRL=> rose 0.5 percent after falling slightly in the beginning of the session in a knee-jerk reaction to Standard & Poor's decision late on Monday to cut Brazil's credit rating to BBB-minus, its lowest investment grade level. Even as the timing of the downgrade took some Brazilian policymakers by surprise, financial markets were unfazed by a move they had broadly priced in. [ID:nL4N0ML4HZ] "It is like a student who knows he didn't do well in the exams," said Tarcisio Rodrigues, a director at Banco Paulista in Sao Paulo. "The downgrade only confirmed what was expected." Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index <.BVSP> initially rose 0.9 percent as investors focused on data showing U.S. consumer confidence rose in March to its highest level in more than six years. [ID:nZON054S00] Market enthusiasm abated later, however, as key Wall Street indexes also erased most of their gains. As the S&P 500 index <.SPX> traded nearly flat, the Bovespa was only marginally higher while Mexico's IPC index <.MXX> dipped into negative territory. Shares of Brazil's JBS SA <JBSS3.SA>, the world's largest meat producer by sales, slumped more than 5 percent after it missed analysts expectations for its fourth-quarter profit due surging operating costs. [ID:nL1N0ML1OZ] On the other hand, shares of Brazil's Vale SA <VALE5.SA> rose more than 1 percent as analysts bet the world's largest iron ore producer could benefit from exports to China if expectations that Beijing will act to support the country's economic growth prove correct. [ID:nL4N0ML2US]Most Latin American markets had gained on Monday on speculation that China would unveil fresh stimulus measures to counter a weaker-than-expected performance of its manufacturing sector in the first quarter of the year.
