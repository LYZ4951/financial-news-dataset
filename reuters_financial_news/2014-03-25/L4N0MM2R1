COLOMBO, March 25 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks hit their two-weeks high Tuesday led by large-cap shares, but trading volumes continued to be low ahead of an impending U.N. resolution on the country's human rights record.

The main stock index <.CSE> closed up 0.52 percent, or 30.55 points, at 5,952.78 - its highest since March 10. Tuesday's turnover was 416.4 million rupees ($3.19 million), less than half of this year's daily average of 861.1 million rupees. "Most investors are waiting to assess the impact of the resolution," a stockbroker said on condition of anonymity. Sri Lanka's 2.47 trillion rupee bourse saw a net foreign outflow of 32.4 million rupees worth shares, extending the net selling so far this year to 4.13 billion rupees.  It had recorded a 22.88 billion rupee inflow in 2013. Ceylon Tobacco Co Plc's <CTC.CM> stock jumped 6.4 percent to 1,097.90 rupees, with only 673 shares traded. The prospect of a resolution that could hurt the country's economy has dented investor sentiment, analysts said. Several potential buyers of risky assets are awaiting a clear direction.
