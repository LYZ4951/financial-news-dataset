WASHINGTON, March 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Internal Revenue Service said on Tuesday that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are to be treated as property for tax purposes.

Weighing in with official guidance in a murky tax area, the IRS said wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, while other payments made using virtual currency are also taxable.
