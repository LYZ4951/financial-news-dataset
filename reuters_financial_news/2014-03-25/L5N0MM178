LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - Swiss private equity firm Partners Group <PGHN.S> proposed a record dividend payout after posting a 6.4 percent rise in full-year profit on Tuesday.

The investment manager said that 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) hit 300 million Swiss francs ($339.3 million) thanks to strong client demand and higher earnings from management fees.  The company plans to raise its dividend to a record 7.25 Swiss francs per share, up 16 percent on the payout for 2012.
