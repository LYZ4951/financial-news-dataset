MADRID, March 25 (Reuters) - Spain has proposed creditor banks take a 50 percent haircut on debt owed by nine failed motorways and will pay the balance via a 30-year bond of around 2.3 billion euros ($3.17 billion) with a coupon of at least 1 percent, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
