MUMBAI, Mar 25 (Reuters) - India's NSE index gained only 0.1 percent on Tuesday, but it was enough to hit a record high as blue chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> extended recent gains bolstered by buying from foreign institutional investors.

The gains offset steep falls in Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) <ONGC.NS> following an unexpected request by India's Election Commission late on Monday for the government to defer a rise in gas prices. [ID:nL4N0ML3RT] The NSE index <.NSEI> rose as much as 0.1 percent to an all time high of 6,592.15 points, surpassing its previous all-time high hit just on Monday by less than one point. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> was up 0.04 percent, just a few points shy of making a new record high. ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> gained 1.2 percent, while ITC <ITC.NS> rose 0.9 percent.
