March 25 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Swiss Credit Card  Issuance's notes, as follows: EUR351.1m No.1 Ltd. - Class A notes: affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Stable Outlook EUR11.5m No.1 Ltd. - Class B notes: affirmed at 'Asf'; Stable Outlook EUR7.4m No.1 Ltd. - Class C notes: affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Stable Outlook EUR189.8m No.2 Ltd. - Class A notes: affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Stable Outlook EUR6.2m No.2 Ltd. - Class B notes: affirmed at 'Asf'; Stable Outlook EUR4m No.2 Ltd. - Class C notes: affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Stable Outlook Swiss Credit Card Issuance is a programme created in June 2012 to issue note  series collateralised by Swiss consumer credit card receivables originated by  Credit Suisse AG (CS, A/Stable/F1). Both series were issued within the  programme's linked note issuance structure.KEY RATING DRIVERS Since its creation the programme has shown stable performance that is in line  with or better than Fitch's expectations. Sixty-180 days delinquency rates were  0.9% as of end-February 2014, significantly lower than in comparable  transactions in the UK.  A favourable economic environment has supported programme performance, leading  to fairly low charge-off rates since closing, with a current figure of 1.45%,  based on the latest investor report. Average monthly payment rates (MPR) in the  programme since closing have been above 65%, in line with historically high  rates in the originator's books as most customers pay off the credit card  balance every month. Portfolio gross yields have been above Fitch's expectations  as well.  Fitch's outlook for the Swiss economy is stable, with accelerated growth  throughout 2014. Unemployment is expected to remain around 3% which is the  lowest among European peer countries. The economic environment is expected to be  supportive for the programme in that no performance deterioration is expected.  This is reflected in the Stable Outlook for the notes.  As CS is one of the largest commercial banks in Switzerland, numerous credit  card customers hold deposits with the bank. This gives rise to potential deposit  set-off claims by customers in case of an insolvency of CS. Furthermore, the  high MPR exposes the series to elevated commingling risk. Nevertheless, these  risks are, in Fitch's view, sufficiently mitigated by structural features and a  comparably high variable seller share. The series have benefited from significant excess spread since closing,  providing the notes with a first layer of protection against charge-offs.  Further, the class A notes benefit from overcollateralisation created by the  subordination of class B and C notes, overall providing them with 5.1% credit  enhancement. If excess spread decreases below certain threshold levels, excess  spread will be trapped in a spread account to provide credit enhancement for the  class C notes. The notes pay a fixed-rate coupon on annual basis. Scheduled maturity for Swiss  Credit Card Issuance No.1 Ltd is in June 2015, while Swiss Credit Card Issuance  No.2 Ltd's scheduled maturity is in June 2016. Neither one of the transactions  has started accumulating repaid principal; the length of the accumulation period  for both series is dependent on the MPR.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch has maintained its base case assumptions set at the respective  transactions' closing dates.  The notes' ratings are most sensitive to changes in the MPR as well as the  charge-off rate.
