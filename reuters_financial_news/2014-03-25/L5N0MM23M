LONDON, March 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a day's low on Tuesday after European Central Bank governing council member and Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said negative interest rates would be more appropriate to use to counter a higher exchange rate.

Weidmann also added that it was not 'out of the question' for the ECB to buy bank assets to fight deflation, in a softening of the German central bank's strict stance on the issue. [ID:nF9N0D3011]
