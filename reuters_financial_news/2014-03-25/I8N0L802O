MUMBAI, March 25 (Reuters) - Indian shares ended flat on Tuesday after hitting record highs as blue chips such as ICICI Bank extended recent gains, bolstered by buying from foreign institutional investors.

The NSE index <.NSEI> provisionally ended 0.1 percent higher after marking its all-time high of 6,595.55, while the benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> ended 0.06 percent lower after marking a record high of 22,079.96, surpassing their previous all-time highs hit on Monday. However, sharp falls in Reliance Industries Ltd <RELI.NS> and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) <ONGC.NS> following an unexpected request by the Election Commission late on Monday for the government to defer a rise in gas prices, prevented any meaningful upside.
