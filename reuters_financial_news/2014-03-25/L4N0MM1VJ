HANOI, March 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN index <.VNI> closed down 0.94 percent at 601.85 points on Tuesday, ending a two-day gaining streak, fueled by profit-taking and net selling among foreign investors.

Real estate firm Vingroup <VIC.HM> led the losses, closing down 1.92 percent, while Hanoi-based bank BIDV <BID.HM> lost 2.27 percent. "The market has increased a lot, so there has to be a correction," said analyst Nguyen Hoang Phuong at Ho Chi Minh City Securities, adding that the number of investors taking profit was high. Foreigners have sold 6.42 trillion dong ($304.5 million) worth of shares in March, well above their purchase of 5.3 trillion dong, exchange data showed. They had been net buyers for the previous six straight months. Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT).  VN Index   601.85  PREV.
