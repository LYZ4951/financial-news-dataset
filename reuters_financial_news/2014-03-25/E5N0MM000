RIO DE JANEIRO, March 25 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank on Tuesday said it will continue to respond to challenges in the international scenario after Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the country's credit ratings.

That response includes a rigorous set of macroeconomic policies, a flexible exchange rate regime and the use of liquidity buffers "to smooth out moves in asset prices," the central bank said in a statement.
