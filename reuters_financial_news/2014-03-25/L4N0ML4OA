SYDNEY, March 25 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 0.6 percent on Tuesday morning after Wall Street declined on escalating tensions in Ukraine and as gold and oil stocks slumped on the back of a sharp drop in commodity prices.

Gold miners took a heavy beating as bullion prices tumbled about 2 percent as hedge funds sold the precious metal on bets that rising U.S. interest rates could spark a further retreat from last week's six-month high. [IDP:nL4N0MM00D] Australia's top gold producer Newcrest Mining Ltd <NCM.AX> lost 4.4 percent, while OceanaGold Corp <OGC.AX> dived 9.2 percent.  The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> shed 32.7 points to 5,314.2 by 0101 GMT. The benchmark added 0.2 percent on Monday on bargain hunting.  The benchmark touched a 5-1/2 year high of 5,462.3 on March 7 but has since drifted lower as the crisis in Ukraine and concerns over slowing growth in China, Australia's largest export market, soured investor sentiment. [ID:nL5N0ML33E] [ID:nL4N0ML0CG] "I think the main concern is China at the moment, the Chinese economy has given us a clear sign that it's slowing down, that's why the demand has been volatile," said Biyi Cheng, head of dealing for the Asia Pacific at City Index. Monday's flash Markit/HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index showed activity in China's factories contracted again in March, falling to an eight-month low of 48.1 from February's reading of 48.5. [ID:nB9N0F301J] Brent crude oil fell on the lacklustre manufacturing report from China, the world's largest oil consumer. Australia's top oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPL.AX> fell 0.7 percent while Santos Ltd <STO.AX> shed 1 percent.   The 'Big Four' banks were also down with National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> off 0.5 percent and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group <ANZ.AX> 0.2 percent lower.  "All the 'Big Four' banks are at high levels," Cheng said, indicating the pull back was largely technically-driven.  "Recently we've had a group of clients building up short-selling positions on banking stocks." TPG Telecom Group <TPM.AX> climbed 8 percent after touching all-time highs of A$6.35. The telecommunications and IT company reported healthy first half earnings and upgraded its guidance for the year. [ID:nS9N0KH01B] iiNet <IIN.AX> added 4.5 percent after analysts said TPG could make a move to buy the rival internet service provider. Yancoal Australia Ltd <YAL.AX> tumbled 6 percent to all-time lows of A$0.545 as China's Yanzhou Coal Mining Co Ltd <600188.SS> ditched a plan to buy out the minority shareholders of its Australian arm. [ID:nL4N0ML0SZ] New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> slipped 0.1 percent to 5,112.8.
