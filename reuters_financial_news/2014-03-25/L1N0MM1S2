BOSTON, March 25 (Reuters) - Daniel Loeb's Third Point on Tuesday sued Sotheby's <BID.N> to remove restrictions that blocked the hedge fund from acquiring  up to 20 percent of the auction house's stock.

"The Board rejected Third Point's request out-of-hand and continues to enforce the Poison Pill against Third Point," the hedge fund said in the suit which was filed in Delaware Chancery Court.
