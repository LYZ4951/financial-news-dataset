MILAN, March 25 (Reuters) - International rating agency Standard & Poor's has removed Generali <GASI.MI> from its Credit Watch list after ascertaining that Italy's biggest insurer would not exhaust its regulatory capital even if its home country were to default on its debt.

In a statement, the rating agency said it affirmed Generali's rating at A-, two notches above Italy's sovereign rating, with a negative outlook.
