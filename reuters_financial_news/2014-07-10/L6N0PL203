FRANKFURT, July 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank reiterated in its monthly bulletin on Thursday its readiness to use unconventional policy instruments should it become necessary to further address risks of inflation staying low for too long.

As usual, the editorial of the bank's bulletin was virtually identical to its main policy statement, read out by ECB President Mario Draghi last Thursday. The ECB said in the editorial that "the key ECB interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the current outlook for inflation." "Moreover, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation." Below is a list of articles and special sections the bulletin contains. The articles can often shed light on the ECB's thinking about key issues and give an insight into the type of analysis the bank uses to support its policy decisions.  * Understanding global trade elasticities: what has changed? * Commodity price developments and their implications for global inflation * Real interest rates in the euro area: a longer-term perspective * Inflation risk premia in market-based measures of inflation expectations * Recent developments in inflation forecasts and shorter and longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area * Predicting the strength of recoveries * The macroeconomic effects of structural reforms * Euro area risk-free interest rates: measurement issues, recent developments and relevance to monetary policy * SME access to finance in the euro area: barriers and potential policy remedies * The Phillips curve relationship in the euro area
