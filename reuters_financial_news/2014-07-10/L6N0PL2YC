LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday as southern European indexes tumbled on weak data from Italy and growing concerns over the financial health of Portugal's largest listed bank.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares hit a two-month low, dropping 1.2 percent to 1,346,72 points as of 1104 GMT, taking its losses since early this month to about 4 percent.  Portugal's PSI share index <.PSI20> fell 4.4 percent, lagging all other European benchmarks after shares and bonds of Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESF.LS>, the chief shareholder in Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS>, were suspended over "material difficulties" at its parent firm ESI. Banco Espirito Santo shares dived 15.8 percent. [ID:nL6N0PL241] Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> fell 2.5 percent after data showed Italian industrial output posted its steepest monthly fall since November 2012 in May, casting doubts over the country's economic recovery. [ID:nR1N0PC02U] "The BES situation is a tangled story of cross holdings and unexplained debts which has highlighted the risks that still exist in some European banks," said Lorne Baring, managing director of B Capital Wealth Management. "There is some contagion effect in markets today. However, it may be an over-reaction to the BES news, which comes as Italian data showed a drop in production whereas the market expected a gain. Some investors may be questioning the strength of the peripheral Europe recovery after a strong market performance." The market also came under pressure due to weaker Nordic stocks after disappointing updates from Norwegian bank DNB <DNB.OL> and Swedish construction firm Skanska <SKAb.ST>. Norway's largest bank posted lower-than-expected second-quarter results, partly due to higher loan losses, while Skanska said it would significantly scale down its loss-making Latin American operations after taking a charge in the second quarter. Their shares, down 4.4 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. [ID:nL6N0PL160] [ID:nL6N0PL160] All European equity sectors fell on Thursday. Banks led the decline, with the STOXX Europe 600 Banking Index <.SX7P> dropping 2.7 percent to a seven-month low. Erste group <ERST.VI> fell 5.1 percent, while Banco Popular <POP.MC> fell 5 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 hit a 6-1/2 year high last month but is now down for the fourth out of five sessions as a handful of disappointing earnings updates cast a shadow over the upcoming reporting season and raised questions about a nearly 10 percent rally between mid-March and last week. "We were looking at an overextended market, so a degree of profit taking was inevitable," IG chief market strategist Brenda Kelly said. On the positive side, luxury group Burberry <BRBY.L> rose 1.8 percent, the leading FTSEurofirst 300 gainer, after posting a 12 percent rise in like-for-like retail sales for its fiscal first quarter to June 30.  However, it warned that if exchange rates remained at today's levels, that would have a "material impact on profits". "Despite driving best-in-class top-line growth, the continued margin pressure at Burberry remains a concern, and today's results do not help to improve the profitability gap that exists between Burberry and its luxury peers," Bernstein analysts said in a note.
