MUMBAI, July 10 (Reuters) - India's NSE index <.NSEI> turned positive as shares of financial firms such as IDFC <IDFC.NS> and ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> jumped after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley raised the foreign direct investment limit in the insurance sector, offsetting earlier profit-taking.

The 50-share NSE index <.NSEI> was up 0.9 percent after earlier falling as much as 1.4 percent to its lowest in nearly 2-1/2 weeks. The NSE sub-index for banks <.NSEBANK> is up 0.6 percent after earlier falling as much as 1.7 percent.
