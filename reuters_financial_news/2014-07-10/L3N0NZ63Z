SYDNEY, July 11(Reuters) - Australian shares are set to open lower on Friday after Wall street ended down on concerns about the health of one of Portugal's top listed banks, but mining stocks may lend support after gold surged to a 3-12 month high on safe-haven buying and oil ended its longest losing streak in years.
