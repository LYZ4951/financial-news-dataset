NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - The amount of U.S. commercial paper contracted in the week ended July 9 Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday.

U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $12.1 billion to $1.042 trillion in the latest week. Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - rose $6.9 billion to $1.056 trillion.
