LISBON, July 10 (Reuters) - Espirito Santo Financial Group, the largest shareholder in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS>, said on Thursday it had decided to suspend its shares and bonds citing "material difficulties" at its parent company ESI.

"Due to ongoing material difficulties at its largest shareholder Espirito Santo International S.A. (ESI) and ESFG's exposure to that company, ESFG has decided to suspend its shares and listed bonds, including the bond issued by its fully owned subsidiary Espirito Santo Financiere," it said in a filing with the securities market regulator in Portugal.
