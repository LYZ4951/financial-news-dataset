LISBON, July 10 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Espirito Santo (BES), Portugal's largest listed bank by assets, plunged more than 15 percent on Thursday to hit one-year lows on growing concerns that financial troubles at holding companies of the bank's founding family will have an impact on BES.

At 0950 GMT its shares were 15.77 percent lower at 0.5180 euros a share. The slide accelerated on Thursday after Espirito Santo Financial Group (ESFG) <ESF.LS>, which holds the family's 25 percent stake in BES, said it had decided to suspend trade in its shares and bonds, citing problems at one of the holding companies.[ID:nL6N0PL27C] Joao Lampreia, an analyst at Banco Big, said BES was falling because the probability of a restructuring of debt at family holding companies was growing. "We are talking about a direct and indirect exposure (by BES to family holding companies) of 3.5 billion euros, in other words BES' market cap," said Lampreia.
