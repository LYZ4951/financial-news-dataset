DUBAI, July 10 (Reuters) - Stock markets in the region look likely to consolidate on Thursday as the Ramadan lull dominates most bourses, bringing lower volumes and thin news flow.

Market activity in the United Arab Emirates, in particular, slowed down significantly in the last session. Dubai's bourse <.DFMGI> was flat as trading volume dropped 45 percent. Abu Dhabi <.ADI> slipped 0.2 percent as volume fell by a third. Analysts have said the two markets are unlikely to move much until local companies publish their second-quarter results, expected in late July and early August. Qatar's trading volume fell 15 percent on Wednesday as the Doha index <.QSI> advanced 1.3 percent. Market players are betting on positive second-quarter results, which Qatari companies publish slightly ahead of their UAE peers. Saudi Arabia <.TASI> has been range-bound this week as volumes declined for four sessions in a row. Saudi British Bank <1060.SE> (SABB) may see some gains after its second-quarter profit came in marginally ahead of analysts' estimates on Wednesday. The bank said it earned 1.16 billion riyals ($309 million) in the three months to June 30, compared with 1.00 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected the bank to post an average net profit of 1.09 billion riyals for the quarter. [ID:nL6N0PK3U9]
