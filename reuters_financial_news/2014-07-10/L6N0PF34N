PARIS, July 10 (Reuters) - France has received EU backing for a new decree allowing the government to block foreign takeovers of French companies in strategic industries, Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said on Thursday.

In a surprise move, the government widened in May its control over mergers in industries deemed key to France's national interests as General Electric <GE.N> was seeking to buy the energy assets of French group Alstom <ALSO.PA>.
