July 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has placed COREALCREDIT BANK  AG's [RWBG.UL] (COREALCREDIT; BBB/F2/Stable) mortgage Pfandbriefe 'AA-' rating on Rating  Watch Positive (RWP).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The RWP follows COREALCREDIT's announcement that it will withdraw its public  overcollateralisation (OC) commitment, effective 08 August 2014. COREALCREDIT  has stated that the withdrawal is linked to the upgrade of the bank's Short-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'F2'(see "Fitch Upgrades COREALCREDIT's IDR to  'BBB' on Acquisition By Aareal Bank" dated 9 April 2014 on  www.fitchratings.com), which was the result of COREALCREDIT's acquisition by  Aareal Bank Group.  In the absence of a public OC commitment, Fitch will base its analysis on the  lowest observed OC within the past 12 months, currently 14.9%, providing upgrade  potential to the mortgage covered bonds' current 'AA-' rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The Pfandbriefe could be upgraded if the cover pool balance provides for  sufficient relied upon OC in excess of the agency's breakeven OC of 14%  estimated for the 'AA' stress.
