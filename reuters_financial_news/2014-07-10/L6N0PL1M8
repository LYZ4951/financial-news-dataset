COPENHAGEN, July 10 (Reuters) - Tryg <TRYG.CO>, the Nordic region's second-biggest general insurer, posted second-quarter earnings above expectations and maintained its financial targets on Thursday.

Chief executive Morten Hubbe made the following comments in a telephone interview with Reuters:  "Our financial targets are very ambitious. I understand when analysts asks whether it is possible to reach them. I expect we will reach them and the second quarter confirms that we are on the right track."  "If we each quarter had as much momentum as we have had in the second quarter, we should probably re-think our financial goals. But it is clear that it has been an unusual quarter."  "Our top line is falling less in the second quarter than last year. We see prices on several products fall. Prices used to rise as much as inflation but we have seen prices on car insurance drop half a percent."  "Our customer loyalty and sales have increased among both private and corporate customers."
