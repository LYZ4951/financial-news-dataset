July 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says in a new report that a new  generation of fixed income funds demands greater skills from portfolio managers  to perform in a low but increasing yield and spread environment.  A growing, more sophisticated segment of the fund market consists of global  benchmark unconstrained or absolute return  fixed income funds, as investors  move away from core fixed income benchmarked strategies. The new generation of  fixed income funds implements more active, less correlated strategies to exploit  market opportunities on both long and short trades, while attempting to protect  capital from rising rates, spread widening or credit losses.  In Fitch's view, these strategies can be broadly segregated into flexible  beta-driven and pure alpha-driven strategies. A fund's risk/returns in various  markets will be influenced, in part, by where the fund fits into this bifurcated  framework. "Managing a new generation fixed income fund is more skills-based and more  technical compared with traditional fixed income funds. The ability to  effectively implement derivatives- based overlay or hedging strategies, as well  as high-conviction directional or relative value trades will be the basis for  performance differentiation between managers," says Manuel Arrive, Senior  Director in Fitch's Fund and Asset Manager Rating group. The flexibility given in tactical allocation or long/short trading, away from  the constraints of traditional benchmarks to a broader investment universe,  increases the fund's reliance on the portfolio manager. For instance, fixed  income funds increasingly use derivatives strategies and hedging mechanisms,  which require specialised expertise borrowed from the hedge fund world. In  addition, the search for yield tends to lead managers to favour higher-risk,  less liquid assets through barbell strategies, which demand advanced credit  selection skills.  "There is a lot of focus on duration risk at the moment but our view is that  credit, counterparty, liquidity and manager risk is also increasing within fixed  income portfolios," adds Mr Arrive.  Fitch's fixed income unconstrained peer group and absolute return peer group  show close to no correlation to interest rates and credit. While absolute return  funds performed better than unconstrained funds during the June 2013 sell-off,  over a three-year period, unconstrained funds performed better than absolute  return funds, which had their track record tarnished in 2011.  The short track record and wide variance in funds' risk/return profiles presents  a particular challenge in performance analysis and peer-group construction.
