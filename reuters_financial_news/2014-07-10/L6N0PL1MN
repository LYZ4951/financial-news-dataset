LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - European shares edged lower on Thursday, led by Nordic shares after disappointing updates by Norwegian bank DNB and Swedish construction firm Skanska.

Norway's largest bank posted lower than expected second-quarter results, partly due to higher loan losses, while Skanska said its Latin American operations showed continued losses. [ID:nL6N0PL160] [ID:nL6N0PL160] They were among top fallers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which was down 0.1 percent at 1,362.27 points at 0715 GMT.
