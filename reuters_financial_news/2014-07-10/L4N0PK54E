SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - Australian shares were flat on Thursday, with an overnight rise on Wall Street and higher metal prices providing support but mixed local jobs data and mildly disappointing Chinese trade figures preventing any move higher.

The S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> had slipped 0.3 point to 5,452.2 by 0205 GMT with 98 shares higher, 87 falling and 14 unchanged. Australian employment rose a solid 15,900 in June to just beat forecasts but that did not prevent the unemployment rate from hitting a four-month high of 6 percent as more people went looking for work. [ID:nL4N0PJ15G] China's imports remained weak in June, highlighting sluggish domestic demand, although recent data has pointed to signs of stabilisation. [ID:nB9N0P6026] China is Australia's largest export market.  "There's probably a bit of disappointment this morning in terms of market performance. We were looking to recoup some of yesterday's losses but that just hasn't materialised at this stage," said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress.In the resources sector, big-name miners BHP Billiton Ltd <BHP.AX> and Rio Tinto Ltd <RIO.AX> added 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.

REITs were also propped up on the back of Westfield shopping centre's Scentre Group <SCG.AX> raising more than A$3 billion in a European debt deal. Scentre climbed 2.2 percent to an all-time high of A$3.28, while Westfield Corp <WFD.AX> added 1.1 percent. A handful of top stocks trailed lower with consumer retail staple Woolworths Ltd <WOW.AX> down 0.2 percent and top lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX> slipping 0.3 percent.  Trading in Syrah Resources Ltd <SYR.AX> was halted after the  shares shot more than 20 percent higher on speculation it was a takeover target. [ID:nS9N0OD02A] Gas pipe owner Envestra <EVN.AX> soared 5.7 percent to a one-month high of A$0.83 after it said it was reconsidering its support for CKI's <1038.HK> $2.2 billion bid for it.
