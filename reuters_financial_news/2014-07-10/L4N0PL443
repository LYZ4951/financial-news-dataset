July 10 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> has asked regulators to approve a higher quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share after it withdrew a previously planned increase in April, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The bank withdrew its previously planned increase to 5 cents from 1 cent per share, after it found errors that reduced a key capital level by $4 billion. [ID:nL3N0NK4HT] The second-largest U.S. bank said it had resubmitted its new capital plan in May but did not provide details. In the latest proposal, the bank is seeking approval for a smaller share buyback than proposed in April, the Journal reported without providing a figure.
