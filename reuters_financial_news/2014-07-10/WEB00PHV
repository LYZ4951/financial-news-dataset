VIENNA, July 10 (Reuters) - Austria's Erste Group Bank <ERST.VI> faces a hit of up to 300 million euros ($409 million) from a new Hungarian law that makes banks compensate borrowers for mispriced foreign-currency loans, a spokesman said on Thursday.

Erste had cited the impact of the law and fresh writedowns in Romania when warning last week that it expected a record 2014 loss of up to 1.6 billion euros. [ID:nL6N0PF1E9]
