BUDAPEST, July 10 (Reuters) - Hungary's new bill on bank loans is credit negative for its banks who will have to pay up to 2.6 billion euros in compensation to borrowers, rating agency Moody's said on Thursday.

The payments could reduce the average capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector to 12.5 percent from 17.4 percent at the end of last year, said Simone Zampa, the agency's Vice President for banking, in a note.
