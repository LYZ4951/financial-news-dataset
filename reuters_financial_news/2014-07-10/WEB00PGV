VIENNA, July 10 (Reuters) - Raiffeisen Bank International <RBIV.VI> said it would take a charge of 120 to 160 million euros ($164 to $218 million) as a result of new legislation in Hungary requiring banks to compensate customers who took out foreign-exchange loans.

"RBI estimates that this development could result in a one off charge, including penalties, of between EUR 120 mn and EUR 160 mn, expected to be spread across Q2 and Q3 2014," the bank said in a statement late on Wednesday.
