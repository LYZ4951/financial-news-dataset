HONG KONG, July 10 (Reuters) - China shares were limp on Thursday after June export data came in weaker than expected, but the power sector outperformed after a report said a draft plan for reforming the country's power had been drawn up.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> closed flat at 2,038.34 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings inched down 0.3 percent. Huadian Power <600027.SS> climbed 4 percent, while Huaneng Power <600011.SS> 0.7 percent. Some smaller names in the sector jumped the maximum allowed 10 percent. Shanghai Securities News reported on Thursday a draft on electric power system reforms had been completed, which would encourage more private capital in power distribution.  Bank of China <601988.SS> was the biggest index drag in Shanghai, sinking 0.8 percent.
