MUMBAI, July 10 (Reuters) - India's broader NSE index fell more than 1 percent on Thursday to its lowest in nearly 2-1/2 weeks as lenders such as ICICI Bank were hit by profit-taking even as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stuck to the previous government's fiscal deficit target.

Jaitley stuck to the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of gross domestic product for the year ending March 2015 set by the previous government. [ID:nL4N0PL1MD] The NSE sub-index for banks <.NSEBANK> fell 1.7 percent. ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> lost 1.9 percent while HDFC Bank Ltd <HDBK.NS> was down 1.5 percent.
