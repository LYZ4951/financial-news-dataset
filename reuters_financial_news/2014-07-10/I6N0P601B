MILAN, July 10 (Reuters) - Italian energy group Enel <ENEI.MI> said on Thursday its board agreed on a plan to sell its power generation assets in Slovakia and its distribution and sales assets in Romania.

The sale of the holdings in Slovakia and Romania are part of a broader 6 billion euro programme of asset sales begun in 2013 and aimed at reducing Enel's debt.  The Slovakian and Romanian assets, together with other non-strategic assets, will contribute more than 4.4 billion euros ($6 billion), the company said in a statement.
