LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - European shares eased on Thursday, led down by Nordic stocks after disappointing updates from Norwegian bank DNB <DNB.OL> and Swedish construction firm Skanska <SKAb.ST>.

Norway's largest bank posted lower-than-expected second-quarter results, partly due to higher loan losses, while Skanska said it would significantly scale down its loss-making Latin American operations after taking a charge in the second quarter. [ID:nL6N0PL160] [ID:nL6N0PL160] Their shares, each down about 3 percent, were the top fallers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which was down 0.1 percent at 1,362.54 points by 0743 GMT. The index, which hit a 6-1/2 year highs last month, was down for the fourth out of the past five sessions as a handful of disappointing earnings updates cast a shadow on the upcoming reporting season and raised questions about a nearly 10-percent rally between mid-March and last week. "We were looking at an overextended market, so a degree of profit taking was inevitable," IG chief market strategist Brenda Kelly said. The euro zone blue chip Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> was down 0.3 percent while Olso's OSEBX <.OSEBX> shed 1 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> was up 0.1 percent, helped by a rise in luxury group Burberry <BRBY.L>. Burberry shares were up 2.3 percent, to be the leading FTSEurofirst 300 gainers, posted a 12 percent rise in like-for-like retail sales for its fiscal first quarter to June 30. It warned, however, that if exchange rates remained at today's levels, that would have a "material impact on profits". "Despite driving best-in-class top-line growth, the continued margin pressure at Burberry remains a concern, and today's results do not help to improve the profitability gap that exists between Burberry and its luxury peers," Bernstein analysts wrote in a note.  "Given the recent underperformance of the stock, we expect today's results to be positively received by the market."
