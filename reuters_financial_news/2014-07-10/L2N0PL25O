SAO PAULO, July 10 (Reuters) - MRV Engenharia <MRVE3.SA>, Brazil's largest low-income homebuilder, is unfazed by a potential economic slowdown and optimistic that coming changes to a government-subsidized housing program will help support growth, co-Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Fischer told Reuters on Thursday.

Belo Horizonte-based MRV focuses on projects within the federal Minha Casa Minha Vida, or My House My Life, program, which provides cheap loans and housing subsidies for Brazilians in the three lowest income brackets.  Earlier this month, Brazil's government approved an additional 3 million homes in the program. While MRV does not serve the lowest income level, Fischer was confident when asked if a new bracket will be introduced just above it, providing an additional client base for its products. "We are betting on a yes," Fischer said, adding that he expects the maximum price of homes eligible for the program to rise when new rules are released later this month. While Brazil's economy is expected to slow to just 1 percent growth this year from 2.5 percent in 2013, the rosy outlook for Minha Casa Minha Vida and persistently strong demand outweighs concerns over a near-term economic slowdown, Fischer said. "We aren't slowing down (launches) - to the contrary," he said, adding that the company had a good quarter for sales in the April to June period. MRV is expected to release second-quarter earnings on Aug. 14. "The housing deficit in Brazil is still a big problem," Fischer said. "We have a market with strong demand, and that will be served by Minha Casa Minha Vida because the bottom of the pyramid is mainly where the deficit is. We are practically on our own in some markets, and that gives us a big competitive advantage." Sales cancellations have been a thorn in the side of Brazil's homebuilders in recent quarters, and MRV saw cancellations at around 21 percent of gross sales in the first quarter. Fischer said that level should fall a lot next year as the company implements a new program registering pre-sales only after the client's mortgage has been approved by a bank.  Fischer also said the company's debt ratio should remain at current levels, currently around 30 percent of shareholder equity, while profit margins should improve in coming quarters.
