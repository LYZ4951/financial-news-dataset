ROME, July 10 (Reuters) - Italian state holding company Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) aims to raise around 4-5 billion euros from selling its stakes in various companies, its chief executive said on Thursday.

"It will definitely be a few billion, the market will decide whether four or five," Giovanni Gorno Tempini told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Rome, adding that would be an "appropriate value" for the assets.
