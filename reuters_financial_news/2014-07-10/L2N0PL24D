July 10 (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said on Thursday that it is time for investors to tread carefully after the run-up in U.S. stock markets.

"In my mind, it is time to be cautious about the U.S. stock markets," Icahn said in a telephone interview. "While we are having a great year, I am being very selective about the companies I purchase." Icahn also said Family Dollar Stores Inc <FDO.N> should think about a possible sale to Dollar General Corp <DG.N>. "The leadership, to say the least, is questionable at Family Dollar and it's been that way for many years," Icahn said. "Howard (Levine) might be a nice guy but he is far from the right leader for Family Dollar."
