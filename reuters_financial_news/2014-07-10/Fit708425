July 10 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Indonesia-based PT Multipolar Tbk's <MLPL.JK> (Multipolar) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating at 'B+' with Stable Outlook. The agency has also affirmed Multipolar's senior unsecured rating at 'B+' and USD230m notes due in 2018 at 'B+'/RR4. The notes are issued by Pacific Emerald Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary, and guaranteed  by Multipolar and certain subsidiaries.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Structural Subordination: Multipolar's rating reflects the subordination of its  cash flows due to its holding company structure. Most of its cash flows are from  dividends from 50.2%-owned PT Matahari Putra Prima <MPPA.JK> (MPPA, unrated) and  20.5%-owned PT Matahari Department Store Tbk <LPPF.JK> (MDS, unrated). Therefore,  Multipolar's capacity to meet its debt obligations is contingent upon MPPA's and  MDS's ability to continue to distribute dividends. We believe both MPPA and MDS  will continue to be able to pay Multipolar dividends over the medium term,  driven by both companies' favorable operating performance and strong financial  profile. MPPA, which operates Hypermart, is the fastest-growing hypermarket operator in  Indonesia with 99 stores as of end-2013. It has added new stores at double-digit  counts over the past three years. MDS has the biggest share of the market for  middle-class department stores based on annual turnover. MDS had 125 stores as  of end-2013.  Temporary Weakening in FCC: Fitch expects Multipolar's fixed charge cover (FCC-  FFO from wholly controlled entities plus dividends/ interest expense plus rents)  to fall below 2x in 2014 from 2.2x in 2013. This is due to a  slower-than-expected turnaround in its other businesses and a mismatch in the  currencies of its debt and cash flows. However Fitch expects the ratio to  improve in 2015 because 99%-owned retail subsidiary PT Nadya Putra Investama  (NPI) plans to distribute extraordinary dividends totaling around IDR500bn  (USD42m) for 2015-2017. As of end-2013, NPI reported cash balance of IDR568bn.  Fixed charge cover is also likely to rise beyond 2015 due to more stable  operations at its other businesses, which include integrated IT services,  bookstores, and game centers.  Comfortable Liquidity: As of end-March 2014, Multipolar (excluding MPPA) had  cash balance of around IDR2trn against IDR222bn in short-term debt. Multipolar  also has no significant debt maturing until 2018 when the USD230m notes fall  due. In a distressed scenario, Fitch believes Multipolar will be able to access  additional liquidity by monetising its various investments. For example,  Multipolar's various investment properties are worth about IDR2trn while its  shareholding at MPPA and MDS worth about USD1.4bn at 7 July 2014. High Fixed Cost Structure: Multipolar's strategy of renting all its property  increases its fixed costs, especially considering retailers' thin margin  buffers. Fitch believes Multipolar's growing scale and margin stability mitigate  its high fixed costs. MPPA has been negotiating with landlords of its  hypermarkets to switch from fixed-rate rents to rents that are tied to its  turnover. This strategy has helped to cut its consolidated rent to revenue ratio  to about 4% in 2013 from about 5% previously. In addition, Multipolar's  association with mall operator PT Lippo Karawaci Tbk <LPKR.JK> (Lippo; BB-/Stable), which  owns about 41% of Multipolar's retail space provides critical operating synergy  to both parties. Multipolar's retail outlets to drive foot traffic to Lippo's  malls, while Lippo is able to offer Multipolar priority in retail locations.  Conservative Strategy in China: Delays in new store openings and  underperformance of its existing stores have slowed down Multipolar's business  turnaround in China. However, the company's Robbinz department stores in China  have shown meaningful operating improvement. Although Fitch does not expect  significant improvement in the Chinese business over the medium term, the risk  associated with this business is mitigated because capital expenditure allocated  to it is limited and management has demonstrated a conservative approach in  making future investment decisions in China.  Contingent Liability to Temasek: Under the terms of an alliance agreement with  Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], if MPPA fails to meet Temasek's operating  performance targets, Multipolar will have to pay Temasek any shortfall of its  USD300m investment upon the latter's exit from MPPA. However, given the current  favorable retail market outlook, the risk of this liability crystallising is, in  Fitch's view, not high. As of 7 July 2014, Temasek's 26.1% indirect shareholding  at MPPA was worth about USD352m. Robust Private Consumption: The outlook for modern retail in Indonesia remains  robust, driven by the country's large population, consumers' increasing spending  power, young demographic, and high urbanisation rate. A 40% increase in the  minimum wage in the capital Jakarta in 2012 is starting to have an impact on  second-tier cities where MPAA and MDS are expanding.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Decline in FCC to below 2x on a sustained basis. This may result from  lower-than-expected dividends or significant deterioration in the performance of  non-core businesses.
