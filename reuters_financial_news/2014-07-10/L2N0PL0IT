NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were poised to drop more than 1 percent at the open on Thursday, weighed by a slump in European shares on concern over the health of Portugal's top listed bank and following weak data from Italy.

* With U.S. stocks trading near record highs, the selloff in Europe could entice shorts who have been mostly shut out of the market. Many market participants have called for a pullback, with the steady S&P 500 yet to see a daily decline of 1 percent or more since April 10. * Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESF.LS>, the largest shareholder in Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS>, suspended trading in its shares and bonds, citing "material difficulties" at parent company ESI. Shares of the bank fell 17.2 percent. [ID:nL6N0PL241] * Italian industrial output dropped 1.2 percent in May, its steepest monthly fall since November 2012, casting doubt over prospects for the country's economic recovery. [ID:nR1N0PC02U] * Portugal's benchmark stock index <.PSI20> fell 4.1 percent and Italy's FTSE MIB <.FTMIB> fell 2.3 percent. An index of European bank shares <.SX7P> was down 2.7 percent. U.S. banks will likely fall on concerns over exposure to Europe. * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> were down 22 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <1YMc1> fell 181 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> lost 48 points. * The CBOE Volatility Index is expected to snap higher after a period of hibernation. The VIX last week hit its lowest level since early 2007. The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term exchange-traded note <TVIX.O> rose 9.4 percent in heavy trading. * Futures held on to steep losses even after data showed filings for new U.S. unemployment benefits claims fell last week to one of the lowest levels since before the 2007-09 recession. [ID:nL2N0PK1JF] * Wholesale inventories and sales are due at 10:00 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). * Shares of Lumber Liquidators <LL.N> fell 21.8 percent in premarket trading a day after the hardwood flooring retailer cut its earnings outlook. Sandwich chain Potbelly <PBPB.O> estimated second-quarter revenue and profit below analysts expectations and its shares slid 18.7 percent in premarket trading.
