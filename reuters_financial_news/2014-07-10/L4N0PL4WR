July 10 (Reuters) - Consumer goods maker Unilever Plc <ULVR.L> <UNc.AS> said it had sold its Slim-Fast brand to Kainos Capital, a U.S.-based private equity firm focused on the food and consumer sector.

The sale is part of Unilever's ongoing effort to reshape its U.S. portfolio and focus on its core higher-margin personal care business, the company said. The Anglo-Dutch maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap and Lipton tea said it would retain a minority stake in the Slim-Fast business, which sells dietary food products, including snack bars and protein meal shakes. [ID:nBw5LHc3Na] Unilever did not disclose terms of the deal, which closed on Thursday. The company said in April that it would undertake a strategic review of its North American pasta sauce business, which includes the market-leading Ragu brand, and the troubled Slim-Fast brand whose sales have tumbled in its biggest market. [ID:nL6N0NG1JS] Unilever shares were down 1.5 percent at 2598 pence at 1657 GMT on the London Stock Exchange.
