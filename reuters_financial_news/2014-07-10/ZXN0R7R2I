NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as concerns about the financial health of Portugal's top listed bank gave investors a reason to cash in recent gains.

Despite that, equities ended well off their lows of the day. The S&P 500 fell as much as 1 percent at one point before sharply rebounding, though it closed under its 14-day moving average.
