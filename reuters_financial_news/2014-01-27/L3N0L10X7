HANOI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Eximbank <EIB.HM>, Vietnam's 10th biggest lender by assets, said on Monday it sees 2014 lending rising by 23 percent from last year to 109 trillion dong ($5.2 billion), above the targeted credit growth of the country's entire banking sector.

Eximbank, 15 percent owned by Japan's SMFG <8316.T>, aims to raise deposits by 21 percent to 100 trillion dong and keep bad debt at 3 percent of loans, the Management Board of the Ho Chi Minh City-based bank said in a statement dated Jan. 23. Vietnam's banking sector has planned to keep this year's annual credit growth at 12-14 percent to fuel quickening economic growth targeted at 5.8 percent. In 2013, loans rose 12.51 percent and the economy grew 5.42 percent. [ID:nL3N0KN0HB] Eximbank has not released 2013 earnings.  ($1=21,035 dong)
