FRANKFURT, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Commercial bank borrowing from the European Central Bank (ECB) has been high for years in the countries most affected by the sovereign debt crisis. Lending to banks in the euro zone core has, however, fallen.

Below is a breakdown of the loans in billions of euros. The amounts indicate the gross use of ECB lending facilities and the share in percent of overall outstanding liquidity at the time. ELA refers to Emergency Liquidity Assistance, funding that troubled banks can get separately from their national central bank. Not all central banks publish the ELA amounts. The GDP column is the share (in percent) of euro zone gross domestic product in 2012.
