MILAN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Banca Popolare di Milano (BPM) <PMII.MI> fell in early trade on Monday following news its top shareholder has sold the entire stake in the Italian cooperative lender, while rival Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> failed to start trading after a surprise announcement of a rights issue.

By 0808 GMT shares in Popolare Milano were down 3.8 percent, undperforming a 0.5 percent fall in Italy's blue-chip stock index <.FTMIB>. Banco Popolare said late on Friday it would carry out a 1.5 billion euro ($2.05 billion) capital increase in the first half after preliminary indications pointed to a larger-then-expected 600 million euro loss last year due to loan losses.
