BANGALORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank won't ease policy further even if money market rates start to rise above its refinancing rate, according to a majority of traders in a Reuters poll.

At the ECB's last meeting President Mario Draghi said an unwarranted rise in the interbank lending rates that underpin borrowing costs across the economy would be one possible trigger for more action. [ID:nL9N0IM03V] Short-term rates have recently risen above the ECB's refinancing rate after trading close to the deposit rate. But  Monday's poll showed 16 of 24 euro money market traders do not expect the central bank to ease policy further even if this remains the case. The refinancing rate is currently 0.25 percent and deposit rate zero. "For the ECB to act, the spikes in the money market rates need to be enormous and well beyond the recent highs," said one trader at a large dealer. Late last week EONIA <EONIA=> - Europe's interbank overnight rate - fell back below the ECB's main refinancing rate of 0.25 percent that banks pay when they borrow at the central bank's still-unrestricted lending operations. It stood at 0.191 percent on Friday, down from 0.210 percent in the previous session, after having fixed above the main refinancing rate for four sessions, the first time since 2011 that it has happened.

After having repaid almost half of those long-term loans, banks are expected to repay another 2.5 billion euros ($3.42 billion) next week, less than the 3.7 billion they will return this week. [ID:nZYN2D3400] The regular poll showed the ECB is expected to allot 115 billion euros at its weekly refinancing tender and 3 billion euros at its three-month tender.  Previously 116.28 billion euros was allotted at the weekly auction and 1.93 billion euros at the three-month tender in October.
