BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Germany's Constitutional Court is unlikely to rule before April on a complaint against the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme, credited with stabilising the euro zone during its debt crisis, a newspaper reported on Monday.

"The reason for the long period of consultations is apparently the highly controversial opinions among the eight," Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported, without citing sources, suggesting the judges are split.   The court is considering whether the ECB's plans to buy unlimited amounts of bonds from stricken euro zone states, announced in 2012 at the height of the bloc's crisis, is really a vehicle for funding member states through the back door.  That would violate German law.  The Karlsruhe-based court has never given a date for the ruling, eagerly awaited by financial markets, but it has said it is a "very complex" case. A ruling had initially been expected in the final quarter of last year.
