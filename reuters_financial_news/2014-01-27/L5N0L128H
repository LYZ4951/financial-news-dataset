BUDAPEST, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The board of directors at Hungary's loss-making MKB Bank [BLGGM.UL] has approved an 80.2 billion forint ($359 million) capital increase through the issuance of new shares in a private placement, MKB said on Monday.

The decision would increase MKB's registered capital to 225.5 billion forints, MKB said in a filing with the Budapest Stock Exchange. It said German owner BayernLB <BLGGgi.F> had already paid 79.1 billion forints for the shares on Friday.  BayernLB will pay the rest by Feb. 7 if minority shareholders do not exercise their pre-emption rights. Before the capital increase, BayernLB held a 98.6 percent stake in MKB, one of the biggest banks in Hungary.
