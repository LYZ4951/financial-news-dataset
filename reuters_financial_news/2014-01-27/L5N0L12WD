ISTANBUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank is expected to raise its overnight lending rate by 225 basis points to 10 percent at an emergency monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 31 economists.

Thirty of the economists polled on Monday forecast an interest rate hike, with estimates ranging from an increase of 125 basis points to 425 points. Only one forecast the bank would leave rates unchanged. Asked whether a rate hike would be enough to stabilise a tumbling lira and rising inflation, 12 of the economists said yes, while seven said no, citing the need for structural reforms and political stability.
