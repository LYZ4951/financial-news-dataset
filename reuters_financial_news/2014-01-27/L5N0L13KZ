STUTTGART, Germany, Jan 27 (Reuters) - European Central Bank governing council member Jens Weidmann said on Monday China's yuan <CNY=CFXS> did not qualify yet as a reserve currency.

Talking about when the yuan could play an equal role to other reserve currencies, Weidmann told an audience in Stuttgart that the convertibility of the currency was the crucial point and "that is not the case at them moment".
