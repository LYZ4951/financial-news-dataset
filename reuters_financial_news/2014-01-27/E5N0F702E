LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Brazilian central bank will fight the effects that the country's weakening currency has on inflation, central bank chief Alexandre Tombini said on Monday.

Tombini said in a speech in London that the bank has raised interest rates to fight inflation and weather new global financial conditions. The central bank raised rates by half a percentage point to 10.50 percent earlier this month, but signaled it may be ready to slow the pace of one of the world's most aggressive tightening cycles.
