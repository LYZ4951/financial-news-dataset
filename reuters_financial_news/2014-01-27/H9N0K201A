HONG KONG, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares tumbled to five-month lows on Monday, as a broad selloff in emerging markets escalated, taking a key benchmark further below a significant long-term technical level.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended down 2.1 percent at 21,976.1 points, its lowest closing level since Aug. 30. Losses on Monday also took the benchmark further below its 200-day moving average, now at 22,494.6 points. On Friday, it had closed below this level for the first time in nearly five months. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong sank 2.2 percent. The two benchmarks finished off the day's lows. [ID:nL3N0L1173] Some long-only investors started buying into Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> and some Macau gambling stocks, along with selected property and retail counters, helping to pare losses in those stocks, traders said. At $11.4 billion, Monday's turnover was the highest since Nov. 19.
