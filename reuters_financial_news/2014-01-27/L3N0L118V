JAKARTA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares fell as much as 3.4 percent on Monday, weighed down by the property and banking sectors, on expectations of more stimulus reduction by the U.S. Federal Reserve and worry about a slowing economy in China.

The Jakarta stock exchange <.JKSE> hit as low as 4,286.44 points, the weakest level since Jan. 10. At a low point Monday morning, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was down 1.6 percent.  Indonesian property stocks <.JKPROP> and financial counters <.JKFINA> dropped more than 3 percent. The biggest decliners included developers Bekasi Fajar Industrial Estate <BEST.JK> and Bumi Serpong Damai <BSDE.JK>, which plunged 8.6 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. "Today Indonesian shares were affected by what happened in the U.S and China, as well as the currency depreciation in other emerging countries," said Adrianus Bias Prasuryo, head of equity research at Samuel Sekuritas in Jakarta.
