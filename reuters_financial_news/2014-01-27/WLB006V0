LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. mobile operator AT&T <T.N> said on Monday it did not intend to make a takeover offer for Britain's Vodafone <VOD.L>, following months of speculation.

AT&T said it was making the statement at the request of the British takeover panel.  AT&T, the second-largest mobile provider in the United States, had said there was a "huge opportunity" to invest in mobile broadband in Europe, sparking speculation that it would buy Vodafone, the world's second largest mobile operator with assets in Europe, India and Africa.
