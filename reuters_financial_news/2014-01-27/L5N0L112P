LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Ukraine's 5-year credit default swaps rose to their highest level since mid-December on Monday as a fresh anti-government protest erupted in central Kiev.

The two-month standoff has sparked the worst violence in Ukraine since 1991. At least six people have been killed, according to the prosecutor's office and medics, and the crisis has deepened tension between Russia and the West [nL5N0L0089]. The 5-year CDS rose 67 basis points from Friday's close to 979 bps, the highest since before the country agreed a rescue package with Russia.
