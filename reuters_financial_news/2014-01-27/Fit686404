The relationship between the two companies follows a more strengthened in November 2013  when Axiata is committed to delivering shareholder loans amounting to  XL for $ 500 million to partially fund the acquisition of 95% stake in PT Axis  Telecom (Axis), the fifth largest mobile operator in Indonesia based on  revenue market share.
