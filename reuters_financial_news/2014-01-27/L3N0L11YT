TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average tumbled to a two-month low on Monday as the yen soared and global equities dropped on concerns about a selloff in emerging-market assets, dragging down futures and index-heavyweight stocks.

The Nikkei <.N225> ended 2.5 percent lower at 15,005.73, the lowest closing level since Nov. 14. It fell as much as 3 percent earlier.
