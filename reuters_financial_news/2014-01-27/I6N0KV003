MILAN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The top executive of Banca Popolare Emilia Romagna (BPER) <EMII.MI> said on Monday the Italian mid-tier lender had no plans for a rights issue and was adequately capitalised.

A surprise announcement of a 1.5 billion euro cash call by Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> has fuelled speculation on the market that others may join a growing queue of Italian lenders planning to tap shareholders for cash. Shares in BPER lost 6.4 percent by 1244 GMT at 6.99 euros, after falling to 6.795 euros, with analysts mentioning the lender as a possible candidate for a capital increase. "We regard our capitalisation levels as adequate," CEO Luigi Odorici told Reuters in a phone interview.  He said that the bank's core capital at end-2013 was above the 8 percent minimum threshold set by the European Central Bank, which is carrying out a review of euro zone lenders, including BPER.
