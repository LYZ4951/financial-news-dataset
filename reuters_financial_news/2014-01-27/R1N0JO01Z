MILAN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Bank of Italy said on Monday it had met with the top management of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena <BMPS.MI> and its main foundation shareholder to discuss prospects for a rapid capital increase at the bank.

"The meeting took place in a constructive climate," the Bank of Italy said in a statement. Loss-making Monte dei Paschi, which received 4.1 billion euros of state aid last year after being hit by the sovereign debt crisis and a derivatives scandal, is looking to raise 3 billion euros in fresh capital.
