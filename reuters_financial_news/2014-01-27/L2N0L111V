WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A unit of asset manager Legg Mason Inc <LM.N> will pay more than $21 million to settle a pair of civil cases with the U.S. government that accuse the company of hiding losses from investors in their retirement accounts and making certain trades that favored some clients over others.

The Securities and Exchange Commision and the U.S. Department of Labor jointly announced the settlement on Monday with the Legg Mason unit, Western Asset Management Company.
