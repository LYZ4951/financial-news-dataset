SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Seoul shares skidded 1.6 percent to a 5-month low on Monday, as investors were unnerved after a selloff in emerging markets gathered pace amid tighter credit condition in China and expectations of a further cut in the Federal Reserve's stimulus this week.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 1.6 percent at 1,910.34 points, its lowest close since Aug. 29. The KOSPI has fallen more than 5 percent so far in the year. Offshore investors sold a net 514.6 billion won ($476.3 million) worth of KOSPI shares, their biggest single day net selling since Dec. 12.
