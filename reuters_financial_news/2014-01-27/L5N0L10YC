KAMPALA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Ugandan shilling <UGX=> was marginally weaker on Monday after limited interbank demand but traders said foreign investors were expected to give the local currency a boost in the run-up to this week's treasury bond auction.

At 0808 GMT commercial banks quoted the currency of east Africa's third-largest economy at 2,473/2,483, a touch weaker than Friday's close of 2,470/2,480. "I have seen some light appetite (for dollars) in the interbank which accounts for the shilling's slight movement on the high (weaker) side," said Peter Mboowa, trader at KCB Uganda.  "But we're expecting the bond auction to give it support from the inflows that are likely to come from offshore buyers." The central Bank of Uganda is due to sell 130 billion shillings ($52.48 million) worth of re-opened three and new ten-year bonds on Wednesday. The local currency has had a bullish run this month on the back of depressed demand for dollars, although a BoU intervention on the buying side last week halted the gaining streak.
