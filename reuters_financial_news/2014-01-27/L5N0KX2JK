OSLO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Norwegian video game maker Funcom <FUNCOM.OL> is banking on an upcoming LEGO game to revive its fortunes after the failure of several expensive projects forced it to cut cost, lay off most staff and revamp its strategy, its CEO said.

Funcom, which has given up big and expensive games in favour of a larger number of smaller projects, said the development of the LEGO Minifigures Online games is on track, ready for monetized beta testing from the summer, allowing the firm to earn revenues from the start, Chief Executive Ole Schreiner told Reuters. "The LEGO game is looking very good, and we have achieved all the milestones in terms of game development", Schreiner said. Funcom was close to the brink in 2012 after its "Age of Conan" and "The Secret World" games in the so-called massively multiplayer online or MMO category failed to perform according to expectations, sending the stock from a high of 24 crowns in April 2012 to a low of around 1 crown within months. The firm shed most of its workforce, cutting staff from 500 to around 130 today and quitting the development of big projects, limiting investments to a range of $2 million to $8 million from as high at $50 million for some of its failed investments. "We are now much better equipped to face the future. We have control of our costs and we see that the income side is where we have estimated it to be," Schreiner said. "Our new strategy is to create smaller but more focused online games and to produce and deliver them much faster. We want to have more bets in the market and thus increasing our chance of success," Schreiner added. The share has also respondsed and the stock has been the best performer on the Oslo bourse in the past three months, rising 213 percent to around 5 crowns. Now Schreiner hopes that its work with LEGO, one of the best known toy brands, will increase its exposure. The game will be free to download and available on most platforms like Android and iOS, with Funcom hoping for a return from transactions within the game and through memberships.  "These games have a very long life span. This allows us to build revenue streams on top of each other that gives us a good income base for the future", said Schreiner. The company has a long-term goal of delivering one or two games a year.
