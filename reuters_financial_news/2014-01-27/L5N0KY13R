ISTANBUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - With earnings already hammered by slowing loan growth, Turkish banks face further challenges this year as rising interest rates and mounting inflation are compounded by a deepening political crisis.

Turkey's measures to limit credit card and mortgage debt - once a rapid growth engine for the country's banks - have eroded earnings for banks, such as Garanti <GARAN.IS> and Akbank <AKBNK.IS>, at a time when confidence in the country's businesses has been rocked by a damaging corruption scandal. The sector could be looking at a 5 percent drop in earnings this year, said Credit Suisse analyst, Ates Buldur. "Uncertainties around domestic politics and the interest rates outlook prevent us from building an investment case based on a potential sharp earnings recovery in 2015." Alarmed investors have fled Turkish assets as a high-level graft case engulfed swathes of Turkey's government, civil service and judiciary, hastening an exit that began with the  reduction in U.S. monetary stimulus. The upheaval blights the outlook for 2014 and poses one of the biggest threats to Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's 11-year rule. The lira plunged to record lows, heightening investor concerns and putting further pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates, pressure it has so far resisted for fear of slowing growth ahead of local elections in March and presidential polls due in August. Rising interest rates will further squeeze the sector's earnings, squelching demand from borrowers. Turkey's central bank is expected to raise its overnight lending rate by 225 basis points to 10 percent at an emergency monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 31 economists. [ID:nL5N0L12WD]  COOLING MEASURES Turkey introduced measures last year to make it harder for consumers to accrue more credit card debt than they can afford, leading banks to shun credit card lending, which was once a rapid growth engine. Ankara wants to limit consumer loan growth and lift the domestic savings rate, in order to help reduce the gaping current account deficit. These cooling measures are likely to lead to a sharp fall in earnings. Garanti, part-owned by Spain's BBVA <BBVA.MC>, is expected to report an 18 percent fall in fourth quarter net profit to 620 million lira ($270 million) mainly due to these  Akbank was expected to report a 34 percent drop in its net profit to 710 million lira in the fourth quarter after recording trading losses.  Isbank <ISCTR.IS>, Turkey's largest listed bank by assets, was expected to see net profit fall 42 percent compared to the same period in 2012 due to declining trading gains and higher provisions.  State-run Halkbank's <HALKB.IS> net profit was seen dropping 6 percent to 699 million lira in the same period of last year.  Net profit for lender Yapi Kredi <YKBNK.IS> was expected to fall 11 percent to 457 million lira as trading income declined.  Vakifbank <VAKBN.IS> was expected to report a 10 percent decline in its net profit in the last quarter to 404 million lira.
