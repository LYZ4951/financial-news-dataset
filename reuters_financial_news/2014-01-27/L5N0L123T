MADRID, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Spain's Santander <SAN.MC> bank, which is making a big push in the United States, has appointed the former head of the U.S. deposit guarantee fund, Sheila Blair, as an independent board member, it said on Monday.

Blair, who ran the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) from 2006 to 2011, will replace Terence Burns, who stepped down from Santander's group level board earlier this month. He remains the chairman of the bank's business in Britain, however.
