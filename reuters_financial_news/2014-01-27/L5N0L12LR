CAIRO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank accepted bids worth $1.5 billion, the whole amount it had offered, at a cut off price of 6.9518 Egyptian pounds at a foreign currency auction on Monday.

The bank said it would sell the $1.5 billion from its foreign reserves to cover strategic imports such as wheat, meat and cooking oil, in its largest ever exceptional currency auction. [ID:nL5N0L10MK]
