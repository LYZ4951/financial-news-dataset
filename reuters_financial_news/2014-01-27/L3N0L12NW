SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank said on Monday that China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange would allow it to invest an additional $300 million in Chinese stocks under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) scheme.    The central bank won initial approval in the QFII program in March 2012 with a quota of $300 million.    China granted $3.4 billion in fresh quotas to licensed overseas institutional investors this month as of Jan. 27, according to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Monday.
