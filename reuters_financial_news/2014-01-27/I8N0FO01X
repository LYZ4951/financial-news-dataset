MUMBAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India's NSE share index <.NSEI> fell as much as 2.1 percent on Monday and headed towards its biggest daily since Sept. 3 as a rout in emerging markets hit blue chips, while lenders were hit further by caution ahead of the central bank's policy review.

ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> fell 4.5 percent, while HDFC Bank Ltd <HDBK.NS> was down 3.5 percent. Tata Motors Ltd <TAMO.NS> fell 6.1 percent after the automaker's managing director, Karl Slym, died when he fell from a hotel room in Bangkok in what police said on Monday could be a possible suicide. [ID:nI8N0FO01W] The broader NSE index <.NSEI> was down 2.05 percent at 0926 GMT, heading for its biggest fall since a 3.8 percent fall on Sept. 3 when domestic shares were hit by worries about military tensions in Syria.
