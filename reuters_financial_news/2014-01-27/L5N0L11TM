MOSCOW, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Russia's biggest food retailer, Magnit <MGNT.MM>, on Monday cut its full-year 2014 sales growth guidance, citing a lower inflation outlook, but pledged to raise its dividend payout.

"We can adjust our guidance to 22-24 percent, closer to the upper end (of the range)," Chief Executive Officer Sergei Galitskiy told a conference call. The company earlier forecast sales growth of around 25 percent this year.
