NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures inched higher on Monday, setting Wall Street up for a modest rebound after its worst week since June 2012 with investors focused on corporate earnings from big names like Caterpillar and Apple.

* Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N> shares jumped 4.5 percent in premarket trade after the bellwether reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results. [ID:WNAB0420F] * Apple Inc <AAPL.O> is due to report earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The iPhone and iPad maker may notch its most successful holiday shopping season yet, setting records for sales of its gift-friendly iPhones and iPads. It will, however, continue to draw investor scrutiny over sales in ultra-competitive China, its No. 2 market but a drag on revenue and margins in recent quarters.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  U.S. Morning Call:   Caterpillar digs up a profit; Apple on tap http://reut.rs/M3V4rC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  * In economic news, the Commerce Department's new homes sales numbers for December are due at 10:00 a.m. ET. The Dallas Fed's manufacturing survey data is due at 10:30 a.m. ET.  * Investors will begin to heavily consider the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting that begins on Tuesday. * Concerns that the Fed may further taper its stimulus measures have been one of the major reasons for a recent selloff in the stock market. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 2.6 percent for the week, closing below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 9, suggesting more selling may be ahead for the market that closed out 2013 with a 30-percent gain.  * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> rose 9.1 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures <DJc1> rose 60 points and Nasdaq 100 futures <NDc1> added 10.75 points. * U.S. mobile group AT&T <T.N> has ruled out a bid for Britain's Vodafone <VOD.L> for now, with banking sources saying a U.S. spying scandal and a surge in European telecom shares may have disrupted a deal that many think could still happen. U.S.-listed shares of Vodafone <VOD.O> fell 4.7 percent in premarket trade.
