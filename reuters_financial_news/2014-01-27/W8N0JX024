WARSAW, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Poland's economic growth will exceed three percent in 2014, reaching four percent in the second half of the year, Monetary Policy Member Jerzy Hausner said on Monday.

The former communist country has posted nearly two decades of uninterrupted growth but its economy began to slow sharply last year and growth fell to near zero in the first quarter of 2013 to regain pace in the following quarters.
