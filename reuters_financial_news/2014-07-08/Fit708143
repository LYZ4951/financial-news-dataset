July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings said that a total of 33 publicly rated tranches from non-Japan Asia structured finance (SF) transactions were affirmed in 2Q14 as asset performance continued to be within the agency's expectations.   The affirmation of 26 tranches from 21 Indian auto loan ABS transactions  reflected Fitch's view that the performance of the underlying assets has  remained within expectations, and that credit enhancement is sufficient to  support the current ratings. Delinquencies had risen markedly between end-2013  and early 2014, a factor that resulted in the outlooks assigned to four tranches  being revised to Negative from Stable during 2Q14; arrears have since  stabilised. Five Korean ABS tranches were affirmed in 2Q14, three from auto ABS transactions  and two from credit card transactions. The auto loan transactions have adequate  credit enhancement and low delinquencies and defaults. Of the two credit card  tranches affirmed during the quarter, one was subsequently redeemed in full. All  of the outstanding transactions that were reviewed in 2Q14 have entered their  respective controlled amortisation periods. The affirmation of class A from Emerald Assets Limited Series P1-AAA-002, a  Singapore CMBS transaction backed by, reflected strong cash flow, adequate  occupancy levels and debt service coverage ratio. The transaction subsequently  paid in full.  Finally, the rating of the notes from Eirles Two Series 364 were affirmed,  although the Outlook was revised to Negative from Stable, reflecting a previous  rating action on Deutsche Bank, AG <DBKGn.DE> (DB; A+/Negative/F1+).
