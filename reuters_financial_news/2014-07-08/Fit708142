July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says publicly rated structured finance (SF) and structured credit (SC) transactions monitored by its Japanese SF team remained mostly stable in 2Q14, with 11 rating affirmations, two upgrades and three downgrades.. The two upgrades were mezzanine BIs 2 and 3 of Shinsei TB Fund 7976001, an RMBS  transaction. The rating actions reflected growth in credit enhancement (CE)  levels due to principal redemptions of the senior classes and Fitch's  expectation that asset performance will continue to be stable. The 11 affirmations reflected Fitch's view that available CE is sufficient to  support the current ratings. The affirmations were for seven tranches from three  RMBS transactions, two ABCP programmes, one multi-borrower CMBS tranche and a  Thai credit card ABS tranche. The class C TBIs of JLOC XXX Trust and class 1 and 2 mezzanine TBIs of JLOC XXX  Satellite Trust, were downgraded to 'Dsf' from 'Csf' and simultaneously  withdrawn. The rating actions on these CMBS transactions followed the principal  loss on the TBIs, resulting from completion of the workout on a defaulted  underlying loan.
