July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has begun to systematically publish the  components of breakeven overcollaterisation (OC) levels for its covered bond  ratings. The three components are credit loss, cash flow valuation and asset  disposal loss.  "The components will provide a standardised way of expressing Fitch's opinion on  the drivers of breakeven overcollaterisation for a covered bond rating," says  Helene Heberlein, Managing Director of Covered Bonds at Fitch. "The components  constitute complementary information alongside ratings, enabling market  participants to directly compare quantitative risks across various programmes."  The breakeven OC components reveal extra detail above and beyond credit loss  expectations for the cover pool in a stressed scenario corresponding to the  covered bond rating, which Fitch already publishes for the programmes it rates.  "Credit loss is only part of the story. With access to all three components,  investors will gain a more complete picture of our view on the risks the  programmes face after recourse shifts to the cover pool," says Suzanne Albers,  Senior Director of Covered Bonds.  Fitch will graphically present the figures in reports for individual programmes  and will supply them in its surveillance pages at www.fitchratings.com, press  releases and the Covered Bonds Surveillance Snapshot. Fitch believes the components will be most useful in benchmarking individual  programmes relative to the programmes most similar to them, such as with the  same rating, jurisdictions and cover asset types.
