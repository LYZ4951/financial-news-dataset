July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says Rosy Blue International S.A.'s (Rosy  Blue) commercial paper has been fully redeemed and paid in full. The agency has received confirmation from Standard Chartered Bank [STANB.UL] (AA-/Stable/F1+), Rosy Blue's liquidity and hedge provider and account bank,  that the Rosy Blue programme will be terminated during 2014 and that no further  CP will be issued. Rosy Blue currently finances trade receivables arising from the sale of rough  and polished diamonds originated by Rosy Blue N.V. through drawings on the  funding loan available through a liquidity line. The trade receivables may also  be financed through CP issuance; however, the last issue was in November 2010  and repaid in December 2010.
