WARSAW, July 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Polish railway builder Torpol <TORa.WA> rose almost 7 percent at their Warsaw bourse <GPW.WA> debut on Tuesday after the company's initial public offering (IPO) worth 184 million zlotys ($60.4 million).

Following their initial peak of 8.55 zlotys each, the shares traded at 8.35 zlotys each at 0714 GMT, compared to the IPO price of 8.0 zlotys. Torpol used to be fully owned by Poland's troubled construction group Polimex <PXMP.WA>. The builder sold the unit to raise money for debt repayments and current building contracts. Torpol expects to almost double its sales this year to 801 million zlotys compared with the year before. Net profit is seen five times larger at 25 million, according to the IPO prospectus.
