HONG KONG, July 8 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares finished flat on Tuesday, as gains in utilities  offset losses in Macau casino stocks on concerns that revenues would suffer as gamblers focused on the final week of the World Cup.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed barely changed at 23,541.38 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong was up 0.2 percent. Among Macau gaming stocks, Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> shed 2.7 percent and Wynn Macau <1128.HK> 1.4 percent. Barclays said in a note on Tuesday it expects total gross gaming revenue in July to decline 6 percent from a year earlier. Li & Fung <0494.HK> dropped 1.5 percent, snapping a 9-day winning streak, ahead of the listing of its new unit Global Brands Group <0787.HK> on Wednesday after a spin-off.
