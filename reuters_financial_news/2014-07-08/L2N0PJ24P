NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc <C.N> and the U.S. Department of Justice are close to a multi-billion dollar settlement over allegations that the bank sold shoddy mortgages in the run-up to the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday.

The settlement could be announced as soon as next week, and would cost Citigroup more than $4 billion, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter.
