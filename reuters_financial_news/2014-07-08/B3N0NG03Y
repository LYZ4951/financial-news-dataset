BUDAPEST, July 8 (Reuters) - New Hungarian legislation to compensate borrowers for unvavourable interest rates will require "material capital injections" from the foreign parents of banks operating the country, ratings agency Fitch said on Tuesday.

Fitch said Hungarian banks would need this additional capital to restore regulatory capital and lending capacity. Under a law passed on Friday, banks in Hungary must compensate clients for unfavourable past interest rate adjustments and charges on loans. [ID:nL6N0PF3PS]
