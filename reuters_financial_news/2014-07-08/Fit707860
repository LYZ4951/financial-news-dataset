July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has assigned Czech Republic-based NET4GAS,  s.r.o.'s Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' and its proposed notes  expected senior unsecured rating of 'BBB(EXP)'. The Outlook on the Long-term IDR  is Positive.  The notes' final rating is contingent on receipt of final documentation  materially conforming to documents already received.  NET4GAS' rating is supported by its strong business profile as the sole national  gas transmission system owner and operator (TSO) in the Czech Republic and its  long-term ship or pay transit contracts for Russian gas to Europe, but with  limited exposure to the route across Ukraine. The rating is constrained by the  uncertainty around the next price control determination for its domestic  business, with other key drivers including counterparty concentration in the  transit business, and financial policies (flexible dividends, FX exposure  management) commensurate with the rating.  The Positive Outlook reflects that we expect NET4GAS to achieve and maintain  credit metrics commensurate with our positive rating guideline supportive of an  upgrade, for example funds from operations (FFO) net adjusted leverage below  5.25x. However, an upgrade would be a subject to a final regulatory  determination supporting predictability of the framework.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Refocused Transit Business Dominates Cash Flows  We expect NET4GAS' transit business, representing around 80% of its revenues, to  remain the company's key cash flow driver. With the 2013 commissioning of the  Gazelle pipeline which indirectly connects the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia  to Germany's southern TSOs, NET4GAS has turned its traditional position on the  east to west gas route into one focused on north to south and west to east  flows. Around 85% of its long-term booked capacities are in these directions,  limiting its exposure to the route across Ukraine. A growing number of  short-term contracts remain a small, but high margin cash flow source given  NET4GAS' high operating leverage.  Strong Contractual Terms We understand that Nord Stream/Gazelle is an economically competitive route for  OAO Gazprom <GAZP.MM> (BBB/Negative) given Gazprom's ownership interest in the Nord Stream  pipeline. The six existing contracts supporting bulk of the transit revenues are  long term, with only one contract expiring during the next five years. The  contracts typically include a full ship or pay provision (except for Gazelle),  where the shipper pays the agreed capacity payments irrespective of the actual  volumes shipped. The contracts contain hardship and force majeure features  either contractually or as a matter of Czech or Austrian law. The most  significant obligation on the shipper is to pay transit fees which is less  likely to be avoidable through force majeure than an operational obligation.   Limited Exposure to Ukraine  Russia stopped supplying gas to Ukraine on 16 June 2014, however, transit flows  across Ukraine in the direction of Slovakia and the Czech Republic continue  unaffected to date. We believe that the route is needed should supplies of EU  countries continue unaffected come the next heating season. Fitch does not  assess NET4GAS to be vulnerable in a scenario where a failure to resolve the gas  supply arrangements between Russia and Ukraine lead to a significantly prolonged  halt of gas transit across Ukraine, given NET4GAS' diversification away from the  traditional east to west or "Brotherhood corridor" which passes via Ukraine and  also considering the contractual terms in the transit contracts. We assess a  scenario of escalating tensions between Russia and the European Union leading to  pressure on renegotiation of NET4GAS' key contracts prior to their maturity or  affecting performance under the contracts as unlikely.  Long Term Route Competition We believe that there is a limited pressure on NET4GAS' existing contract  portfolio to change materially even if one assumes a rapid progress on the South  Stream project because this would initially focus on south European markets  which are not currently supplied through NET4GAS (Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania,  Greece, Macedonia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia). However, combined with structural  shifts in the gas markets (current shift away from gas fired power production in  Europe, and an increase in gas market liquidity and globalisation supported by  US shale gas and global LNG growth) it will likely co-determine NET4GAS'  long-term contractual base in the coming decade.  Concentration of Contracts  We do not see the company's direct exposure to Gazprom as the largest  counterparty as a constraint for the ratings due to historical performance under  the contracts and the higher unconstrained credit profile of the counterparty  and also the remaining counterparty diversification. Other counterparties  include large European utilities. All counterparties (transit or domestic) have  to meet the criteria of the network code and payments are typically made on  advance invoices. The regulatory framework allows recovery of revenue deficits  in the domestic business.   Less Risky Domestic Business  While we view the transit business as highly cash-generative, there is a  long-term risk of stranded transit capacity/assets due to potentially weak  demand for natural gas in Europe and/or competing delivery routes or sources.  Fitch therefore views the transit business with original design capacity likely  higher than future needs (and without return on replacement value and investment  recovery guaranteed by the regulator) as riskier than the domestic transport  business.  Price Control Proposal Constrains the Rating  We view the regulatory environment in the Czech Republic as relatively  transparent, albeit at an earlier stage of maturity compared with that of some  other European countries, and generally supportive of strong investment grade  ratings. Transmission represents less than 1% of end-user gas bills in the Czech  Republic, suggesting that affordability should not be a regulatory concern  there. However the uncertainty over the allowed value of the regulatory asset  base (RAB) proposed for the transmission remuneration in the fourth regulatory  period (RP4) planned for 2015 - 2019 constrains the rating. The final decision  on RP4 may be delayed and the third regulatory period (RP3) may be extended.  RAB Uncertainty The regulator proposed to eliminate the impact of a 2005 asset revaluation and  effectively reduce RAB and allowed depreciation (allowed return would be less  affected due to a RAB correction factor of around 0.5x already used for the  calculation and proposed increase in weighted average cost of capital (WACC)).  The debate around the level of RAB and its potential changes create regulatory  uncertainty (significant stakeholders oppose the proposal). The low value of the  allowed RAB versus the book value is a common issue among eastern European  countries and some of the regimes accommodate a gradual revaluation in their  methodologies. In our view, a further distancing from the replacement value of  the asset base which is proposed by the regulator would undermine the progress  of the regulatory framework development from the credit perspective.  Historically Volatile WACC, Supportive Proposal Significant decrease in the risk free rate (taken as 12-month average 10 year  government bond yield) and the low threshold for WACC re-opener (+/-0.2% in the  rate) contributed to a significant volatility and fall in WACC for NET4GAS over  RP3 from 8% (before tax) to 5.5%. We view the high volatility of the allowed  return during the third regulatory period is uncharacteristic for strategic  infrastructure industries which require long term visibility. However, the  proposal is for a fixed rate of 8.2% for RP4 with a high re-opener threshold of  50% change of the previous level, and this would support long-term visibility of  NET4GAS' earnings.  Good Asset Base and Operations Fitch views NET4GAS' asset base quality as average to good and notes that  NET4GAS maintains it to a high standard with operations without single  interruption of supply or accidents causing fatalities or material damage over  the past 20 years.  Conservative Forecast Assumptions Despite the expectation that the gas market liquidity will increase with added  interconnectors (to Poland in 2011) and with effective reversal of flows, we  have removed all short-term transit revenues from our forecasts from 2015 and  much of the volume exposure on Gazelle, to eliminate identifiable volume risk  from our assessment of credit metrics and comparison with other TSOs that are  typically fully remunerated on RAB. We have also assumed the regulator's  proposals for the domestic business (i.e. a downside on current remuneration).  Short term contract based revenues and a more favourable regulatory  determination thus represent an upside for additional cash flows and the latter  also for the rating.  Comfortable Credit Metrics  Flexible Dividends Although the impact on the credit metrics may not be significant (partially due  to the flexible dividend policy), the current regulatory proposal for RP4 RAB  may, if confirmed, affect our view of the regulatory framework predictability  and the overall final determination remains uncertain. Our modelling assumes a  significant degree of dividend payout flexibility as directed by the  shareholders (Allianz and Borealis who confirmed that absolute dividends would  not be maintained if cash flows are weaker than expected), however, there is no  long-term track record for NET4GAS or proposed covenants in this respect.  Debt Capacity Higher than eustream Considering our business risk assessment of NET4GAS, we view its debt capacity  for a given rating as lower than that of a fully regulated national TSO with  limited exposure to market risks, but higher compared with eustream, a.s.  (A-/Stable).  FX Exposure Most transit capacity is contracted in dollar, followed by Czech koruna (which  is also the currency for the domestic business) and euro. Costs are largely in  koruna with some capex in FX. NET4GAS will target debt denomination to increase  natural currency hedge, but also employ cross currency swaps to hedge the  exposure. NET4GAS will target at least 70% fixed rate debt.   Senior Unsecured Debt  We typically rate senior unsecured debt of regulated networks utilities (with  over 50% of earnings from these networks) in developed markets one notch above  the IDR. In the case of NET4GAS only around 20% of earnings originate from the  revenue cap domestic transmission business. We do not apply the same recovery  assumption to the price cap regulated transit business of NET4GAS because its  long term valuation is not supported by the regulation and it is exposed to  NET4GAS' long-term competitive position in the European gas networks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include: - Projected FFO net adjusted leverage sustainably below 5.25x and FFO coverage  above 3.5x, together with better predictability and visibility in the domestic  business. Looking through the weaker metrics due to increased capex in 2017 and  2018, we view NET4GAS' financial profile as strong for the rating, however this  is now constrained by the uncertainty of the ongoing RP4 consultation process.  RP4 determination supporting the continuity of allowed RAB and predictability of  the framework would likely lead to an upgrade.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Projected FFO net adjusted leverage at above 6.0x and FFO coverage at below  2.5x on a sustained basis, due to, for example, higher initial debt, an  aggressive dividend policy or significant operational underperformance  (uncompensated capex, opex overspend). - Adverse change in NET4GAS' contract portfolio or failure to of counterparties  to perform under the contracts.  - Significant weakening of unconstrained credit profile and increase in exposure  to NET4GAS' key counterparty. - RP4 determination undermining the continuity of allowed RAB and predictability  of the framework would likely read to a revision of the Outlook to Stable at the  current rating level.
