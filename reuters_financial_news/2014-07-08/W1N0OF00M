July 8 (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday he expects U.S. economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, with inflation pressures remaining "well-behaved."

But Lacker said that at some stage the economy will have improved enough that banks could increase lending substantially, leading to rapid deposit growth and mounting inflationary pressures.
