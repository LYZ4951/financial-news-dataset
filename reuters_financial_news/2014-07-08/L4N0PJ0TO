SEOUL, July 8 (Reuters) - South Korean shares ended little changed on Tuesday, shrugging off weak earnings guidance from Samsung Electronics.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed up 0.1 percent at 2,006.66 points, after falling to as low as 1,997.87, the lowest intraday level since July 1.  Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> said its operating profit probably fell 24.5 percent during the second quarter to 7.2 trillion won ($7.12 billion), below the 8.3 trillion won forecast of Thomson Reuters poll.[ID:nL4N0PI01A] Its shares, however, edged up 0.2 percent on short covering. The stock had suffered heavy selling in recent sessions on concerns about competition from cheaper, Chinese rivals. The won <KRW=> eased for a third straight day against the dollar, extending losses near the market close as the finance minister nominee expressed concern over the currency's rapid appreciation at a parliamentary verification hearing.[ID:nL4N0PI4PC]
