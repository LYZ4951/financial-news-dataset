MUMBAI, July 8 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell more than 2 percent on Tuesday, marking their biggest single-day fall in over 10 months as a lower-than-expected railway budget outlay sparked worries about subdued government expenditure in the federal budget due on Thursday.

Among blue-chips, Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> fell 4.2 percent while Reliance Industries <RELI.NS> lost 3.2 percent.
