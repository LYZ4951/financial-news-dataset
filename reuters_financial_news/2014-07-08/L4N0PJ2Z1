TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - Japan's Financial Services Agency will beef up its supervision of asset management companies, three people involved in the matter said on Tuesday, in the wake of a scandal in which a fund manager lost more than $1 billion in pension money.

The FSA will set up a dedicated team to supervise the industry, the sources said, adding that an announcement is expected on Wednesday.
