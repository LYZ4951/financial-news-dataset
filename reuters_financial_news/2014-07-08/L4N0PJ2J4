July 8 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings revised up its outlook on New Zealand's sovereign ratings to "positive" from "stable", saying fiscal consolidation is strengthening the resilience of New Zealand's credit profile.

New Zealand's business environment, standards of governance, and economic policy framework warrant high-grade sovereign ratings, Fitch said on Tuesday. [ID:nFit708029]
