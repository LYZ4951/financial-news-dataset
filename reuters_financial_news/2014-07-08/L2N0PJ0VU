SAO PAULO, July 8 (Reuters) - Brazil's state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL] said on Tuesday that Portugal Telecom SGPS SA's <PTC.LS> bond deal with investment company Rioforte is "inconsistent with minimum standards of good corporate governance."

BNDES said in a statement it requested detailed information on the Rioforte deal, adding that it will seek to protect the interests of Grupo Oi SA's <OIBR3.SA> shareholders. Oi claimed last week that Portugal Telecom did not disclose an investment in Rioforte, which is held by a key shareholder under investigation in Luxembourg. [ID:nL6N0P83PG] Oi and Portugal Telecom are currently in the process of merging their businesses.
