LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc <BARC.L> has appointed Reid Marsh as co-head of investment banking in Asia-Pacific and promoted Gary Posternack to global head of mergers and acquisitions, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Mark Warham, head of M&A in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, will leave the bank, the source said. Matthew Ponsonby will lead EMEA M&A coverage, in addition to his role as co-chief operating officer of investment banking. The moves follow the appointment of Tom King as head of investment banking in April.
