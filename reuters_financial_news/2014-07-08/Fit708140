July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says 195 Asia-Pacific structured finance (SF) tranches were affirmed in 2Q14; the remaining rating actions were seven upgrades and three downgrades. Of the total affirmations, 77 were from Australia, which also contributed five  of the upgrades during the quarter. Asset performance was supported by continued  robust economic performance. The upgrades were made to prime RMBS and unsecured  consumer loan ABS, where a build-up of credit enhancement supports the higher  ratings. Two Japanese prime RMBS tranches were upgraded by one notch each. All three  downgrades in the region were Japanese CMBS tranches that defaulted and the  ratings were simultaneously withdrawn. Fitch's SF team in Tokyo also affirmed  seven Japanese prime RMBS tranches, two ABCP programmes, one multi-borrower CMBS  tranche and 1 Thai credit card tranche.  A total of 33 publicly rated tranches from non-Japan Asia SF transactions were  affirmed in 2Q14 as asset performance continued to be within the agency's  expectations. Indian auto loan ABS accounted for most of the quarter's rating  actions, at 26. Delinquencies had risen markedly between end-2013 and early  2014, a factor that resulted in the outlooks assigned to four tranches being  revised to Negative from Stable during 2Q14; arrears have subsequently  stabilised. Elsewhere in the region, five Korean ABS tranches, one Singapore  CMBS tranche and one structured credit tranche were affirmed during the quarter.  The Outlook on the latter was revised to Negative from Stable, reflecting a  previous rating action on a transaction counterparty. Stable Outlooks continued to dominate as of 30 June 2014. There were nine  Positive Outlooks and six Negative Outlooks.
