BANGKOK, July 8 (Reuters) - Indonesia's benchmark scaled a seven-week high on Tuesday on foreign inflows ahead of Wednesday's elections while the Malaysian index hit an all-time high intra-day as the ringgit rose on expectations of a policy rate hike this week.

A rally in shares of Bank Rakyat <BBRI.JK> and Bank Negara Indonesia <BBNI.JK> amid foreign-led buying brought Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> to 5,050.56, its highest since May 19, according to Thomson Reuters data. Indonesia's presidential election could be the last chance for old-style politicians to lead what is one of the world's biggest democracies, and one of its youngest.

The Indonesian rupiah <.IDR=ID> advanced, but pared most of its gains because of growing uncertainty over the presidential election with some opinion polls showing the race now too close to call. [ID:nL4N0PJ0GS] Kuala Lumpur's composite index <.KLSE> was up 0.03 percent at 1,893.14, having touched a record high of 1,896.23 intra-day. The ringgit rose to its highest in more than seven months on Tuesday. [ID:nL4N0PJ0GS] Malaysia's central bank is expected to raise its key interest rate to 3.25 percent at a policy meeting on Thursday, a Reuters poll showed. [ID:nB9N0ND00Y] Banking stocks such as Hong Leong Bank <HLBB.KL> and Malayan Banking <MBBM.KL> led among gainers. The Thai index <.SETI> earlier hit an intraday high of 1,512.57, a near one-year high, led by banks as the sector is due to report quarterly results from next week. Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> and Krung Thai Bank <KTB.BK> led among gainers. Other markets eased as Asian stocks tracked sideways, with  Singapore <.FTSTI> reversing Monday's rise, while the Philippines <.PSI> fell after a three-day rally and Vietnam <.VNI> slid on profit-taking.
