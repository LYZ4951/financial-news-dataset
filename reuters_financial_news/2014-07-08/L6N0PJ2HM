July 8 (Reuters) -    ** HeidelbergCement <HEIG.DE> might buy the U.S. & French cement plants that Lafarge <LAFP.PA> & Holcim <HOLN.VX> end up divesting in order to get the regulatory OK for their deal, according to Jefferies.

** Lafarge <LAFP.PA> and Holcim on July 7 unveiled a multi-billion euro list of proposed asset sales. [ID:nL6N0PI0VX] ** Jefferies said in a note that HeidelbergCement managers told analysts during a capital markets day event on July 2 in California that the potential merger would be a "once in a generation" opportunity to acquire assets. ** CEO Bernd Scheifele and CFO Lorenz Naeger were among the executives who spoke that day. ** Managers also said HeidelbergCement would finance any purchase from proceeds of planned divestment of the Building Products business, its cash flow and potentially by taking on additional debt, but would not issue equity. ** A spokesman for HeidelbergCement declined comment.
