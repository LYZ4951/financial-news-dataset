NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Wall Street's self-regulator said on Tuesday it has conducted examinations of 10 firms to ensure they are in compliance with regulations requiring that investors receive the best execution for their stock orders.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority did not disclose which 10 firms received letters demanding records and other documents on their execution and order-routing practices, but FINRA posted a sample letter on its website explaining its examination process.
