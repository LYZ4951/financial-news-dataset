KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 (Reuters) - Malaysian stationary maker Pelikan International Corporation Bhd <PELK.KL> plans to list some of its units and assets in Germany in a move that will raise at least 491.3 million ringgit ($154.98 million), it said on Tuesday.

The proposed listing - to be done via private placements and offers for sale - will include an asset injection into the company and its 96.45 percent-owned Switzerland unit Pelikan Holding AG <PEL.S> into Herlitz AG <HEZG.G> for 1.19 billion ringgit.  In return, Pelikan will receive 266 million new shares in Frankfurt listed Herlitz, of which Pelikan now holds a 70.92 percent stake, according to a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.  The deals will allow Pelikan to unlock the value of its various stationary businesses and provide funds for growth, the company said.  Pelikan also proposed a private placement of up to 50 million Herlitz shares, at a minimum offer price of one euro each, and the offer for sale of up to 30 million Herlitz shares, by Pelikan and its Switzerland unit Pelikan AG.
