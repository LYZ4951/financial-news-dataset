SINGAPORE, July 8 (Reuters) - Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd [TEM.UL] said its portfolio grew by 3.72 percent in the last financial year, slower than the previous year, due to a drop in the value of its bank holdings which include Standard Chartered PLC <STAN.L>.

Temasek reported on Tuesday its portfolio size had increased to a record S$223 billion ($179 billion) in its last financial year that ended in March. Last financial year, Temasek's portfolio grew 8.6 percent.
