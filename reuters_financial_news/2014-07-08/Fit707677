July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Retail Automotive  CP Germany 2013 UG's EUR370.4m class A notes (XS0947169347): at 'AAAsf' with a  Stable Outlook. The transaction is a EUR400m portfolio of multi-brand auto loan receivables  originated by CreditPlus Bank AG in Germany. The bank is a direct subsidiary of  CA Consumer Finance [CAGRSO.UL], thus part of the Credit Agricole group (A/Stable/F1).  KEY RATING DRIVERS Asset performance is in line with Fitch's assumptions. As of end-May 2014,  cumulative defaults and cumulative losses were at 21bp and 13bp, respectively.  Fitch notes that these figures are somewhat skewed to the downside by the  purchase of additional performing assets during the revolving period.  Nevertheless, even excluding the newly purchased assets, the performance of the  transaction is in line with our expectations. The transaction will enter its amortisation phase in on the interest payment  date in August 2014. Over the 12-month revolving period, portfolio composition  by product types has evolved and is slightly better than the agency's  stressed  expectations.  Credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes is provided by  overcollateralisation and a fully-funded cash reserve and is currently 8.4%  (unchanged since closing). Due to the rapid amortisation of the portfolio and  strictly sequential note amortisation, CE is expected to increase rapidly.  So far, all defaults have been provisioned for by excess spread via a principal  deficiency ledger (PDL). However, Fitch notes that the default definition is  relatively late, usually at some 150 days past due. This reduces the amount of  receivables that can be debited to the PDL. Delinquencies are relatively low at  some 24bps as of end-May 2014, supported by the benign macro-economic  environment.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Expected impact upon the class A notes' rating of increased defaults and reduced  recoveries:
