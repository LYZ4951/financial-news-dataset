BANGKOK, July 8 (Reuters) - Indonesian shares hit their highest closing level in nearly eight weeks on Tuesday, helped by foreign investors-led buying in large caps and banking stocks, while the Philippine index fell after four days of gains as domestic investors cashed in on recent gainers.

Jakarta's composite index <.JKSE> advanced for a third day and closed 0.7 percent higher at 5,024.71, the highest close since May 16, as foreign investors bought a net 1.57 trillion rupiah worth shares, their highest in nearly three weeks. <VMFIN.JK> Shares of Bank Rakyat Indonesia <BBRI.JK> surged 6 percent to an all-time high, while Bank Mandiri <BMRI.JK> and Astra International <ASII.JK> led among the actively traded stocks. The Philippine index <.PSI> fell 0.7 percent to close at 6,948.5 amid profit-taking in recent gainers such as property stocks.  Ayala Land <ALI.PS> fell 1.4 percent while Megaworld <MEG.PS> dropped 0.21 percent. The Thai SET index <.SETI> extended gain for a ninth day, hitting its highest level in nearly one year, amid economic optimism after an upbeat view by the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB).  "There is a chance that the economy could grow 2.5 percent," NESDB Secretary-General Arkom Termpitayapaisit told reporters after a meeting with the ruling military government's National Council for Peace and Order on Tuesday. NESDB said its 2014 GDP growth projection was 1.5-2.5 percent. Singapore <.FTSTI> eased 0.25 percent, reversing Monday's rise to an over three-week high. Vietnam <.VNI> rose for its fifth straight session while Malaysia <.KLSE> eked out more gain, marking an all-time high for a second day.
