July 8 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

The potentially high costs of a new law requiring  Hungarian banks to compensate loan customers will require material capital  injections from foreign parents to restore regulatory capital and lending  capacity, Fitch Ratings says. The law, passed on 4 July, requires lenders to repay borrowers for unilateral  interest rate changes to retail loan contracts that were made by banks passing  on some of their higher foreign-currency refinancing costs after the 2008  financial crisis. Lenders are also required to compensate customers for  exchange-rate spread charges on foreign-currency loans. The central bank's preliminary estimates of costs for the sector are  HUF600bn-900bn (EUR2bn-3bn), according to Reuters. The compensation payments  could wipe out around a third of the sector's equity at end-2013. But the impact  will vary significantly from bank to bank as a handful of lenders generate most  of the sector's profits and capital is tight in some large foreign-owned banks.  Individual lenders' portfolio mix will also influence the final costs. OTP <OTPB.BU> , Hungary's largest bank, estimated its compensation costs to be around  HUF147bn (in the worst-case scenario), with over 80% arising from the unilateral  interest-rate increases. This would lower the bank's 1Q14 Basel III common  equity Tier 1 ratio by a relatively small 1.7pp to 14.7%, reflecting OTP's  substantially stronger capital position compared with other Hungarian banks.  Profit warnings are likely from most of the largest Hungarian banks or from  their parent institutions. Austria's Erste Bank warned last week of higher loan  provisions in Hungary related to the new compensation. KBC said today that its  Hungarian subsidiary has sufficient capital to absorb the impact of the new  legislation, which the bank estimated at up to EUR232m (around HUF70bn). We will review the ratings of Hungarian banks once we have analysed the impact  of the new law on individual banks' credit profiles, and assessed the foreign  parents' readiness to offset losses with further capital injections, where  required. The VRs of Erste's subsidiary (b-) and Intesa's subsidiary, CIB (ccc),  are already very low, reflecting their weak asset quality and capitalisation.  K&H, the subsidiary of Belgium's KBC bank [KBCBK.UL] (bb-), has considerably larger  loss-absorption capacity. Further costs from the potential conversion of retail foreign-currency loans  into forints may be on the way, with the government set to make a decision this  autumn, in a separate step. Losses for banks could be substantial because of the  popularity of the products in the run-up to the crisis. The state may share some  of the costs of the conversion, but is unlikely to have much appetite for this  as the EU has just warned that the country may fall back under its strict budget  oversight.
