LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - Banks dampened a tentative rebound in European equity indexes on Tuesday as Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE> was said to be negotiating a settlement with U.S. authorities.

Shares in the German lender fell 3.5 percent as sources told Reuters U.S. authorities have begun settlement talks with the bank and larger competitor Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, down 0.5 percent, over their dealings with countries blacklisted by the United States.
