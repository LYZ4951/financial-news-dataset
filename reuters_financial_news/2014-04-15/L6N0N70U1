STOCKHOLM, April 15 (Reuters) - E-commerce group CDON <CDON.ST> is planning to launch pilot tests of an in-house payment solution over the coming months, the company said on Tuesday.

The pilot test, which has been evaluated and prepared for some time, includes invoice- and instalment payments for two of the group's Swedish sites, CDON said in a statement. According to Swedish business daily Dagens Industri's sources, CDON also plans to end its cooperation with payment solution company Klarna, a move which could save CDON over 100 million Swedish crowns ($15.24 million) over time.
