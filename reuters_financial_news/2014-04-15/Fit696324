April 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

With risk associated to U.S. fiscal challenges less  urgent, Latin America remains tested by slowing growth in China and its effect  on commodities demand, according to Fitch Ratings Latin America Risk radar. 'Growth across Latin America, while still rising has slowed, and the forecast  remains modest. With China's growth also slowing, a sustained reduction in  investment may place pressure on the demand for commodities, long an important  contributor to growth in many Latin American countries,' said Peter Shaw,  Regional Credit Officer for Latin America.  Credit growth continues at a somewhat slower, albeit double digit, growth rate  exposing banks to a potential slowdown.  Sustained credit growth has led to a significant increase in consumer  indebtedness, while corporate leverage has risen more modestly. A rise in risk aversion and volatility as the US Fed continues its tapering has  exacerbated the challenges issuers face in foreign funding and forex management.  Lower-rated borrowers may find access to international capital markets limited  while pricing pressure moves upwards. Increased access to credit in many of the region's markets has helped fuel a  rise in real estate prices over recent years, most notably in Brazil, but also  in Peru, Chile and Colombia.
