April 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings says that 1Q14 syndicated loan volumes to  European corporates fell to EUR107bn, their lowest level since 1Q12 and almost  one-third below the average since 1999, which is surprising in view of the  generally improving economic backdrop.  Total debt funding (bonds and loans) to the sector has fallen by almost a  quarter year on year according to data from Dealogic. While quarterly bond and  loan volumes fluctuate, this was the lowest amount of syndicated loans since  1Q12 when banks received support by the ECB's LTROs, says Fitch in a new  quarterly report.  The reduction in corporate funding is unexpected in view of the generally  improving economic environment. Nevertheless, Fitch believes it is more likely  to be demand than supply driven and may partially reflect subdued corporate  capex plans for 2014. Companies are focusing on reducing debt and conserving  cash in the face of slowing emerging-market growth and continuing political  turmoil in Russia and Ukraine. Many issuers have also significantly pre-funded  this year's debt maturities, taking advantage of favourable funding conditions  since mid-2013, resulting in relatively comfortable liquidity positions in the  near term. The lower loan volumes were regionally broad-based. In Germany, the UK and  France, which together accounted for half the total, companies borrowed 23% less  than in 1Q13. Russian corporate borrowing was down 80%. There was a mixed  picture in the eurozone periphery, with Spanish companies adding 19% but levels  in Italy down 91%. The drop in bank lending has driven further funding disintermediation, with  bonds accounting for a near all-time-high 54% of total new corporate debt  funding in 1Q14, almost double the 30% annual average since 1999.
