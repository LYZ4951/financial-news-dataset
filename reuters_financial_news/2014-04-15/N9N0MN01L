April 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering adopting more measures to address the remaining financial-stability risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Tuesday.

In a video speech, Yellen praised new liquidity standards for global banking firms, but warned that they do not apply to so-called shadow banks or to the financial system as a whole. The so-called Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) standards "do not fully address the financial stability concerns associated with short-term wholesale funding," she said via video to a financial markets conference at the Atlanta Fed. "Federal Reserve staff are actively considering additional measures that could address these and other residual risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets." She pointed to a study by the Basel Committee suggesting there would be net social gains from further reforms.
