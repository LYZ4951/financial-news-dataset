ATHENS, April 15 (Reuters) - Greece's bank bailout fund received bids from anchor investors, including Canada's Fairfax <FFH.TO> and York Capital, for a big chunk of Eurobank's <EURBr.AT> 2.86 billion euro share offering, a senior banking source close to the talks said on Tuesday.

"The bids from the cornerstone investors fall within the targeted 1.2 to 1.5 billion euros, targeted by the HFSF bailout fund," the banker told Reuters.
