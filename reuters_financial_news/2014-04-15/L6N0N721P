LISBON, April 15 (Reuters) - Portugal's rescued bank Banif <BANIF.LS> plans to raise 138.5 million euros ($191.35 million) through a public offering of shares, as part of its efforts to repay rescue loans to the state.

Banif, a small bank based in Madeira, said late on Monday the stock would be offered at 0.01 euros a share, below Monday's closing price of 0.0119 euros. The sale should be concluded by the end of May. Banif's shares dropped more than 7 percent to 0.011 euros early on Tuesday. The broader market in Lisbon <.PSI20> fell 1 percent.Portugal's 78 billion-euro EU/IMF bailout has a 12 billion- euro recapitalisation line for banks. About half of that has been used by Millennium BCP <BCP.LS>, Banco BPI <BBPI.LS> and the smaller Banif.  Banif still holds 125 million euros of state funds in so-called contingent convertible bonds, which have to be repaid by the end of the year. As part of the bank's rescue, the state has also taken a majority 59 percent voting stake in Banif. The capital increase should lower that to 49 percent. Banif CEO Jorge Tome also said the bank was in negotiations with the government of Equatorial Guinea to sell an 11 percent stake to a Guinean entity, possibly the country's sovereign fund or a state energy company. The stake would come out of the government's holding. Such a sale would be worth about the same as the capital increase. "If there is going to be a partnership, Banif will be in a privileged position serving as a link for Portuguese companies to Equatorial Guinea, whose economy is growing rather well... So that is the strategic goal," Tome said. "The negotiations are running well and with a lot of optimism."  A deal could be possible in the first half of the year, he said.
