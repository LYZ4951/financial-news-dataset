KIEV, April 15 (Reuters) - Ukraine's state security service has opened a criminal case against officials at an unnamed Russian bank for "providing financing to terrorists," the SBU said in a statement on Tuesday.

The SBU said the bank transferred 45 million hryvnia ($3.75 million) between March and April for the financing of militant groups and had transferred between $200 and $500 per day to individual militants.
