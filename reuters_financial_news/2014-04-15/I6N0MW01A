MILAN, April 15 (Reuters) - Short-selling on the shares of Banca Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI> has been temporarily banned, Italian market regulator Consob said after the stock fell more than 8 percent on expectations the bank could increase the size of a planned share issue.

Consob said on Tuesday the ban would last until the end of Wednesday's trading session.
