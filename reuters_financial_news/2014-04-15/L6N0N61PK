OSLO, April 15 (Reuters) - The sharp decline in Norwegian new home sales may be over after a rise in sales over the past two months, think tank Samfunnsoekonomisk Analyse (SA) said on Tuesday.

"The decline in the new home market seem to have stopped," chief economist Roger Bjoernstad said in the press release. "But it is too early to say if it has turned to recovery, as new home sales normally edge up at this time of year."  House prices began to fall in mid-2013 after 20 years of almost unbroken growth, hitting demand for new dwellings particularly hard. However, there have been signs of improvement both for new and existing homes in recent months. In the populous south east region, including Oslo, new home sales rose by 29 percent in the two months from mid-February to mid-April compared to the previous two months. Sales fell 37 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Some 1,635 new homes were sold nationwide over the two month period, nearly 400 more than in the previous two-month period. Year-on-year numbers were unavailable.
