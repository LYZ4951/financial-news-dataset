April 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed three pass-through certificates (PTCs) from two Indian asset-backed securitisation (ABS) transactions, namely Small Business Trust 2012 (SBT 2012) and Small  Business Trust 2013 (SBT 2013), at 'BBB-sf'. These transactions are backed by  small business loans originated by Shriram City Union Finance Limited <SHCU.NS> (SCUF),  which also acts as a servicer for the transactions.  The rating actions are listed at the end of this rating action commentary.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect satisfactory asset performance and sufficient credit  enhancement (CE) for the rated notes. For both transactions, CE has increased  since the closing date, driven by steady amortisation of the static portfolios.  Loan seasoning has increased to 35 months and 20 months for SBT 2012 and SBT  2013 respectively. Other portfolio characteristics including the weighted  average yield and geographical distribution have remained fairly stable since  the transactions closed. Maximum loans accounted for less than 0.2% of each  securitised portfolio in February 2014, reflecting minimal concentration at the  obligor level.  Driven by high origination standards, delinquency levels for both transactions  are zero and are deemed low relative to other rated securitisation transactions  in India, particularly those that have securitised commercial-vehicle loans. The  key difference is that loans securitised in SBT 2012 and SBT 2013 are used  primarily to finance working-capital requirements of relatively low-risk small  and medium enterprise (SME) borrowers who have a satisfactory payment record  within Shriram Group. SCUF has access to detailed obligor-specific information,  and it is able to tailor collateral levels to match individual risk profiles,  with higher-risk customers posting greater amounts of collateral. SCUF also does  not outsource its collection, but employs its own in-house teams to enhance  collection efficiency.  The portfolio of SBT 2012 has amortised by 84.9% of its initial balance. This  has raised the CE to 51.2% of the balance of the outstanding collateral balance  in March 2014, from 7.8% in January 2012 when the transaction closed. Loans that  were 90+ days past due (dpd) and 180+dpd as percentages of the initial pool  balance were at zero in February 2014. Since collateral value has remained  largely unchanged while loans continue to amortise, the weighted average current  loan-to-value (LTV) ratio has declined to 29.3%, from 85.5% at closing. Nearly  90% of the portfolio has an LTV of below 50%, suggesting sufficient security at  the loan level.  The portfolio of SBT 2013 has amortised by 65.7% of its initial balance. This  has raised the CE to 38.8% of the outstanding collateral balance in March 2014,  from 13.3% in April 2013 when the transaction closed. Loans that were 90+dpd and  180+dpd as percentages of the initial pool balance were at zero in February  2014. Like SBT 2012, the SBT 2013 transaction has seen its weighted average  current LTV drop to 42.2%, from 82.1% when the transaction closed.  For both transactions, the CE has not been utilised. The excess spread has been  sufficient to absorb losses incurred by the transactions. CE is in the form of  fixed deposits, which comprise a first-loss credit facility and a second-loss  credit facility, kept at Canara Bank <CNBK.NS> (BBB-/Stable/F3).   In 2014, delinquencies are generally expected to increase for rated asset-backed  securitisation (ABS) transactions in India. This is due to India's economic  slowdown, which is exacerbated by the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee,  rising petroleum prices, and political uncertainty amid ongoing national  elections. However, the impact from such stress on these two transactions is  likely to be limited compared to other rated transactions given the higher  quality of obligors and the different financing purpose served by the  securitised loans in SBT 2012 and SBT 2013. In addition, the notes can withstand  stresses well above base-case levels, and CE is likely to build up rapidly due  to the fast amortisation of the underlying portfolios. Together, they should  create sufficient buffers for the transactions against India's economic  uncertainties.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Based on Fitch's sensitivity analysis, the base-case default rate would need to  increase by at least 4.0x and 4.2x for SBT 2012 and 2013 respectively from the  closing base-case default rates, before a downgrade of the PTCs to 'BB+sf' is  considered. The rating-sensitivity analysis assumes that the CE and other  factors remain constant. Stresses on recovery rates in the sensitivity analysis  did not lead to a downgrade scenario.  The rating could be upgraded if the rating of the bank holding the cash  collateral is upgraded to above 'BBB-' and the portfolio performance remains  sound, with adequate CE that can withstand stress at above a 'BBB-sf' rating  scenario.
