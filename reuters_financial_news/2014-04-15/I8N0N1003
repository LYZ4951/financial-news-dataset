MUMBAI, April 15 (Reuters) - India's broader NSE index fell for a second consecutive session on Tuesday, provisionally marking its biggest fall since March 3, as interest-rate sensitive shares such as HDFC fell after wholesale inflation accelerated much more than expected.

The NSE index <.NSEI> provisionally fell 0.64 percent, potentially its biggest single day percentage fall since March 3. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> provisionally fell 0.64 percent.
