MILAN, April 15 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's may cut Veneto Banca's long-term 'BB' rating by one or two notches, the rating agency said on Tuesday, warning the Italian mid-sized bank could have difficulties meeting its capital strengthening and business targets.

S&P said it was placing the bank's ratings on review for a possible downgrade following the unveiling of its new 2014-2018 business plan and capital raising measures comprising a 500 million euros share sale and the conversion of a 350 million euro bond into equity. S&P said it would wait until after shareholders meeting on April 26 named a new board to assess "both the bank's management stability and its capacity to complete the actions announced."
