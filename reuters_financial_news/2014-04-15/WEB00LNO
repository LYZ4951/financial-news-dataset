PARIS, April 15 (Reuters) - Edenred <EDEN.PA>, the French vouchers and prepaid cards group, said on Tuesday that revenue fell 4.6 percent year-on-year in the first quarter as weaker exchange rates for emerging market currencies, notably in Latin America, weighed.

On a like-for-like basis, which excludes currency impacts, acquisitions and divestments, revenue rose 7.1 percent to 238 million euros ($329 million), driven by a strong performance in Latin America.
