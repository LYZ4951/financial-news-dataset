DUBLIN, April 15 (Reuters) - Irish debt could fall lower to trade at levels just above that of Belgium's, the head of the country's debt agency said, indicating that a turnaround in its bond market is showing no signs of slowing down.

Ireland sold 10-year bonds at a record low yield of 2.9 percent last week, compared to the 2.09 level Belgium currently trades, although John Corrigan said this showed how dislocated markets are at present as well as the progress Ireland had made.
