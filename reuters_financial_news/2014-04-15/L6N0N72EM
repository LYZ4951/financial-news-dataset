CAIRO, April 15 (Reuters) - Egyptian property developer SODIC <OCDI.CA> has agreed to pay the government 900 million Egyptian pounds ($129 million) over seven years following a revaluation of its Eastown scheme in Cairo, adding it would develop the project over five years.

Egypt's investment minister Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour said on April 6 that SODIC had revalued land bought from the state for the project and agreed to pay the difference over the sum it had initially paid.
