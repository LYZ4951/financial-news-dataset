SINGAPORE, April 15 (Reuters) - Shares of CapitaMalls Asia <CMAL.SI> surged as much as 22 percent after Southeast Asia's biggest property developer CapitaLand Ltd <CATL.SI> offered to buy out minority shareholders in the Singapore-listed shopping mall operator.

CapitaMalls shares hit as high as S$2.21, the highest in about 14 months. Nearly 99 million shares were traded, almost 10 times its average full-day volume over the past 30 days. CapitaLand shares jumped 5.1 percent. CapitaLand said on Monday it had offered S$2.22 per share for CapitaMalls, in which it already owns 65 percent. The S$3.06 billion ($2.45 billion) deal is aimed at simplifying CapitaLand's corporate structure and taking advantage of a discount valuation at CapitaMalls.
