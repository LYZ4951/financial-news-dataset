LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - British insurer RSA <RSA.L> has appointed its emerging markets chief to the new role of chief operating officer to oversee sales of non-core businesses as the company shores up a weakened balance sheet.

In a statement on Tuesday, RSA said Paul Whittaker, currently chief executive of emerging markets, will become COO from May 1. "This role reflects our new strategy and will provide essential co-ordination and focus for the successful delivery of the self-help measures underway to recapitalise the business," Group Chief Executive Stephen Hester said.
