HANOI, April 15 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> edged down 0.26 percent by mid-day on Tuesday due to profit-taking by foreign investors in some blue chips, an analyst said.

Bank shares led the fall, with Vietcombank <VCB.HM> losing 0.98 percent, Military Commercial Bank <MBB.HM> dropping 1.3 percent and Eximbank <EIB.HM> falling 0.72 percent. "Foreign investors have been selling blue chips after they hit good prices since last week and other investors remained cautious," said analyst Nguyen The Minh at Viet Capital Securities. Foreign investors have been net sellers in the past five trading sessions on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, Asia's best performing bourse so far this year. They have sold stocks worth of 595 billion dong ($28.2 million) since April 7. Minh expects the index to trade below 600 points this week.
