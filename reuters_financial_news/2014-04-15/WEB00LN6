FRANKFURT, April 15 (Reuters) - German industrial machinery and process engineering group GEA Group <G1AG.DE> will sell its heat exchangers division to investor Triton for more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion), two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Private equity investor Triton has therefore beat out a rival consortium made up of buyout group EQT and industrial services group Bilfinger <GBFG.DE>. [ID:nL5N0MW36V] GEA said the sale was progressing according to its internal planning, which had aimed for a deal by the summer, declining to provide further details. Triton and EQT declined to comment. The heat exchangers division, GEA's second-largest business by revenue but last year defined as non-core, makes equipment for a wide range of applications from air conditioning to cooling towers. Bloomberg had earlier reported that a sale to Triton was near.
