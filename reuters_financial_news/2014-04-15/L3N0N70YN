SINGAPORE, April 15 (Reuters) - Shares of CapitaMalls Asia <CMAL.SI> surged as much as 22 percent to its highest in more than a year on Tuesday after CapitaLand Ltd <CATL.SI> offered to buy out minority shareholders in the shopping mall operator.

CapitaMalls shares hit as high as S$2.21, just short of the offer of S$2.22 per share from CapitaLand - Southeast Asia's biggest property developer. The gain pushed up the benchmark Straits Time Index <.FTSTI> to its highest in nearly 7 months. Nearly 115 million CapitaMalls shares were traded, more than 11 times its average full-day volume over the past 30 days. CapitaLand shares jumped more than 5 percent. [ID:nL3N0N61CU] Maybank Kim Eng maintained its "Buy" rating on the CapitaMalls shares, with a target price of S$3.85. "If the privatization is successfully executed, it would be one of CapitaLand's most astute acquisitions, allowing it to leverage on CapitaMalls' retail expertise while keeping it as a key earnings driver," the brokerage said. The Straits Times Index rose 1 percent to 3.248 - highest since Sept. 20 and outperforming a flat Asian market <.MIAPJ0000PUS>. Among other gainers, shares of Hotel Properties Ltd <HPPS.SI> surged to a near 11-month high after a consortium that includes Singapore tycoon Ong Beng Seng and Wheelock Properties (Singapore) Ltd <WPSL.SI> offered to buy Hotel Properties for S$3.50 per share.
