STOCKHOLM, April 15 (Reuters) - Swedish home prices rose 1.1 percent in March from February and 9.2 percent from a year earlier, Price Company Valueguard's housing index (HOX) showed on Tuesday.

Prices for apartments rose 1.3 percent compared to the previous month and 12.8 percent compared to the same month last year. Prices for single home houses rose 1.0 percent during March and 7.3 percent during the year. The HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods. The aim is to provide as accurate a picture as possible of the actual underlying price trends. Swedish house prices have nearly tripled over the last 15 years and both the centre-right government and financial regulators are worried about high levels of household debt and the risk of a bubble in the housing market.
