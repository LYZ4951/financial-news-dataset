SYDNEY, April 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares look set to make slim gains on Wednesday morning after Wall Street managed a better session, though demand may be crimped by weaker metals prices and slower growth in China.

* Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> edged up 0.2 percent 5,386, a 2.2-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJP> close. Then benchmark rose 0.6 percent on Tuesday. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> rose 0.4 percent to 5,096.9 in early trade. * U.S. stocks ended a volatile session higher on Tuesday, driven by gains in such blue-chip names as Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson, though persistent weakness in momentum names limited the Nasdaq's advance. * Base metals fell on Tuesday, led by nickel, as investors sold risky assets on worries about demand in top consumer China and on concern about tensions in Ukraine. * Gold tumbled about 2 percent on Tuesday on heavy stop-loss orders placed by momentum traders as prices broke below the key 200-day moving average. * Challenger Ltd <CGF.AX> said total group assets and funds under management at 31 March 2014 was A$49.5 billion, an increase of 21 percent for the 12 months and 1 percent for the quarter. [ID:nWNBS00F7V] * BHP Billiton <BHP.AX> and Fortescue Metals Group <FMG.AX> report third quarter production on Wednesday. * China is expected to report its slowest growth in five years on Wednesday, a Reuters poll shows, with signs of waning strength in the first quarter of 2014 already prompting government action to steady the world's second-largest economy.
