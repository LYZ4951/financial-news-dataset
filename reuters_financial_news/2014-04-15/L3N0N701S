WELLINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - New Zealand's consumer prices rose less than expected in the first quarter, but domestic price pressures grew strongly, backing expectations of another central bank rate rise next week.

The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3 percent in the three months to March 31, to be 1.5 percent higher than a year ago, according to Statistics New Zealand on Wednesday. Analysts had forecast a quarterly rise of 0.5 percent and an annual rise of 1.7 percent, the same as forecast by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). ************************************************************ KEY POINTS: - Q1 inflation driven by higher housing costs, rise in tobacco and alcohol taxes, power prices, insurance costs, newly built houses. - Offset by cheaper travel and food.  - Non-tradables inflation, barometer of domestic prices, +1.1 pct, +3.0 pct on year ago, strongest in two-and-a-half years.  - Tradables -0.7 pct, -0.6 pct on year ago, reflecting strong NZ dollar. - Click on [ID:nW9N0M700O] for a table  COMMENTARY: NICK TUFFLEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ASB  "It was weaker than we and the Reserve Bank was expecting. "Most of the surprise was on the tradeables front where it does look like there's still quite a challenge for retailers to claw back margins, so prices of a number of imported goods remains pretty subdued despite the improving retail environment. "It's a pretty benign outcome from the Reserve Bank's point of view ... but it remains extremely likely that the Reserve Bank will raise rates next week. "We think Reserve Bank will follow up an April move in July, but because market pricing has a very high chance of a June hike as opposed to a July hike, there remains a risk (of a repricing)." - - - - BEN JARMAN, ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN: "If you look back over the last couple of years, kiwi CPI keeps coming in on the downside and for a large part it was because of the strength of the currency, which is still in play now. "But it's interesting because we've had quite a long sustained period of strong growth and it is still no really turning up in inflation. "We don't think this is enough to see the RBNZ not hike next week, but beyond that we don't think they'll go at every meeting and will take the odd pause." - - - -  MARKET REACTION:  - The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> fell to a session low of  $0.8592 from around $0.8636 before the data, before paring losses.
