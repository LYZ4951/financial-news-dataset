BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong suffered their biggest daily drop in 10 weeks, hit by profit-taking in automakers and sharp declines in banks following weak Chinese money supply data.

The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong, or H-shares, closed down 2.1 percent. That marked its biggest one-day percentage drop since Feb. 4. The main Hang Seng Index <.HSI> ended 1.6 percent lower at 22,671.26. China Citic Banking Corp <0998.HK> fell 6.5 percent and China Minsheng Banking Corp <1988.HK> lost 8.2 percent after Chinese central bank data showed the country's money supply grew at its weakest pace since 2001 and loan growth slowed in March. Auto shares retreated on profit-taking after gaining over the past few days on positive earnings data. The sector is also being affected by uncertainties over regulations that may curb demand. Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd shares <2238.HK> fell 4.2 percent, Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <2333.HK> dropped 5.2 percent and Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd <0489.HK> lost 2.5 percent.
