April 15 (Reuters) - ConMed Corp <CNMD.O>, a surgical device maker that has been fighting off activist investors, is exploring a sale and has contacted large medical device companies to gauge their buyout interest, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Utica, New York-based ConMed, which has a market capitalization of just over $1.1 billion, has been under pressure since late last year from activist investors who raised issue with the company's performance and corporate governance. In recent weeks, ConMed has asked its financial advisers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N> and Greenhill & Co Inc <GHL.N>, to approach larger orthopedic device makers regarding a potential sale of the company, the people said. The process is at an early stage and there is no guarantee that a buyer will emerge, cautioned the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. ConMed said in an emailed statement: "As a matter of policy, CONMED does not comment on rumors or speculation. CONMED's Board of Directors and management team remain focused on creating value for shareholders."
