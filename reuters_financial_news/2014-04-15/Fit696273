April 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed four German Driver class A and class B notes' ratings at 'AAAsf' and 'AAsf' respectively. The agency maintained its Stable Outlook on the notes. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this comment.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the transactions' strong performance, which is better  than the agency's base case assumption. Therefore, we have lowered our lifetime  default expectation to 1.55% from 1.80% for all four transactions.  The portfolios have amortised rapidly since the agency conducted its previous  full rating review in April 2013, standing between 12% and 21% of their balance  at closing.  With the continuous amortization of instalment loans, the fraction of balloon  loans in the collateral pool has increased to some 90%. This means that the  impact of a possible payment shortfall on balloon loans becomes more pronounced.  At the regular term of a contract, customers have the right to sell the car to  the car dealer at a price equal to the balloon or to refinance the loan with VW  Bank GmbH [VOWGE.UL]. If the dealer defaults and customers are unable to refinance, they  are at a higher risk of default. Fitch has taken into account the increased  balloon risk due to seasoning of the transactions. It considers the  transactions' credit protection sufficient to cover this risk.   All transactions have a similar structure where the amortisation switches to  pro-rata once the targeted overcollateralisation (OC) levels have been reached.  As of February 2014, OC levels for all deals are at their target of 11.0% and  7.0% for class A and class B respectively. Amortisation switches back to  sequential as soon as the assets have reduced below 10% of the initial balance  or in case losses exceed a certain trigger level. Fitch does not assume that  such a trigger level would be reached in a base-case scenario.  Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by OC and a non-amortising reserve fund.  Both, the class A and B notes (as well as the Schuldschein loan in the case of  Private Driver 2011-1) feature CE ratios well above those at closing, ranging  from 12.7% for the class B of Private Driver 2011-1 to 21.0% for class A of  Driver Eight and Private Driver 2010-1 Fixed.On May 13 2014, the German Federal Court of Justice is scheduled to commence a  hearing on the validity of handling fees (Bearbeitungsentgelt fur Privatkredite)  agreed upon in loan contracts with private customers. Several Higher Regional  Courts (Oberlandesgerichte) have held such fees invalid so far. Fitch analysed  risks from a potential set-off right with regard to such fees in the securitised  contracts.  Fitch notes that, as the portfolio amortises, the exposure to handling fees  increases in relative size and is currently at about 7% of outstanding  discounted portfolio balance. In case the court judges the handling fees to be  invalid, Fitch expects an increase in amounts borrowers are seeking to claim  back. The potential set-off risk arising for the transactions has been taken  into consideration. The available credit protection is adequate to weather a  substantial amount of the exposure being subject to set-off, in addition to the  other risks highlighted in this report. In any case, such risk would only  materialise if and when VW Bank defaults.  The agency has also analysed risks from a potential commingling of funds in an  insolvency of VW Bank GmbH. Fitch deems the current levels of CE to be adequate  to withstand such stress.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - A ruling by the German Federal Court of Justice confirming the invalidity of  bespoke handling fees would increase the risk that borrowers may exercise  set-off in case of a default of VW Bank GmbH. On the other hand, if borrowers  reclaim their fees from VW Bank GmbH before the latter could default, this would  reduce the exposure to such fees.  - As the notes amortise, the reserve fund supports overall CE. While this raises  the notes' loss-absorption capacity, it raises dependency on the account bank at  which the funds are held. Fitch tested the impact of a jump-to-default of the  respective account banks on the notes' rating and does not consider there being  an excessive reliance. - CE has increased significantly since closing for all transactions, making them  largely insensitive to stressed default and recovery assumptions. However, a  severe deterioration of asset performance could nevertheless negatively impact  the ratings. The transactions are securitisations of auto loans originated in Germany by  Volkswagen Bank GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen Financial Services  AG [VOWGF.UL]. The loans are either fully amortising or balloon loans granted to retail and  corporate borrowers for the financing of new, used and demonstration cars.
