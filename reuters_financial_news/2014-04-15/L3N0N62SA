April 15 (Reuters) - Troubled British pub company Punch Taverns Plc <PUB.L> said it breached a debt covenant related to Punch A, one of its two securitisation vehicles, in the quarter ended March 1.

The debt-laden company's shares were down 5.7 percent at 12.98 pence on the London Stock Exchange at 1154 GMT on Tuesday. Punch's debt structure is complex and split into two securitised vehicles. Punch A holds 1.45 billion pounds ($2.43 billion) of gross debt, while Punch B holds 884 million pounds. The pub company had said earlier this month that it will convene a meeting on April 29 to seek covenant waivers from noteholders of the two securitisation vehicles. (http://link.reuters.com/ren58v) The waivers are necessary to prevent a default in payment, which in the case of Punch A may be as early as May 15. Punch, like many pub owners, was hit hard by Britain's double-dip recession and is trying to reduce 2.3 billion pounds ($3.85 billion) of debt built up before the downturn.

Revenue fell 4 percent to 233.5 million pounds. [ID:nRSO8357Ea]
