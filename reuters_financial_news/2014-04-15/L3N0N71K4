BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - China shares fell sharply on Tuesday as the banking sector took a beating after data showed the country's money supply grew at its slowest pace in more than a decade.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended down 1.4 percent at 2,101.60 points. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 1.7 percent. The CSI300 banking subindex <.CSI300BI> fell 2.3 percent after statistics showed China's money supply grew at its weakest pace since 2001 and loan growth slowed in March. One bright spot was Universal Scientific Industrial Shanghai Ltd <601231.SS>, whose shares jumped by their daily trading limit, up 10 percent, after the electrical goods manufacturer announced plans to raise up to 2.06 billion yuan ($331 million) via a private placement of shares.
