SEOUL, April 15 (Reuters) - Seoul shares slipped after hitting an over three-month high on Tuesday, weighed down by profit-taking amid uncertain global economic and policy prospects.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> closed down 0.2 percent at 1,992.27 points after rising as high as 2,009.04, the strongest since Jan. 2. Institutional investors sold a net 312.7 billion won ($301 million) worth of KOSPI shares, the largest amount since Oct. 23. The won <KRW=> fell for a second day on robust dollar demand from foreign shareholders, who converted their dividend payments from South Korean companies.
