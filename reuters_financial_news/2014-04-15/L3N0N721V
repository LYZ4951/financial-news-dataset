HANOI, April 15 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stocks gained on Tuesday, led by the Singapore market which rose on news of a $2.45 billion share buying plan by the region's biggest property developer, while Vietnam retreated as investors cut their losses.

Shares of CapitaMalls Asia <CMAL.SI> surged 21.33 percent to a 14-month closing high after Southeast Asia's biggest property developer CapitaLand Ltd <CATL.SI> offered to buy out minority shareholders in the Singapore-listed shopping mall operator. [ID:nL3N0N70GX] The deal is aimed at simplifying CapitaLand's corporate structure and taking advantage of a discount valuation at CapitaMalls. CapitaLand shares also jumped 6.51 percent. The Straits Times Index <.FTSTI> climbed 0.98 percent to close at 3246.32, the highest since September last year. Shares in other markets also rose, with Indonesia <.JKSE> up 0.11 percent, Malaysia <.KLSE> rising 0.13 percent and the Philippine benchmark <.PSI> advancing 0.49 percent. However, the Vietnamese market tumbled due to wide-ranging offloading of equities as investors cut losses on expectations of further declines. The VN Index <.VNI> marked a fourth straight fall to close down 1.68 percent, near a two-week low. The Thai market was closed for a public holiday and will reopen on Wednesday.
