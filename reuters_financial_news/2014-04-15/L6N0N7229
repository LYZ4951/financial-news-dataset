LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - A consortium of eight anchor investors have committed to buy 25-30 percent of Euronext ahead of a market listing expected to value the company at 1-1.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion), three sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The consortium of anchor investors comprises BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, France's Caisse des Depots [CDCEC.UL], ING <ING.AS>, ABN Amro [ABRGPG.UL], Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS>, as well as Belgium's SFPI and Belfius. The listing is expected to take place in Paris in June.
