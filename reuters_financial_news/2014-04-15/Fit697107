April 15 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) and National Ratings of four foreign-owned banks in Indonesia - PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk <BNGA.JK> (CIMB Niaga), PT Bank Internasional Indonesia <BNII.JK> (BII), PT Bank OCBC NISP Tbk <NISP.JK> (OCBC NISP) and PT Bank UOB Indonesia (UOBI). A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary.  'AAA' Long-Term National Ratings denote the highest rating assigned by Fitch on  its national rating scale for that country. This rating is assigned to issuers  or obligations with the lowest expectation of default risk relative to all other  issuers or obligations in the same country. 'F1' Short-Term National Ratings indicate the strongest capacity for timely  payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or obligations in the  same country. On Fitch's National Rating scale, this rating is assigned to the  lowest default risk relative to others in the same country. Where the liquidity  profile is particularly strong, a "+" is added to the assigned rating. The affirmation of the IDRs and National Long-Term Ratings reflects strong  parental support and linkage for the four banks. The affirmation of Viability  Ratings (VRs) on CIMB Niaga, BII and OCBC NISP reflect the banks' moderate  franchises and broadly stable standalone credit profiles under increased  pressure arising from lower profitability for all these banks and, in case of  CIMB Niaga and BII, weaker asset quality. Fitch has also assigned a Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR of 'F3' to CIMB Niaga  and National Short-Term ratings of 'F1+(idn)' to CIMB Niaga, BII and UOBI.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, National Ratings & Support Ratings  The IDRs, Support Ratings and National ratings on the four banks reflect Fitch's  view that each bank's higher-rated foreign parent has a high propensity to  provide timely support to its subsidiary, if needed. The Long-Term Foreign  Currency IDRs are constrained by Indonesia's Country Ceiling of 'BBB', while the  Long-Term Local Currency IDRs are constrained by a three-notch uplift from  Indonesia's Long-Term Local Currency IDR. Fitch's view of support is reinforced  by the growing strategic importance of these Indonesian subsidiaries to the  parents' Asia franchises, the parents' majority ownership/control and a high  level of integration with their parents. CIMB Niaga is owned by Malaysia-based  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd <CIMB.KL> and BII is owned by Malayan Banking Berhard <MBBM.KL> (Maybank; A-/Negative). OCBC NISP and UOBI are majority owned by Singapore-based  Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC; AA-/Negative) and United Overseas Bank  Limited <UOBH.SI> (UOB; AA-/Stable), respectively.   KEY RATING DRIVERS - Viability Ratings CIMB Niaga's VR of 'bb' reflects its franchise as Indonesia's fifth-largest bank  by assets at end-2013 and its moderate asset quality, capital position,  profitability and funding profile. BII's VR of 'bb' reflects its modest  capitalisation and profitability, and its smaller franchise compared with CIMB  Niaga. However, this is counterbalanced by BII's slightly lower non-performing  loan ratio and better funding profile compared with CIMB Niaga. OCBC NISP's VR  of 'bb' takes into account its consistently strong asset quality and  satisfactory capital position, despite its smaller franchise, modest  profitability and weaker funding profile compared with CIMB Niaga and BII.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, National and Support Ratings  Upside potential for the banks' IDRs may result from an upgrade of the  Indonesian Country Ceiling, but only if the parents' ratings remain above  Indonesia's Country Ceiling. Support ratings are likely to remain unchanged  barring multiple notches of rating changes of their parents' IDRs. There is no  rating upside for the National Ratings as they are already at the top end of the  scale.  Downward rating pressure may arise from any developments leading to a weakening  of perceived support from their parents, such as major changes to ownership or a  significant weakening in their parents' financial ability, although Fitch  believes this to be a remote prospect in the near- to medium-term. Deterioration  in the banks' standalone financial profile is unlikely to impact their IDRs and  National Rating unless the factors underpinning the parent support also weaken.  OCBC's ratings are presently on Rating Watch Negative (RWN), reflecting OCBC's  planned acquisition of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank Limited <0302.HK> (see "Fitch Places  OCBC on Watch Negative on Wing Hang Bank Takeover Plan", dated 2 April 2014). In  Fitch's view, the RWN on OCBC's ratings is less likely to impact OCBC NISP's  ratings as OCBC's ratings are much higher than the current Indonesian Country  Ceiling.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - VRs  Rating upside on the banks' VRs may result if their franchises grow to be more  comparable to the major Indonesian banks', while they maintain healthy  risk-adjusted profitability, high core capitalisation, predominantly low-cost  deposit-funded balance sheets and sound asset quality record. Rating downside  may result from rapid loan growth adversely affecting asset quality and  capitalisation, and/or marked weakening in their liquidity profiles,  particularly if the economic environment were to deteriorate.   RATING SENSITIVITIES - Debt Ratings  The ratings of the companies' rupiah-denominated senior bonds and bond programme  are the same as their National Long-Term and Short-Term Ratings. This is because  these debts constitute direct, unsubordinated and senior unsecured obligations  of the concerned entities and rank equally with all their other unsecured and  unsubordinated obligations. Any changes in the National Long-Term and Short-Term  Ratings would affect these issue ratings.  The subordinated debts are rated two notches below the banks' National Long-Term  Rating, comprising one notch for loss severity and one notch for non-performance  risk (partially neutralised by parent support ) to reflect their subordination  status and coupon and/or principal deferral risk.
