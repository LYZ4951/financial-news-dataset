April 15 (Reuters) - Detroit and its two pension funds are close to a deal over the treatment of retirement benefits in the city's historic bankruptcy case, a top retirement system official said on Tuesday.

George Orzech, chairman of Detroit's Police and Fire Retirement System, said a final deal that would increase the assumed investment rate of return for the funds and decrease the percentage of pension cuts proposed by the city could be reached as soon as Tuesday.
