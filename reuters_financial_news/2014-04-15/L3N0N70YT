BEIJING, April 15 (Reuters) - China shares fell on Tuesday as weak banking stocks weighed on sentiment after data showed the country's money supply grew at its slowest pace in more than a decade and loan growth slowed.

Hong Kong stocks also fell, dragged lower by auto shares, which shed some of the gains seen over the past few days after positive earnings data. The sector is also being affected by  uncertainties over regulations that may curb demand. By the midday break, the CSI300 <.CSI300> index of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was down 1.0 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> eased 0.8 percent to 2,114.6 points.  The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was down 1.1 percent at 22,788.68 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong dropped 1.4 percent.  Banking shares led the decline on the mainland, with the CSI300 banking sub-index <.CSI300BI> falling 1.6 percent after China's money supply grew at its weakest pace in more than a decade in March. Analysts said a depreciation in the yuan appeared to have slowed capital inflows and the build-up of foreign exchange reserves.  Total outstanding loans in March also slowed to an eight-year low of 13.9 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed, an indication that the de-leveraging process in financial institutions continues, analysts said. [ID:L3N0N70G1] Hua Xia Bank Co Ltd <600015.SS> was down 2.3 percent, while  Industrial Bank Co Ltd <601166.SS> lost 2.2 percent and China Citic Bank Corp Ltd <601998.SS> shed 1.8 percent.  The encroachment of online financial management products and their impact on interbank lending rates is also worrying investors, said Tian Weidong, head of research in Kaiyuan Securities in the city of Xi'an.  "There are several new products with much higher interest rates on savings and people predict that banking results will go down in the future because of this." In Hong Kong, auto stocks were a major drag on index performance after investors decided to lock in gains following positive earnings results over the last month, as future growth prospects for the industry remain unclear.  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd shares <2238.HK> lost 3.4 percent, Great Wall Motor Co Ltd <2333.HK> was down 4.2 percent, and Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd <0489.HK> lost 1.9 percent.  "Overall, the fundamentals are not that stable, so I think if there is some retrenchment it's normal," said Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. Investors are chiefly concerned that vehicle purchasing limits, currently in place in four cities, may be further rolled out across the country as part of government efforts to tackle pollution.
