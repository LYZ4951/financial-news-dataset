LAGOS, April 15 (Reuters) - Nigerian lender Skye Bank <SKYEBAN.LG> aims to target retail and business customers this year to expand loans by 15 percent, up from 2 percent growth last year, incoming chief executive Timothy Oguntayo said on Tuesday.

"Liquidity was a major constraint to growth in risk assets in 2013," Oguntayo said on an analyst conference call, adding that the mid-tier lender was looking to balance its deposits mix.
