BEIJING, April 21 (Reuters) - Nineteen firms, including the cinema arm of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda, have announced plans for stock market listings, countering a trend among dozens of others that have axed their stock debuts due to regulatory hurdles.

Draft prospectuses for the initial public offers (IPOs) were released on the website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Monday, and follow listing plans unveiled by 28 other firms over the weekend. The spike in IPO hopefuls comes as China faces an eight-week long dry spell for new listings, which bankers and companies say is a result of constantly changing listing requirements revised 16 times in the last six months. The confusion caused more than 24 companies to abandon their listing plans this year, according to the stock regulator. [ID:nL3N0N2283] It is not clear from the draft prospectuses when or whether the firms will list, or how much cash they would raise if they do. China had ended a 14-month IPO drought by allowing around 50 firms to list in January and February, raising expectations that this year could produce a record for new issuance worth as much as $40 billion.
