HANOI, April 21 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed down 1.27 percent on Monday at its lowest level in nearly 10 weeks as investors cut loss after the index fell during the past two weeks, analysts said.

The index ended at 558.14 points, the lowest since Feb. 11, when it stood at 553.90. Real estate shares led the fall, with Vingroup <VIC.HM> dropping 0.77 percent and HAGL <HAG.HM> sliding 3.04 percent to 26,300 dong ($1.25), its lowest closing price in more than five weeks. PetroVietnam Gas <GAS.HM>, Vietnam's biggest listed firm, lost 1.1 percent and technology company FPT Corp <FPT.HM> fell 3.7 percent. "The market falling deeply since early this month made some investors worried on further declines," said analyst Hoang Huy at ACB Securities. "Therefore, after a small gain in this morning session, investors started cutting loss by selling some blue chips."  Here is a snapshot of the VN Index <.VNI> at the close (0801 GMT.)
