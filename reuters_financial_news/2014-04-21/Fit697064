April 21 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)

Prepayment rates among U.S. RMBS loans have declined to the lowest levels of the post-crisis era, according to Fitch Ratings in its latest quarterly index. The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) for prime jumbo, Alt-A and subprime loans  fell to 14.7%, 10.3% and 8.8%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2014. Prime  CPR is at the lowest level since early 2009, while Alt-A and subprime CPR are at  or near all-time lows. Higher interest rates and fewer distressed liquidations  are contributing to the slower prepayments, according to Director Sean Nelson.  'Mortgage rates are up roughly 100 basis points from their historic lows in late  2012,' said Nelson. 'Borrowers not taking advantage of historically low rates  may be unable to refinance their mortgages due to credit issues or lack of  equity.' CPR is comprised of both voluntary and involuntary prepayments. Voluntary  prepays have traditionally made up roughly 90% of the all-in CPR figure.  However, since the crash of the housing market, involuntary prepays  (liquidations of distressed loans) have made up an increasing share. Since 2009,  the majority of non-prime CPR has been involuntary liquidations. Only about a  third of Alt-A and a fifth of subprime CPR has been voluntary.  'Both voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates are likely to decline further  if mortgage rates continue to rise and liquidation rates continue to fall as  expected,' said Nelson. Fitch's index is published quarterly and highlights performance trends in legacy  and new issue RMBS, house price conditions and mortgage market developments.  Fitch's CPR index measures the annualized unscheduled prepayment rate among U.S.  private label, securitized mortgage loans.
