April 21 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Monday:

** Nokia <NOK1V.HE> said on Monday that it expected the sale of its handset business to Microsoft <MSFT.O> to be finalized on April 25, as it had received all the required regulatory approvals. The closure of the 5.4 billion euro ($7.5 billion) deal, which was agreed in September, had been delayed due to pending approvals, but earlier this month the companies won a crucial nod from Chinese regulators. [ID:nL6N0ND1ZC]  ** Goldcorp Inc <G.TO> said on Monday that it was walking away from its hostile bid to buy Osisko Mining Corp <OSK.TO>, clearing the way for Yamana Gold Inc <YRI.TO> and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd <AEM.TO> to take control of Osisko's flagship Canadian Malartic mine. The white-knight bid, which the companies valued at C$3.9 billion ($3.5 billion) when it was announced last week, would see Yamana and Agnico take joint control of most Osisko assets, and spin out some exploration properties into a new entity. [ID:nL2N0ND0QU]  ** The talks between Barrick Gold Corp <ABX.TO> and Newmont Mining Corp <NEM.N> over a combination that would create a gold mining behemoth have hit a snag, but two sources close to the situation say the companies remain keen on a deal and discussions are likely to resume. [ID:nL2N0ND00V]  ** Pfizer <PFE.N> may come back to bid for British drug company AstraZeneca <AZN.L> after its reported 60 billion pound ($100.85 billion) takeover approach was rejected, since a deal could make sense for the U.S. pharmaceuticals giant as it seeks to build up its cancer franchise. [ID:nL6N0ND1BM]  ** India's Hero Motor Corp Ltd <HROM.NS>, the maker of the Hero motorcycle, signed an agreement with Bangladesh automobile company Nitol Niloy Group to open a new manufacturing plant in Bangladesh in its first overseas joint venture. Hero will invest $40 million in the new plant. [ID:nL3N0ND28M]  ** China's online game developer Perfect World Co Ltd <PWRD.O> said it joined the consortium offering to buy rival Shanda Games Ltd <GAME.O>. Perfect World said it would buy 30.3 million class A Shanda Games shares for $100 million from Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd, a shareholder in and part of the consortium to buy Shanda Games. [ID:nL3N0ND20M]  ** Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd <600196.SS> has raised its offer for U.S.-listed Chindex International Inc <CHDX.O> by 15 percent to $223.6 million, topping an offer from an unidentified bidder for the China-focused hospital chain. [ID:nL3N0ND1JG]  ** Vietnam's Maritime Bank said on Monday that it planned to merge with Mekong Development Bank to boost the pair's financial strength and increase competitiveness. [ID:nL3N0ND1DU]  ** Square Inc has been in talks with several rivals for a possible sale as the mobile payments startup looks to stem widening losses and dwindling cash, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. [ID:nL3N0ND0YJ]  ** India's Larsen & Toubro Ltd <LART.NS> said on Monday that its unit had called off talks with Future Generali Insurance, a joint venture between local retail chain operator Future Group and Italy's Generali <GASI.MI>, to merge their businesses. After the deal, L&T was expected to hold a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, with Generali holding 26 percent and the rest with Future Group. [ID:nL3N0ND2NA]
