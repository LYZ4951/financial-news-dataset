HONG KONG, April 21 (Reuters) - A former Soros Fund Management team will start a Hong Kong-based hedge fund in the third quarter of 2014 with at least $150 million in initial capital including seed capital from HS Group, making it one of the biggest start-ups in the region this year.

Co-founded by Kenneth Lee and Michael Yoshino, the long/short equity hedge fund firm, Pleiad Investment Advisors, will focus on investments in China and Japan. Hedge fund start-ups in Asia on average raised just over $50 million each last year, according to data from industry tracker AsiaHedge, although the biggest of 2013, Asia Research & Capital Management, raised $1.1 billion. Most of Pleiad's capital will come from HS Group, a firm founded last year by Michael Garrow, an ex-Blackstone Group <BX.N> executive, and Johannes Kaps, who earlier worked at Goldman Sachs <GS.N>. The investment represents HS Group's first seed capital investment and one of the biggest ever seed capital investments in a hedge fund in Asia, where a typical seed investment is usually around $25 million. Seeders usually pocket 20-30 cents of every dollar earned by a hedge fund in addition to their share of the return generated. Many smaller managers and those looking to start in Asia are willing to share revenues in exchange for long-term capital. HS Group's backers include Swiss fund-of-hedge-funds manager Gottex Fund Management Holdings <GFMN.S> and V-Nee Yeh, co-founder of Hong Kong-based money manager Value Partners.
