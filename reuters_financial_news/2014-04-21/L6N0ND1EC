DUBAI, April 21 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank <ADIB.AD>, the largest sharia-compliant lender in the emirate, met analysts' expectations as it posted a 19.3 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on Monday.

The lender, which said earlier this month it was buying much of Barclays' retail operations in the United Arab Emirates, made a net profit of 409.5 million dirhams ($111.5 million) in the three months to March 31. That was up from 340.1 million dirhams in the prior-year period, it said in a bourse statement.
