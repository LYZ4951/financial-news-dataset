April 21 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc <C.N> is seeking buyers for about 50 branches holding $3 billion of deposits in California as the lender looks to trim its branch network, Bloomberg reported, citing three people involved in the process.

The branches, located in rural areas from Sacramento to north of Los Angeles, could sell for more than $100 million, Bloomberg reported.
