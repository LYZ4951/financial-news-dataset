MEXICO CITY, April 21 (Reuters) - Mexican homebuilder Geo said on Monday that it entered bankruptcy protection after a judge accepted its filing for restructuring.

The company, which said last month that it gained the support of the majority of its creditors in a so-called pre-packaged bankruptcy plan, will seek to replace most of its about $1 billion in debt with stock. [ID:nL2N0MI009]
