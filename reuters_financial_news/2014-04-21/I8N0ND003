MUMBAI, April 21 (Reuters) - Indian shares hit record highs on Monday as lenders such as Axis Bank rallied ahead of their financial results starting later this week, while strong gains in debt markets reduced concerns about potential losses in the sector's bond portfolios.

Sentiment also got a boost after India's top court allowed resumption of mining in the state of Goa, sending shares in miners such as Sesa Sterlite Ltd <SESA.NS> surging.
