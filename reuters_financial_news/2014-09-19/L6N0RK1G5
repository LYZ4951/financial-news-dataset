LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Scotland-based fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management <ADN.L> said he did not expect potential constitutional changes following the Scottish independence vote to materially impact the company.

Martin Gilbert told Reuters on Friday he and the company would remain neutral on the debate around so-called 'devolution max', adding the issue of what powers were ceded to Edinburgh was "now firmly in the Westminster politicians' hands". "It's now up to Westminster to deliver, but we'll be neutral on that and I don't expect it will have any more impact on our businesses than the vote did. So no repercussions on us, I think."
