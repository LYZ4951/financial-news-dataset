ZURICH, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Switzerland's financial regulator said on Friday it had initiated bankruptcy proceedings against a Swiss private bank that is part of the Espirito Santo family's troubled business empire.

FINMA said in a statement that it had found Banque Privee Espirito Santo SA (BPES), which has been in voluntary liquidation since July, to be over-indebted. The regulator said the bank is in a position to rapidly and fully reimburse privileged deposits to its clients, according to current estimates.
