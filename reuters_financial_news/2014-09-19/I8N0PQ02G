MUMBAI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose for a third consecutive session on Friday, hitting its highest in about 1-1/2 weeks, as cash-rich exporters such as Tata Consultancy Services <TCS.NS> surged on hopes of being better placed to weather any Fed-related volatility.

The 50-share index <.NSEI> tentatively rose 0.2 percent for the week, its sixth consecutive weekly gain. That was its longest winning run since a more powerful seven-week run between January and end-February 2012. Tata Consultancy Services provisionally rose 2.2 percent while Lupin <LUPN.NS> ended higher 1.8 percent.
