LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> hit a 6-1/2-year high on Friday after Scotland's vote against independence and Spanish shares outperformed as concerns about the Catalan separatist movement eased.

However, major share indexes traded off their intra-day highs as mounting expectations of an imminent credit downgrade of France affected French stocks and investors took profits on the last trading day of the week, traders said. France's CAC 40 <.FCHI>, up just 0.1 percent, underperformed the FTSEurofirst, which rose 0.4 percent to 1,403.08 points by 1423 GMT after climbing up to 1,410.93, its highest since 2008. Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> rose 0.5 percent, while Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> gained 0.3 percent. Broadly, the market rose after Scotland spurned independence in a referendum that would have split the United Kingdom, potentially triggering financial turmoil. Scottish referendum results: [ID:nL6N0RK02D] http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/scotland/index.html "It's a relief rally as the market was vieweing the referendum as a bump in the road. Now it is done and dusted and we turn our attention to fundamentals," Commerzbank equity strategist, Peter Dixon, said. Spain's IBEX <.IBEX> rose 0.5 percent as markets viewed Scotland's "No" vote as having reduced prospects of a stronger push for Catalonia breaking away. [ID:nL6N0RK0UJ] "The result is also a tonic to financial markets in Europe - where politicians in Spain in particular will be relieved that Catalonian secessionist fires have not been further stoked," Investec Wealth & Investment head of equities, Guy Ellison, said. The northern Spanish region of Catalonia, accounting for a fifth of Spanish economic output, is a wealthy region with its own language and culture. Its long-standing independence movement has grown over the last decade, fuelled by the economic crisis and a refusal by Madrid to meet regional demands. Despite the outcome in Scotland that was widely seen as a setback for the cause of Catalan independence, the region's separatist-led government was expected to announce plans later on Friday for a non-binding referendum, in defiance of Madrid. [ID:nL6N0RK1S8] Some fund managers remained cautious. "There will be a continued pressure from Catalonia to take control away from Madrid and this will build over the medium term, possibly to its own referendum if the Spanish Government  allows one," B Capital Wealth Management managing director, Lorne Baring, said. Among standout gainers, UK lender Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> rose 2.8 percent on relief following the Scottish vote. "For the markets in general, the Scottish result is probably the best outcome because the 'Yes' vote winning was really not priced in and that could have caused chaos, with contagion to Europe," Clairinvest fund manager, Ion-Marc Valahu, said. On the down side, Germany's SAP <SAPG.DE> fell 4.0 percent, making it the top loser in the FTSEurofirst 300, on concerns over a price tag of $7.3 billion in cash it would pay to buy U.S. expenses software maker Concur <CNQR.O>.
