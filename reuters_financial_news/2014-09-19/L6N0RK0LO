STOCKHOLM, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Swedish investment firm Investor AB <INVEb.ST> said on Friday it had agreed to buy additional shares in Finnish power plant and ship engine maker Wartsila <WRT1V.HE> to become its biggest owner.

Through the deal, Investor's stake in Wartsila will rise to 16.8 percent from 8.8 percent currently, while Finnish kitchen utensils and tools group Fiskars' <FIS1V.HE> stake in the group will decrease to 5.0 percent from 13.0 percent.

The joint venture will be dissolved following the deal, Investor said. "We look forward to developing the company further as a long-term owner", Investor Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said in a statement.
