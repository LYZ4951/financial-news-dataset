SOCHI, Russia, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Russia's investment climate will not improve unless there are changes in the country's leadership and political will for such an improvement, former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Friday.

Kudrin, who was forced to resign from his post in 2011 after protesting against increased defence spending, played a key role in restoring the country's finances in the 2000s after the chaotic leadership of late Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
