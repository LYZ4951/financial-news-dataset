NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A top New York Stock Exchange executive said on CNBC on Friday that the so-called "green shoe" option will be exercised for underwriters to buy additional shares in the Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. <BABA.N> initial public offering.

If exercised as indicated by Scott Cutler, the NYSE's head of global listings, in an interview on CNBC, that means an additional 48 million shares will be sold in the deal on top of the 320 million that priced at $68 each on Thursday.
