Standing in front of his office in central London, Cameron said the result paved the way for a new balanced constitutional settlement for all of Britain, including England, and that draft laws granting Scotland new powers would be published by January. "The debate has been settled for a generation ... there can be no disputes, no re-runs, we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people," Cameron told reporters. "Just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish parliament on their issues of tax, spending and welfare, so too England, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issues.
