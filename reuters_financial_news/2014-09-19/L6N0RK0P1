LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group <LLOY.L> said it would keep a "significant presence" in Scotland and was focused on supporting lending to home buyers and companies there after the country voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. [ID:nL6N0RK02D]

Edinburgh-based Lloyds was one of five lenders that said last week it would move headquarters or operations to England if Scots had voted for independence. It said on Friday it had maintained a neutral stance in the debate as it was a matter for the people of Scotland.
