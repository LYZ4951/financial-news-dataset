LONDON/EDINBURGH, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Scottish voters have rejected independence from the rest of the  United Kingdom in a vote that had threatened to break up the world's sixth-biggest economy.

Below are comments from politicians, business leaders and analysts to the result of the referendum.  UK PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON "I've just spoken to Alex Salmond, congratulating him on a hard-fought campaign. I'm delighted the SNP will join talks on further devolution." "Now it is time for our United Kingdom to come together and move forward." "The debate has been settled for a generation ... there can be no disputes, no re-runs. We have heard the settled will of the Scottish people."  SCOTLAND'S FIRST MINISTER AND NATIONALIST LEADER ALEX SALMOND "Scotland has by a majority decided not, at this stage, to become an independent country. I accept that verdict of the people and I call on all of Scotland to follow suit in accepting the democratic verdict of the people of Scotland."  On the promises by Britain's main political parties to devolve more powers to Scotland: "Scotland will expect these to be honoured in rapid course."  ALISTAIR DARLING, LEADER OF THE ANTI-INDEPENDENCE CAMPAIGN AND FORMER FINANCE MINISTER  "We have chosen unity over division, and positive change rather than needless separation." "Every political party must now listen to (the public's) cry for change which could be echoed in every part of our United Kingdom but had the opportunity to express itself first in Scotland."  JOHN LONGWORTH, HEAD OF BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE"The companies I speak to are clear that this cannot simply be the first in a series of referenda, until one side or the other gets the result that it wants. Business and investment prospects across the UK would be deeply hurt by a Quebec-style 'neverendum' - a lesson that politicians must heed."MICHAEL SAUNDERS, ECONOMIST WITH CITIGROUP
