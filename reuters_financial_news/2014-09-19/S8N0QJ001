LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's said the rejection of independence by voters in Scotland had no impact on its AAA rating for the United Kingdom, nor its stable outlook for the rating.

S&P is the only one of the three main international ratings agencies to have kept the UK at AAA.
