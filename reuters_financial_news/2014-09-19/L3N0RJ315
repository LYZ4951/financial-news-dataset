HONG KONG, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Shares in China's largest auto rental company CAR Inc <0699.HK> are set to rise 18 percent in their Hong Kong trading debut on Friday as investors who missed the initial public offering scramble for a piece of the deal.

The shares are indicated to open at HK$10, compared with their IPO price of HK$8.50, while the benchmark Hang Seng index <.HSI> was indicated to open up 0.7 percent. CAR Inc, which is backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] and Hertz Global Holdings Inc <HTZ.N>, raised $467 million after pricing the deal at the top of a HK$7.50 to HK$8.50 per share marketing range. It was the biggest IPO in Hong Kong since the world's largest pork producer WH Group Ltd. <0288.HK> raised $2.36 billion in late July.
