JAKARTA, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank deputy governor said on Friday that a rupiah level of between 11,600 to 11,900 against the dollar is good to support exports.

Bank Indonesia senior deputy governor Mirza Adityaswara also said that trading level is undervalued compared to Indonesia's fundamentals. "Bank Indonesia will always be in the (foreign exchange) market because our market is not deep enough," he told reporters.
