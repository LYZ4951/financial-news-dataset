PARIS, Sept 19 (Reuters) - European shares trimmed their gains in afternoon trade on Friday, with traders citing mounting expectation of an imminent credit downgrade of France that pulled the Paris blue-chip index into negative territory.

At 1216 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was up 0.3 percent at 1,402.27 points, after gaining nearly 1 percent in a relief rally after Scotland spurned independence in a referendum. France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> was down 0.2 percent. "There is talk of a downgrade that could come tonight," said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG France. "Traders are tempted to book profits ahead of the weekend." Spain's IBEX <.IBEX> trimmed gains, but was still up 0.1 percent, after the president of the north-eastern Spanish region of Catalonia, Artur Mas, said he would sign a decree law to call a Nov. 9 vote on independence from Spain.
