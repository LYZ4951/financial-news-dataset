HONG KONG, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index rose on Friday following gains on U.S. exchanges, but trimmed earlier gains as a weaker Chinese market weighed on sentiment.

By midday, the Hang Seng Index <.HSI> was up 0.4 percent at 24,254.95 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 0.3 percent. Both appeared headed for their second straight weekly loss, down 1.4 and 2.2 percent, respectively. The CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings inched 0.1 percent higher, while the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> was off 0.1 percent at 2,313.56 points. They are down 1.2 and 0.8 percent on the week.  "The Hong Kong market is just moving relatively sideways under a consolidation mood," said Ben Kwong, director at KGI Asia. More volatility can be expected with the quarter-end approaching, which would also come from investors' speculations about China's Central Committee meeting and the Hong Kong-Shanghai trading link in October, Kwong added. HSBC Holdings <0005.HK> was the biggest contributor to the Hang Seng with a rise of 1.8 percent, after early results from the Scottish independence vote reinforced expectations Scotland would remain in the United Kingdom. [ID:nL6N0RK02D] Standard Chartered <2888.HK> added 1.2 percent, while Hutchison Whampoa <0013.HK>, which has a big British exposure, advanced 0.4 percent. Chinese pharmaceutical companies posted solid gains, as people turn to defensive stocks while awaiting direction. Shanghai Pharmaceuticals <601607.SS> climbed 3.1 percent in Shanghai and Sinopharm Group <1099.HK> leapt 3.3 percent in Hong Kong.  CAR Inc <0699.HK> soared 28 percent in its Hong Kong trading debut as investors who missed the initial public offering scrambled for shares. It finished the morning session at HK$10.90 versus the IPO price of HK$8.50. [ID:nL3N0RJ315] Energy firms dragged. CNOOC <0883.HK> shed 1.1 percent and PetroChina <0857.HK> 1.0 percent.  Prada SpA <1913.HK> sank 2.8 percent to its lowest since July 2012 after UBS cut its share target price. The company's six-month results are due later in the day.
