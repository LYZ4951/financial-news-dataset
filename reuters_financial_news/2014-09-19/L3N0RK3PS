COLOMBO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan stocks rose for the fourth straight session on Friday to touch its highest in more than three years. The gains were led by banking and diversified shares on bullish sentiment due to lower interest rates, higher foreign fund buying and positive economic outlook.

Stockbrokers said they expected the index to gain further as the market is expecting another rate cut during the central bank's monetary policy rate meeting next week. The announcement is scheduled for 0200 GMT on Tuesday.  The main stock index <.CSE> ended up 0.39 percent, or 28.02 points, at 7,234.92, its highest closing level since June 9, 2011. "The market is continuing its bull run on the back of lower interest rates and positive outlook," said a stockbroker asking not to be named. "The market is expecting a rate cut because the treasury bill rates are now below the policy rates."  Yields on treasury bills fell 3-4 basis points at a weekly auction on Wednesday and are below the central bank's standing deposit facility rate or the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks. The cut in energy prices on Tuesday has also enthused the market.
