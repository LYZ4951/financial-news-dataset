NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's <BABA.N> record public offering of shares on Friday further spurred already elevated activity in Yahoo Inc's <YHOO.O> options, pushing volume on the U.S. Internet company to a one-day record high.

[ID:nL1N0RK0U9]  Investors eager for a bite of the Chinese e-commerce giant had turned their attention to Yahoo options in recent days, sending options volume in Yahoo steadily higher over the last month. Yahoo sold some $8 billion worth of shares in the offering, but it still has a 16.3 percent stake in the company.  Options trading in Yahoo spiked to 5.4 times normal, with a record 1.83 million contracts traded, nearly 35 percent higher than the previous one-day record set in 2008, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert data. About 1.26 million calls and 568,000 puts traded on Friday. The calls leading puts is consistent with the run-up into the Alibaba IPO over the past two weeks, Henry Schwartz, president at Trade Alert said. The 30-day implied volatility in Yahoo's options was down about 18.1 percent at 41.56 percent on Friday, according to data from options analytics firm Livevol Inc.
