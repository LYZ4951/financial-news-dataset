DETROIT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The Detroit City Council on Friday approved a deal with bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc that will end its objection to the city's plan to adjust its debt and exit the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy.    The complex deal between the city and its once fiercest hold-out creditor Syncora, which has a $400 million exposure in the case, was unveiled last week. The settlement comes in two parts: a financial resolution to the company's objection to the plan and a development agreement.
