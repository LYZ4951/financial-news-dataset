SEOUL, Sept 19 (Reuters) - South Korean shares rose on Friday, led by a rally in brokerages and encouraged by overnight gains which sent U.S. stock markets to  record highs.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) <.KS11> climbed 0.3 percent to close at 2,053.92 points. The KRX Securities sub-index <.KRXSEC> gained 2.0 percent, logging the best daily performance by sector on the main bourse. The South Korean won <KRW=> was a shade lower, as expectations of an early U.S interest rate hike sent the dollar soaring against a range of global currencies, although the won found some support from exporters who sold the greenback to fund domestic transactions.
