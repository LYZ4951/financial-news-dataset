LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management <ADN.L> said UK investors would "welcome a reduction in the uncertainty of recent months" after the country voted to reject independence.

Gilbert, who had looked to tread a neutral path during the referendum, said both sides now needed to come together and move forward united, adding that regardless of the outcome, Scotland could look forward to a "prosperous future".
