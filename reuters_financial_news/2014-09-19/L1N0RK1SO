SAO PAULO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Brazil's largest bank workers' union said on Friday that it was mulling a strike after a pay rise counter-proposal made by a group representing commercial banks was short of its demands.

In a statement, the Sindicato dos Bancários de São Paulo, Osasco e Região said a proposal made by Fenaban that offers a 0.61 percent inflation-adjusted gain "comes below the 1.54 percent average real pay rise negotiated in other sectors during the first half." The union wants a 5.4 percent inflation-adjusted wage increase, the implementation of a 14th monthly wage and a rise in the value of food vouchers in a list of eight proposals that was submitted to banks last month. Union leaders plan to meet in Sao Paulo next Thursday to decide whether to vote for a strike if Fenaban refuses to improve its proposal, the statement added.  A national strike by bank workers could begin on Sept. 30 and last indefinitely, the statement added. Over the past decade, the union has obtained an 18 percent inflation-adjusted gain for bank workers in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, with banks extending the pay rise to all their staff across Brazil.
