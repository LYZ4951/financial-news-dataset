NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch summarily fired two veteran brokers from its elite Private Banking and Investment Group two weeks ago for guiding clients to invest in a hedge fund outside of the brokerage firm.

The brokers, Stephen S. Brown and James P. Goetz, were based in Pittsford, New York - a suburb of Rochester - and managed about $2.5 billion of assets for clients, according to a source familiar with their practice. They were fired on Tuesday, Sept. 9, along with two client associates. Other members of their team remain, said sources in the large office of about 40 individual brokers and teams. Selling investments or other products not vetted and processed by an adviser's employer is known as "selling away" and is a violation of securities industry rules. The act is considered so unusual that all advisers in the Pittsford branch were, within 24 hours of the departures, summoned to a meeting at which the seriousness of the charges were explained, several said.  Some financial advisers occasionally direct clients to outside providers to buy insurance or other products that offer a deal they consider superior to what their firms have available. That usually violates internal policies, but the quick dismissals of Brown and Goetz likely indicates they committed the more serious act of receiving payments from the outside hedge fund, some sources said. Brown and Goetz, who had been with Merrill since 1991 and 1998, respectively, according to regulatory records, could not be reached for comment. They continue to be listed as Merrill employees on the BrokerCheck website of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and on their LinkedIn social networking pages. Brokerage firms have 30 days to update notices about brokers charged with violations or dismissed.  The BrokerCheck site notes that Brown also owns a bar in Rochester, is a member of the board of trustees of Nazareth College and paid a settlement of $510,905 in 2013 to a customer who alleged the broker misrepresented the potential downside of a commodity option investment. Brown said the client was made fully aware of the risks, according to BrokerCheck. Brown and Goetz were members of Merrill's Private Banking and Investment Group, or P-BIG, which includes about 150 brokerage teams that focus on ultra-wealthy clients with at least $10 million to invest. The unit is headed by John Thiel, who also runs the branch system for the Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> subsidiary that employs about 13,845 U.S. brokers.
