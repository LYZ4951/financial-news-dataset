CAIRO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound <EGP=> held steady at a central bank dollar sale on Wednesday but strengthened on the black market.

The bank said it sold $37.6 million, at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from the previous sale on Monday. The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars are determined by the results of central bank sales <EGYTV3>, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates. The bank offered $40 million on Wednesday. In the unofficial market, one trader said the pound was trading at 7.49 pounds to the dollar at midday on Wednesday, stronger than Monday's rate of 7.50/53.
