OSLO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Norwegian insurer Storebrand <STB.OL> reported a smaller than expected drop in third-quarter results on Wednesday and said it is well prepared for the challenges of a low interest rate level.

Chief Executive Odd Arild Grefstad made the following comments to Reuters after presenting the results:  "We are very pleased with our preparations for the low interest rate level. With the buffers we have built we have a robust balance sheet. The guaranteed products will eventually be reduced and guarantees will be lower, so I feel we have a robust setup even with the low interest rates we have now.  "The number of customers who have moved their traditional paid-up policies to paid-up policies with investment choice is a little higher than expected, so this is a very good start. So far so good, but it's a long race. "The third quarter result is not comparable to the same quarter last year, as that was exceptionally good with one-off effects. The result this quarter implies a group result of NOK 2.5 billion for the year at the same time as we are increasing our longevity reserves, so we are very pleased. "We will continue to cut costs also after our current cost cut program is finished by the end of the year, but we also want to focus on growth. "Competition is tough in our core business, with many providers.
