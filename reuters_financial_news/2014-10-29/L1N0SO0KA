Oct 29 (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP <CG.O> reported a 15 percent year-on-year drop in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, as a halt to this year's stock market rally led to its private equity funds appreciating at a slower pace than a year ago.

The Washington, D.C.-based firm said economic net income (ENI), an earnings metric that factors in the mark-to-market value of its portfolio, was $166 million in the third quarter of 2014 versus $195 million in the corresponding period in 2013. This translated into post-tax ENI per share of 55 cents per adjusted unit in the third quarter of 2014, slightly ahead of the average analyst forecast of 54 cents in a Thomson Reuters poll. Distributable earnings came in at $159 million in the quarter, up from $105 million a year earlier, as Carlyle continued to cash out on its investments. Carlyle's assets under management were $202.6 billion as of the end of September, remaining almost at the same level that they were at the end of June.
