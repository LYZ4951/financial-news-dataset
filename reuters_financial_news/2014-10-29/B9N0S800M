SHANGHAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China shares showed solid gains, with transportation stocks leading the way, on hopes the government will unveil reform measures.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> ended up 1.5 percent at 2,373.2 points, hitting a two-week closing high, while the CSI300 <.CSI300> of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings climbed 1.4 percent. Hopes for reform at state-owned enterprise (SOEs) were lifted as China's domestic media reported that China CNR <601299.SS> <6199.HK> and CSR Corp <601766.SS> <1766.HK> were planning to merge.
