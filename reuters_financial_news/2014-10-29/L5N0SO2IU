LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Britain awarded 21 probation contracts worth around 450 million pounds ($725 million) a year to firms including Interserve <IRV.L>, Sodexo <EHO.PA> and GEO Group <GEO.N> on Wednesday as part of its plans to use more private players and charities to reduce reoffending rates.

The preferred bidders, which included private firms, charities and social enterprise groups, will be responsible for running the bulk of Britain's National Probation Service, which includes working with offenders released from prison, overseeing community orders and supervising unpaid work. Sodexo, the world's No.2 catering services company, which already runs some prisons in the UK, was awarded six contracts in partnership with charity NACRO. Interserve took five contracts as part of a partnership with social enterprise firm 3SC and charities Addaction, P3 and Shelter.
