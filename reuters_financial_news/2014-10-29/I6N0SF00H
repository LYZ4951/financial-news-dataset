MILAN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Fininvest, the holding company of Silvio Berlusconi, said on Wednesday its board had given a mandate to its chief executive to address the request by the Bank of Italy to sell part of its stake in asset manager Mediolanum <MED.MI>.

Earlier this month the Bank of Italy called on Fininvest to sell a 20 percent stake in the asset manager because it no longer considered former prime minister Berlusconi fit to own more than 10 percent of a financial company. [ID:nL6N0S50X7] The central bank has requested the stake sale because of Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud last year. Fininvest, which controls broadcaster Mediaset <MS.MI>, currently holds 30 percent of Mediolanum. The holding company said in a statement that the Bank of Italy had said its request could be met through a transfer of the Mediolanum stake to a trust. "The board... has given the CEO a mandate to respond to the (Bank of Italy) request and press ahead... with the necessary talks with the regulator," Fininvest said. Mediolanum is in the process of registering as a bank, thus falling under the supervision of the Bank of Italy.
