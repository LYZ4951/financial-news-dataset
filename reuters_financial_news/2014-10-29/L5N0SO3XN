DUBAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Most stock markets in the Middle East rose on Wednesday on the back of generally positive third-quarter earnings, but bourses in Dubai and Saudi Arabia, which had outperformed the region earlier in the week, pulled back on profit-taking.

Abu Dhabi's index <.ADI> rose 1.1 percent, largely on the back of First Gulf Bank <FGB.AD>, which jumped 3.1 percent. The lender beat analysts' estimates this week with a 20 percent increase in third-quarter net profit. [ID:nL5N0SM2VX] Shares in National Bank of Abu Dhabi <NBAD.AD> edged up 0.7 percent after it reported a 32 percent rise in third-quarter net profit, slightly ahead of estimates. The lender made 1.37 billion dirhams ($373 million) in the quarter, while analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 1.30 billion dirhams. [ID:nL5N0SN2M0] Qatar's benchmark <.QSI> added 0.9 percent in a broad rally. Property developer Ezdan Holding <ERES.QA>, which this week posted a 41 percent jump in nine-month profit, dominated trading and edged up 0.5 percent. Egypt's bourse <.EGX30> also continued to rally and jumped 2.4 percent as most blue chips gained. However, shares in Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals <SKPC.CA> fell 2.3 percent after it reported a 26 percent drop in nine-month net profit.  DUBAI, SAUDI Dubai's index <.DFMGI> closed 0.1 percent down after going up as much as 1.4 percent during the session. Lender Emirates NBD <ENBD.DU>, whose shares often move sharply because of limited liquidity, was the main drag, falling 2.0 percent. Developer Union Properties <UPRO.DU>, which rose earlier in the session, closed 0.6 percent down while Emaar Properties <EMAR.DU> and Deyaar <DEYR.DU> gave up all gains and were flat. "It's just profit-taking," said Sanyalak Manibhandu, manager of research at NBAD Securities in Abu Dhabi. "There was a bit of a relief rally earlier in the week and I think people are just booking profits now." Dubai had outperformed the region, gaining 8.3 percent between Oct. 19, when markets began to recover, and Tuesday's close. Saudi Arabia's bourse <.TASI> which was the second-best performer in the same period, rising 6.5 percent; it also pulled back on Wednesday and closed 0.8 percent down. One of the major drags was Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) <2010.SE>, which this week posted a 4.5 percent decrease in third-quarter profit on Sunday, missing analysts' estimates. The Saudi insurance sector index <.SINSI> fell 2.5 percent despite strong results posted by a number of companies. The benchmark had gained 19 percent since the beginning of last week, well ahead of the overall market.  WEDNESDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS  DUBAI * The index <.DFMGI> slipped 0.1 percent to 4,622 points.
