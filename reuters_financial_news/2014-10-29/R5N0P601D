SOFIA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's Central Bank Governor Ivan Iskrov will step down as soon as a decision is taken on what to do with Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank) <6C9.BB>, Iskrov told a budget commission in parliament on Wednesday.

The central bank has come under fire from lawmakers and citizens for its handling of a run on deposits at Corpbank in June, which forced the lender to shut down. Iskrov had offered to resign in the run-up to an election on Oct 5.  "Immediately after we find a decision for the Corporate Commercial Bank, after there is stability, a governing majority, I will step down," Iskrov said in televised comments.
