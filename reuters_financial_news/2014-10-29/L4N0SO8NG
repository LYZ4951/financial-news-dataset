SYDNEY, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Australian shares are set to have a muted start on Thursday following disappointing results from the country's fourth lender by market value.

National Australia Bank <NAB.AX> said annual cash profit fell almost 10 percent, its second drop in three years, hit by writedowns for its troubled UK business. [ID:nS9N0RP02P] A small dip on Wall Street after the Federal Reserve ended its stimulative monthly bond-buying program and expressed confidence in U.S. economic prospects is also likely to weigh  on Australian shares.  * Local share price index futures <YAPcm1> rose 1 point to 5,430.0, a 17.7-point discount to the close of the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index <.AXJO> on Wednesday. The benchmark index fell 0.1 percent in the last session. * New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index <.NZ50> was up 0.7 percent in early trade. * Both the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> and S&P 500 <.SPX> fell 0.1 percent after the Fed comments. * Iron ore prices <.IO62-CNI=SI> fell to $78.60 a tonne, but copper prices hit a two-week high. * The Federal Reserve largely dismissed recent financial market volatility in a policy statement, following a two-day meeting, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as unlikely to undercut progress toward its unemployment and inflation goals.  ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2235 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT   LAST   PCT CHG   NET CHG S&P 500 <.SPX>   1982.3  -0.14%-2.750 USD/JPY <JPY=>   108.82  -0.06%-0.060 10-YR US TSY YLD<US10YT=RR>  2.321   -- 0.000 SPOT GOLD   <XAU=>   1212.27  0.06% 0.730 US CRUDE<CLc1>   82  -0.24%-0.200 DOW JONES   <.DJI>   16974.31-0.18%-31.44 ASIA ADRS   <.BKAS>  145.74   0.04%  0.06 -------------------------------------------------------------   * Wall St ends with modest decline after Fed  [.N]   * Oil up as U.S. crude stocks rise less than expected[O/R]   * Gold falls as Fed focuses on bright U.S. outlook  [GOL/]   * Higher stocks pull nickel back from two-week peak[MET/L]  DIARIES & DATA:  U.S. earnings diary  [RESF/US]Wall Street Week Ahead   [.N/O]  Eurostocks Week Ahead  [.EU/O] ................................................................
