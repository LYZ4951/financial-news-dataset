MADRID, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA <BBVA.MC> on Wednesday posted a 37 percent drop in net profit for the first nine months of the year, missing analysts' forecasts, after year-ago earnings were boosted by one-off gains from asset sales.

The country's second-biggest lender, which makes the bulk of revenues overseas, reported a 1.929-billion-euro (2.46 billion US dollar) net profit for the period. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to come in slightly higher at closer to 2 billion euros. [ID:nL5N0SN4A8]
