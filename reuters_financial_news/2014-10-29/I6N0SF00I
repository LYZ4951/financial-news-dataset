MILAN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Highway operator Atlantia <ATL.MI> denied a newspaper report on Wednesday it had hired Goldman Sachs <GS.N> to advise it on a sale of a minority stake in its Aeroporti di Roma unit.

"No mandate has been given to Goldman Sachs and no decision on any eventual project has been taken," the company said in a statement. Il Sole 24 Ore said on Wednesday Atlantia had mandated the U.S. investment bank to sell a 40 percent stake in ADR, which runs Rome's airports.
