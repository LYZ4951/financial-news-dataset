MILAN, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Carige <CRGI.MI> said on Wednesday its Core Tier 1 (CET 1) capital ratio would be boosted by the agreed sale of two insurance units by nearly 100 basis points.

"For Banca Carige the transaction will result in a benefit in terms of the CET 1 ratio fully compliant of approximately 94 bps as of June 30, 2014," the mid-sized lender said in a statement. Carige, which must plug a capital shortfall of 810 million euros uncovered by Europe-wide stress tests of lenders, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal with Apollo Management Holdings to sell it its two insurance units.
