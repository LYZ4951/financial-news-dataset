LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Standard Life <SL.L> posted net inflows of 4.3 billion pounds ($6.94 billion) in the third quarter but said the outlook for the annuity market remained uncertain.

Assets under administration from continuing operations rose to 290 billion pounds, the company said in a trading statement on Wednesday, compared with 237.6 billion pounds a year ago, helped by the acquisition of Ignis Asset Management. But it said changes in annuity regulations in the UK had led to a cut in annuity sales of 55 percent year to date, with a 67 percent drop in sales in the quarter compared with a year ago.
