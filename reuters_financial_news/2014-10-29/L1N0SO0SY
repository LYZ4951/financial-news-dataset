NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Ally Financial Inc <ALLY.N>, the second largest U.S. auto lender, said on Wednesday that its third-quarter profit jumped from a year-earlier loss thanks higher demand for loans from car dealerships.

The bank's net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $356 million, or 76 cents per share, from a loss of $109 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.
