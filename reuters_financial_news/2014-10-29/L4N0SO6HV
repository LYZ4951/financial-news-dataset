Oct 29 (Reuters) - American Realty Capital Properties Inc <ARCP.O> said an audit committee discovered "intentional" accounting errors in certain financial statements and that it would restate some quarterly reports, sending its shares down 37 percent to a record low.

The news wiped out about $4 billion of the real estate investment trust's market capitalization of about $11 billion as of Tuesday. "The accounting issues are unacceptable and we are taking the personnel and other actions necessary to ensure that this does not happen again," Chief Executive David Kay said in a statement on Wednesday. [ID:nPn6DGpPF] American Realty Capital said Chief Financial Officer Brian Block and Chief Accounting Officer Lisa McAlister had resigned, effective immediately. "American Realty Capital's credibility is likely impugned for some period of time as a result of this matter," J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anthony Paolone wrote in a note to clients. American Realty Capital said its financial statements of 2013 and the first two quarters of 2014 could no longer be relied upon. "The company engaged in a number of capital markets transactions during the period whereby these intentional errors were made, which raises the specter of legal issues," Paolone said. JP Morgan and Capital One Securities cut their ratings and price targets on the company's stock. BMO Capital Markets cut its rating. [ID:nL4N0SO6I4] American Realty Capital, previously a non-traded REIT part of Nicholas Schorsch's American Realty Group's portfolio, listed on the Nasdaq in 2011 and became the largest U.S. net-lease REIT with its purchase of Cole Real Estate Investments Inc earlier this year. [ID:nL3N0ID2S5] The company, whose tenants include Walgreen Co <WAG.N> and CVS Caremark Corp <CVS.N> pharmacies, has since sold some businesses to focus on the fast-growing triple-net lease market, where the tenants bear most of the operating costs. American Realty Capital said it did not expect the accounting errors to impact any previously announced transactions. The company said adjustments related to the errors would reduce its funds from operations for the six months ended June 30 by 4 cents to 45 cents per share. Funds from operations are a key metric for REITs as they exclude certain non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization.
