MADRID, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Spain's BBVA <BBVA.MC> plans to issue more so-called additional Tier 1 bonds, or bonds that can be converted into capital, early next year, the bank's head of strategy and finance Jaime Saenz de Tejada said on Wednesday.

BBVA has already issued bonds of this kind in 2013 and this year it sold 1.5 billion euros (1.91 billion US dollar) of the debt, which is also known as contingent convertible bonds or CoCo bonds.
