SINGAPORE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp <OCBC.SI>, Singapore's second-biggest lender, posted a 62 percent rise in quarterly profit, beating expectations, thanks to strong loan growth, higher margins and a one-off gain from a China-related acquisition.

OCBC earned S$1.23 billion in the three months ending in September, compared with S$759 million a year earlier.  The third quarter result included a one-off gain of S$391 million from an increased stake in Chinese lender Bank of Ningbo <002142.SZ>, which became a 20 percent-owned subsidiary.
