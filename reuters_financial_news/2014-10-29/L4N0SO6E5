TEL AVIV, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Bank Leumi <LUMI.TA>, Israel's second-largest bank, said the New York Department of Financial Services had told the bank's lawyers in a phone call that a tax probe could be settled for $300 million.

"This suggestion was made without any basis in documents or calculations," Leumi said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on Wednesday. "The statement made over the phone was immediately rejected by the bank's American lawyers."
