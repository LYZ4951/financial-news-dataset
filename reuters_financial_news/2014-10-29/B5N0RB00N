BRUSSELS, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission will not penalise countries which missed budget targets this year, the EU executive's outgoing economics chief said on Wednesday.

Asked if the Commission could fine countries such as France and Italy for missing agreed targets this year, Commissioner Jyrki Katainen told a news briefing: "No."
