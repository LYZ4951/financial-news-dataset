Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and signaled confidence the U.S. economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy.

STORY: [ID:nTLATLEA08]  TEXT: [ID:nFOMTLEA2B] KEY POINTS: * The Fed retained its basic language regarding interest rates from recent statements, saying that rates would remain low for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases this month * Vote was 9-1, with Narayana Kocherlakota dissenting  COMMENTS: RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "Investors are caught between is it true the economy is better? In which case stock prices can continue to rise. Or is it just that there's no more liquidity being pumped into the market? In which case asset prices are more likely to fall. That has been an issue investors have thought about now for the last couple of months, and now it's right in front of them. "The initial reaction is that this market was more supported by low interest rates than by earnings gains. That's just the initial reaction. Whether people change that view, even later today, the first thought of people is that without the liquidity pump of the Fed, stock prices would be lower."  JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT BMO PRIVATE BANK IN CHICAGO: "It looks like no big surprises. Investors were probably hoping for something that would suggest they would stay permanently on hold (for a rate hike). They repeated language from September that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat. So they have kept the door open for an imminent rate hike, at least rhetorically speaking, but I don't think it is going to happen."  On stocks drop: "It just wasn't quite as dovish as investors had hoped. It didn't look like it referenced anything about weakness in Europe or among our trading partners, commenting that inflation won't stay low forever, so it's still pretty much that same hawkish/dovish bent as last month."  WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES IN NEW YORK: "The Fed's announcement is exactly what everyone expected. The Fed sees enough improvement in economic activity to end QE, but at the same time, it will keep low rates because it isn't yet seeing what it wants to see as far as inflation goes. That's what everyone expected. Policy is still very accommodative.  "Stocks are falling a bit because the recent rally brought us to very overbought levels, so we need to consolidate a little bit. Overall I'm comfortable with the level of the market. It made sense that we fell, and that we rebounded. We're counseling clients to be selective with what they buy, but otherwise we're bullish. Steady as she goes."
