FRANKFURT/MADRID, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Germany's biggest utility E.ON <EONGn.DE> is asking bidders to submit binding offers for its Spanish business by Nov. 3, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding the assets are likely to fetch as much as 2.2 billion euros ($2.8 billion).

Potential bidders include Australia's Macquarie <MQG.AX>, private equity firm CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL] and Spain's largest utility Endesa <ELE.MC>, which is controlled by Italy's Enel <ENEI.MI>, the sources said.
