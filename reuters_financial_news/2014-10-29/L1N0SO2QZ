NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Brokerage and investment bank Raymond James Financial Inc <RJF.N> said on Wednesday its revenues climbed to a record high $1.29 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up 14 percent from last year, while profits climbed more slowly than the previous quarter.

The St. Petersburg, Florida-based company reported profits climbed 16 percent from last year, less than the fiscal third quarter's sharp 46 percent jump, as acquisition-related expenses pressured incomes.
