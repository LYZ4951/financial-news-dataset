DUBAI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Commercial Bank of Qatar <COMB.QA>, the Gulf Arab state's second-largest lender by assets, reported a 79 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations.

The bank earned a net profit of 503 million riyals ($130.8 million) for the three months to Sept. 30. That compares with a profit of 280.9 million riyals in the year-earlier period.  Analysts had on average forecast quarterly profit of 457.8 riyals, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nL6N0PI1EL]
