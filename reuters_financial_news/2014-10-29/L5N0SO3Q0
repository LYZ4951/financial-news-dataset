LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The unmanned U.S. supply rocket which exploded shortly after lift-off late on Tuesday was insured for around $40-50 million of losses, insurance sources said, though one pinned the loss more specifically at $48 million.

The 14-story Antares rocket, built and launched by Orbital Sciences Corp <ORB.N>, blasted off from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia at 2222 GMT on Tuesday but burst into flames moments later and plunged back to the ground in a massive ball of fire and smoke.
