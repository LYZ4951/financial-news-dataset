Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and signaled confidence the U.S. economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy.

STORY: [ID:nTLATLEA08]  TEXT: [ID:nFOMTLEA2B] KEY POINTS: * The Fed retained its basic language regarding interest rates from recent statements, saying that rates would remain low for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases this month * Vote was 9-1, with Narayana Kocherlakota dissenting  COMMENTS:  WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES IN NEW YORK: "The Fed's announcement is exactly what everyone expected. The Fed sees enough improvement in economic activity to end QE, but at the same time, it will keep low rates because it isn't yet seeing what it wants to see as far as inflation goes. That's what everyone expected. Policy is still very accommodative.  "Stocks are falling a bit because the recent rally brought us to very overbought levels, so we need to consolidate a little bit. Overall I'm comfortable with the level of the market. It made sense that we fell, and that we rebounded. We're counseling clients to be selective with what they buy, but otherwise we're bullish. Steady as she goes."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes, down modestly ahead of the statement, fell further to the day's low BONDS:  U.S. bond yields rose to the highest since Oct 8 FOREX:  The dollar rose against the euro  (Americas Economics and Markets Desk; +1-646 223-6300)  Keywords: USA ECONOMY/INSTANT
