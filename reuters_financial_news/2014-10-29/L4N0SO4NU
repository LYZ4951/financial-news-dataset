SINGAPORE, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Thailand's Jasmine Broadband Internet Growth Infrastructure Fund plans to start premarketing for its initial public offering of up to $1 billion in early November, IFR reported.

The fund is targeting a yield of 7 percent to 8 percent and could have market capitalisation of 55 billion to 70 billion baht ($1.7 billion to $2.2 billion), according to IFR. The IPO was delayed in 2013 due to legal complications as well as political uncertainty in Thailand.
