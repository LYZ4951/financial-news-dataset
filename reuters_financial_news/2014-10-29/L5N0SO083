WARSAW, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Polish central banker Andrzej Rzonca has reiterated that there is no need to cut rates further from their lowest level in history, as the Polish economy is not in a crisis.

"Just now the reference rate accounts to 2 percent. In late autumn of 2008 when the global crisis was in its deepest phase it was 3.5 percent," Rzonca said in an interview with Gazeta Wyborcza daily published on Wednesday.
