FRANKFURT, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> reported a quarterly net loss of 92 million euros on Wednesday as heavy legal costs outweighed a rise in investment banking earnings.

Germany's top lender reported quarterly pretax income of 266 million euros, lifted by a 4 percent pre-tax profit rise from investment banking.
