BRASILIA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, surprising investors who expected policymakers to stay put until President Dilma Rousseff unveils policy changes following her narrow re-election victory on Sunday.

All 43 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll expected the central bank to keep its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> unchanged at 11 percent.
