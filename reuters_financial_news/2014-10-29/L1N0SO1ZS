NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Prices on U.S. 30-year agency mortgage-backed securities extended their earlier decline Wednesday mid-afternoon after the Federal Reserve as expected decided to end its monthly purchases of MBS and Treasuries. [ID:nTLATLEA08]

Prices on 30-year mortgage-backed securities that carry a 3-percent coupon and are guaranteed by Fannie Mae <USF3030=RR> fell to a session low of 99-25/32, down 11/32 from late on Tuesday. The yield on the 30-year, 3-percent Fannie Mae MBS issue was 3.02 percent, up 4 basis points on the day.  In other areas of the bond market, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities lagged regular Treasuries as the Fed acknowledged the recent decline in oil prices has clamped down on domestic inflation, although it still expects inflation to achieve its 2 percent goal. The inflation breakeven rate of yield gaps between TIPS and nominal government debt narrowed in reaction to the latest Fed policy statement.
