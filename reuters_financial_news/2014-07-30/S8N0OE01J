DUBLIN, July 30 (Reuters) - It will likely be 2015 before Allied Irish Banks <ALBK.I> (AIB) is able to grow its net loan book as repayments continue to outweigh an increase in drawdowns, chief executive David Duffy said on Wednesday.

State-owned AIB returned to profit in the first half of the year as bad debts fell sharply and it said the key challenge it faced was growing a still shrinking net loan book. [ID:nL6N0Q51RV]
