WARSAW, July 30 (Reuters) - Poland's second largest bank, Pekao <PEO.WA>, is expected to report an 11 percent fall in net profit for the second quarter, as last year's result was higher than usual thanks to exceptionally good numbers on bonds sales, a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday.

Pekao, which is controlled by Italian lender UniCredit <CRDI.MI>, may report a net profit of 662 million zlotys ($213.58 million) in the second quarter, according to the average of forecasts given by 11 banks and brokerages. "This is mainly the high base effect. In the second quarter of 2013 the bank booked 153 million zlotys on bonds sale and it was not possible, for sure, to repeat this result in the second quarter of 2014," Michal Fidelus of DI Investors said. Analysts expect that in the whole first half of the year Pekao achieved around 1.3 billion zlotys of net profit.
