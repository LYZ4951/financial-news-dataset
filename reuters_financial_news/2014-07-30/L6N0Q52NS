MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - Russian Agricultural Bank said on Wednesday it did not expect any negative impact on its business from the latest round of Western economic sanctions.

The United States imposed sanctions on Russian Agriculture Bank, along with Russia's second-largest lender VTB <VTBR.MM> and its subsidiary the Bank of Moscow, on Tuesday over Moscow's perceived support for pro-Russian rebels fighting government forces in Ukraine. The European Union also announced measures limiting access to capital for Russian banks.
