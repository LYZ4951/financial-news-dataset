LIMA, July 30 (Reuters) - Peru's economy will likely expand by 4 percent to 4.5 percent in 2014, less than previously estimated, after a convergence of mainly external factors dragged down second-quarter growth much more than expected, Finance Minister Luis Miguel Castilla said in an interview on Wednesday.

The finance ministry said in April that the global minerals exporter's economy would likely grow by 5.7 percent this year. But low mineral prices, a tightening of U.S. monetary policy and weak mining output had a bigger impact on growth in the first half of the year than predicted, Castilla said, and would leave the second quarter with a 2 percent year-on-year expansion. That would be Peru's slowest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2009, when the Andean country was recovering from the global financial crisis. Growth statistics for June are scheduled to be released in August. However, Castilla, speaking at his offices in Lima, said the economy will start to turn around in the third quarter as the impacts of recent economic reforms, a boost in public spending and a slated increase in mining production begin to bear fruit.  Peru's ballooning current account and trade deficits are not a concern, as big new mines scheduled to ramp up next year will put exports on track to outpace imports in 2016, Castilla said. His ministry had previously forecast a $61 million trade surplus for next year. The government is now considering making additional changes to the tax code, including a possible cut to the corporate tax rate, to make Peru more globally competitive, he added. Castilla also said the government will likely sell a 20 percent stake in the public electrical distribution group Distriluz this year - part of a bid to raise public funds and modernize services. Distriluz has 1.9 million clients, according to its website.
