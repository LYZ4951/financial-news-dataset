HONG KONG, July 30 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's property sub-index <.HSNP> climbed to a 14-month high on Wednesday, lifted by Cheung Kong Holdings <0001.HK> and Sun Hung Kai Properties <0016.HK>, as investors bet on a solid performance for first-half earnings.

The city's real estate sub-index <.HSNP> has risen more than 27 percent since lows hit in March and is now at its highest level since May last year. At 0502 GMT, Cheung Kong, whose first-half results are due on Thursday, spiked 2 percent to a record high, while Sun Hung Kai rose 2.7 percent to its highest level since March 2013.  Shares in smaller rival Hang Lung Properties <0101.HK>, whose earnings are also due on Thursday, rose 3 percent after having jumped 20 percent since mid-March.  Morgan Stanley this week revised up its forecasts for Hong Kong's home prices this year to a 5 percent gain from a 10 percent drop.
