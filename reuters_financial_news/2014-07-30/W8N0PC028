WARSAW, Jul 30 (Reuters) - Poland's fourth largest lender mBank <MBK.WA> reported an almost 20-percent rise in its second-quarter net profit, in line with market forecasts, because of higher net interest income, it said on Wednesday.

The bank, a unit of Germany's Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, said its net profit stood at 325 million zlotys ($105 million) compared to 329 million expected by analysts.
