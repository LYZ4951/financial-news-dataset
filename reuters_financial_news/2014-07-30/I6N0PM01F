MILAN, July 30 (Reuters) - Italian asset manager Mediolanum <MED.MI> could be in a position to offer investors a more generous dividend policy thanks to its strong capital position, the group's deputy chairman told Reuters on Wednesday.

"Our strong core Tier 1 could allow us to modify our dividend policy which currently distributes 50 percent of profits," Massimo Doris said in an interview. Doris said it was possible a new dividend policy could be introduced as early as 2015 on this year's results. Mediolanum had a Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of 18.09 percent at the end of June. Doris said he also expected total net inflows in 2014 to beat the 3.3 billion euros ($4.4 billion) seen in 2013.
