MADRID, July 30 (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Popular <POP.MC> on Wednesday posted a 25 percent drop in first half net profit, beating forecasts even though it hiked provisions against soured assets as lending revenue fell slightly less than expected from a year ago.

Popular, Spain's sixth-biggest bank by market value, said profit was 128.5 million euros ($172 million) in the January-June period, above of 124 million euros expected by analysts polled by Reuters. [ID:nL6N0Q03PI]
