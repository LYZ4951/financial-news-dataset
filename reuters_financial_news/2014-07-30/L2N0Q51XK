NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - U.S. equity mutual funds posted a thirteenth consecutive week of outflows, the Investment Company Institute said on Wednesday, while world stocks and bond funds attracted money.

Stock funds overall saw net outflows of $1.26 billion for the week ended July 23. U.S. funds accounted for all of that figure and then some, posting net outflows of $3.37 billion, continuing a pullback in allocation to U.S. equities begun in April. Conversely, world equity funds attracted $2.12 billion in net inflows. Those funds have seen net inflows every week since May 2013, according to the U.S. mutual fund trade organization. Flows to world stock funds have persisted even as those equities trail their U.S. counterparts. The MSCI All-World Stock Index <.MIWD00000PUS> is up 4.9 percent so far in 2014, trailing the S&P 500 <.SPX> index's rise of 6.4 percent. "For retail investors, a big part of it is taking some gains and really looking at the their stock portfolio and being nervous about the gains that we've seen in the stock market," said Erich Patten, portfolio manager with Cutler Investment Group, in Seattle.  "The U.S. stock market's been one of the best performing stock markets over the past couple of years. Mutual fund investors are very aware of how the U.S. stock market has done," he said. Equity hybrid and bond funds also posted net inflows. Total bond fund inflows came to $1.46 billion, with taxable bond inflows of $577 million and municipal bond fund inflows of $884 million. Hybrid funds, which can invest in stocks and fixed-income securities, attracted $1.12 billion in net inflows.
