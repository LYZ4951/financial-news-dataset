MADRID, July 30 (Reuters) - Spain's second-biggest bank BBVA <BBVA.MC> on Wednesday reported a 39 percent fall in second-quarter net profit as lending revenue dropped and earnings a year ago were boosted by gains from asset sales.

BBVA said net income was 704 million euros, versus the 706 million euros forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. [IDLnL6N0Q43WI]
