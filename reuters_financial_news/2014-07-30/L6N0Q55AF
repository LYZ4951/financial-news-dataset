ROME, July 30 (Reuters) - Troubled Italian airline Alitalia may raise the size of a capital hike agreed last week to 300 million euros ($401.13 million) to smooth the way for a tie-up with Abu Dhabi's Etihad, a person close to Alitalia shareholders said on Wednesday.

Alitalia's shareholders approved a capital increase of up to 250 million euros last week as part of a bid to meet the conditions Etihad has set to buy 49 percent of the flagship airline. "The capital hike could rise to 300 million euros," the source said.
