LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Barclays <BARC.L> said trading activity in its investment bank had slowed this month and July could be the unit's weakest month so far this year.

"It's probably been the slowest month for us this year," Finance Director Tushar Morzaria told analysts on a conference call, saying the slowdown had been across the business. "Is it just a regular summer slowdown? It could be, it's hard to tell," he added.
