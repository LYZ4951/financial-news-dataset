July 30 (Reuters) - Equity markets will see a decline at some point after rising for the past several years, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.

"The stock market has recovered so sharply for so long, you have to assume somewhere along the line we will get a significant correction," Greenspan said on Wednesday.  Greenspan's comments come amidst growing concern that interest rates near record lows are creating asset-price bubbles.
