MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - Russia's Bank of Moscow <MMBM.MM> is not suffering from a new round of Western sanctions and the bank is not planning to borrow on foreign markets, the bank said on Wednesday.

The United States imposed sanctions on more Russian banks on Tuesday, targeting the country's second-largest lender VTB <VTBR.MM>, its subsidiary the Bank of Moscow, and the Russian Agriculture Bank.
