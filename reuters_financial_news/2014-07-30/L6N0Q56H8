LISBON, July 30 (Reuters) - Portugal's CMVM securities market regulator announced a one-day ban on short selling in shares of Banco Espirito Santo <BES.LS> and retailer Jeronimo Martins <JMT.LS> for Thursday after their shares fell sharply on Wednesday, CMVM said in a statement.

Shares in Banco Espirito Santo fell 10.6 percent ahead of first-half results due later on Wednesday on concerns the bank will book a massive loss due to its exposure to liabilities of its troubled founding family and will require a capital hike. {ID:nL6N0Q54KR] Separately, Jeronimo Martins shares slumped 13.5 percent in their worst drop in more than 5 years after the company warned on margin pressures in its key market Poland.
