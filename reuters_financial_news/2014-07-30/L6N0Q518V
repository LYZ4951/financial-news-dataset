MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Russia's second-largest bank VTB <VTBR.MM>, targeted by the latest sanctions from the United States, opened down 3 percent on Wednesday, while the broad stock market and the rouble were stable.

At 0604 GMT, the dollar-denominated RTS index <IRTS> was down 0.1 percent at 1,206 points, after opening 0.6 percent lower.
