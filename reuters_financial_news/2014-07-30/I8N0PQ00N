MUMBAI, July 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Indian conglomerate Larsen and Toubro <LART.NS> fell 3.2 percent at pre-open trading after the company's April-June net profit, adjusted for exceptional items worth 2.49 billion rupees, missed estimates.

Exceptional gain represents gain on divestment of a strategic investment and stake in subsidiary companies, the company said in a statement on Monday.
