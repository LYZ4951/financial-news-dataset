LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - European private equity firm Charterhouse [CHCAP.UL] is readying the sale of UK skincare company Deb Group this year in a deal worth about 500 million pounds ($845 million) including debt, four sources with knowledge of the talks said on Wednesday.

Charterhouse has invited banks to pitch for a mandate and is close to appointing one to run the sale, the sources said, with one adding that the deal would likely go ahead in late October.
