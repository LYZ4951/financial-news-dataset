FRANKFURT, July 30 (Reuters) - Euro zone banks eased credit standards for corporate loans in the second quarter for the first time in seven years and demand for such loans is expected to rise in the coming three months, the European Central Bank said on Wednesday.

The ECB said in its latest quarterly Bank Lending Survey that banks reported an increase in corporate loan demand in Germany and Spain, but they reported falls in France and the Netherlands. "With respect to banks' replies to the biannual question related to the impact of supervisory and regulatory actions, banks indicated a further strengthening of their capital position and a slight increase in their risk-weighted assets," the ECB added in the report.  The ECB said that a net 3 percent of the euro zone banks that took part in the survey eased their criteria for firms to borrow in the second quarter, compared to the 1 percent that tightened their criteria in the first quarter. For home loans, banks eased credit standards in net terms.
