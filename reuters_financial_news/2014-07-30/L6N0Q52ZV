LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - The $50 billion Russia has been ordered to pay former shareholders of now-defunct oil company Yukos could hit the country's sovereign credit rating, Moody's said on Wednesday.    "We consider this event as credit negative for Russia as it poses a significant contingent liability for the sovereign," Moody's said in a statement.
