MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - Russia's Central Bank said on Wednesday it was ready to support domestic banks that were hit in the latest round of Western sanctions.

The United States imposed sanctions on more Russian banks on Tuesday, targeting the country's second-largest lender VTB <VTBR.MM>, its subsidiary the Bank of Moscow, and the Russian Agriculture Bank. The European Union also announced measures limiting access to capital for Moscow.
