SHANGHAI, July 30 (Reuters) - China's Jiangxi province will issue a total of 14.3 billion yuan ($2.32 billion) of five-, seven- and 10-year municipal bonds on August 5, according to an announcement posted on a website for major Chinese bond issues (www.chinabond.com.cn).

Jiangxi province is the fourth local government to issue municipal bonds following Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces which issued such bonds earlier this year.[ID:nL4N0P40FY][ID:nB9N0OL00K][ID:nL4N0PS2B7] The Ministry of Finance said in late May that 10 local governments had been given quotas to issue a combined 109.2 billion yuan of municipal bonds this year. [ID:nB9N0NA02D] The ministry has also allowed selected local governments to directly issue and redeem their own bonds to help tackle a $3 trillion public debt problem, launching China's first-ever municipal bond market. Governments in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, Qingdao, Ningxia and Jiangxi are included in the pilot scheme. [ID:nL3N0O710I] Other governments are prevented from directly issuing debt, relying on the Ministry of Finance to issue and redeem bonds on their behalf, or creating special-purpose investment vehicles for fundraising purposes.
