MOSCOW, July 30 (Reuters) - The Moscow-based Association of European Businesses (AEB) said on Wednesday it "deeply regrets" new sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia.

"Considering the volume of trade between Russia and the EU, and Russia and Ukraine, the AEB expects that these new sanctions will not only hurt the Russian economy, but also will restrict growth in both the EU and Ukraine," it said in a statement.
