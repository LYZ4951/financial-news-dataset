FRANKFURT, July 30 (Reuters) - Telefonica Deutschland <O2Dn.DE> on Wednesday reported a 14.5 percent drop in core earnings due to lower revenues from its wireless services and heavy investments to gain market share.

The company, which is controlled by Spain's Telefonica <TEF.MC>, reported a decline in second-quarter operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) to 265 million euros ($355.2 million), which still beat consensus for 246 million euros in a Reuters poll: [ID:nL6N0Q20WF] Telefonica Deutschland last month received regulatory approval to buy the German business of Dutch peer KPN <KPN.AS>, which operates under the E-Plus brand, to create Germany's largest telecoms operator in terms of customers.
