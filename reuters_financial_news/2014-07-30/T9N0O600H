TOKYO, July 30 (Reuters) - Japanese drinks maker Suntory Holdings Ltd [SUNTH.UL] is set to secure $2 billion in subordinated loans from the state-run Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) as part of financing its purchase of U.S. spirits company Beam Inc., a person familiar with the deal said.

The deal, which is expected to signed as early as Thursday, comes on top of $1 billion in subordinated loans from Japan's top three banks and about 10 regional lenders, which was agreed on Wednesday. Suntory said the 60-year subordinated loans arranged by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group <8306.T>, Mizuho Financial Group <8411.T> and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group <8316.T> consists of $500 million in dollars and another $500 million in yen. The privately held beverage company has been tapping a range of lenders to ensure longer-term funding of its recently completed $13.6 billion purchase of the maker of Jim Beam and Maker's Mark bourbons.
