NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open on Wednesday after the first read on second-quarter economic growth came in much stronger than expected, overshadowing a weak report on the labor market.

* Gross domestic product grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, above the 3 percent rate that had been expected and a sharp reversal from the weather-impacted first quarter, when the economy contracted 2.9 percent. [ID:nLNSUIEAJ0] * Futures added to gains following the report, but had already been on track to open higher as investors sought bargains following a period of weakness.  * Market participants shrugged off the ADP National Employment Report, which showed that companies hired 218,000 workers in July, a level that was below analysts' projections and was also down from June. [ID:nZON228B00] * Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> surged 25 percent to $48.25 in heavy premarket trading a day after reporting that monthly active users had risen a better-than-expected 24 percent in the second quarter. The social networking company also gave a revenue outlook that was above forecasts. [ID:nL2N0Q42DR] <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Morning Call: Twitter soars on stellar results http://reut.rs/1qDVhEq ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> * The results could bolster support for Internet and other social media stocks, assuaging concerns the group is overpriced. Facebook Inc <FB.O>, which also posted strong results this quarter and is up almost 35 percent this year, rose 0.9 percent to $74.37 before the bell. * Among other earnings, American Express Co <AXP.N> late Tuesday reported adjusted earnings that were in line with expectations, while WellPoint Inc's <WLP.N> earnings beat expectations. [ID:nL4N0Q467O] [ID:nL2N0Q50H9] * S&P 500 e-mini futures <ESc1> rose 8.75 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures <1YMc1> gained 66 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures <NQc1> rose 23 points.  * The S&P 500 has slipped 0.9 percent over the past three sessions, and on Tuesday it closed below its 14-day moving average for the first time since July 17. That level had served as support of late, and staying decisively below it would be a sign that near-term momentum is weakening. * While this earnings season has been positive in aggregate, with more companies than usual beating expectations for both earnings and revenue, there have been some high-profile disappointments that worry investors about the state of the economy. On Tuesday, UPS <UPS.N> gave a weak outlook that weighed on the broader markets, and last week Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> and Boeing Co <BA.N> disappointed.
