HANOI, July 30 (Reuters) - Vietnam's benchmark VN Index <.VNI> closed down 0.49 percent on Wednesday, with shares of property firm FLC Group Co <FLC.HM> bucking the trend on solid corporate results.

FLC shares rose 3.2 percent to its highest close since April 14, with volume accounting for 30 percent of the total shares traded on Wednesday, Reuters data showed. "Investors tend to trade on stocks with high liquidity for quick profits when the market trend is unclear," said analyst Tran Thang Long of BIDV Securities. The index is likely to hover around the current level or fall in coming weeks, analysts said, adding that Moody's upgrading its credit rating for Vietnam on Tuesday did not have any immediate effect on the market.
