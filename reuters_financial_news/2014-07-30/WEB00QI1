ZURICH, July 30 (Reuters) - Swiss bank Vontobel Holding <VONN.S> said on Wednesday first half net profit fell 3 percent from a year earlier, slightly exceeding expectations.

Net profit at the bank for the first six months of the year was 73.5 million Swiss francs ($81.06 million). This topped expectations in an analyst poll conducted by Reuters, which averaged 70.8 million francs. [ID:nL6N0Q339C] Net new money at the Zurich-based firm for the first half of the year was zero, as modest gains at its private bank were cancelled out by outflows at Vontobel's asset management arm.
