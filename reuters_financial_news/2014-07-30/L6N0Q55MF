LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - European shares closed lower on Wednesday, little moved by strong U.S. growth data, after weak earnings reports from cement-makers and concerns about a possible escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Holcim's <HOLN.VX> and HeidelbergCement's <HEIG.DE> shares fell 4.8 percent and 2.9 percent respectively, leaving the STOXX Europe 600 constructions and materials index <.SXOP> down 1.4 percent. [ID:nL6N0Q511N] [ID:nWEB00QIA] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> provisionally closed 0.5 percent lower at 1,366.69 after a choppy session.  The index extended losses in the afternoon as NATO said the number of Russian troops and weaponry along the border with Ukraine was increasing to "well over 12,000".
