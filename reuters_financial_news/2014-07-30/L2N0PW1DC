SAO PAULO, July 30 (Reuters) - Brazil's largest banks are likely to post mixed second-quarter results due to a weak economy and rising defaults, with private-sector lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA expected to outperform rivals because of its ability to raise the cost of credit, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Wednesday.

Expense controls and steps to boost fee-related income helped Itaú <ITUB4.SA> protect earnings against the effects of Brazil's economic slowdown, the poll showed. But the downturn, coupled with higher borrowing costs, caused loan delinquencies to rise slightly after seven straight quarters of drops. To stave off the impact of defaults, Banco Bradesco SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA and state-run Banco do Brasil SA probably scaled up loan-loss provisions during the quarter, analysts said. The banks may also keep their estimates for this year largely unchanged from February. The earnings season for Brazilian banks starts on Thursday, when Bradesco <BBDC4.SA> and Santander Brasil <SANB11.SA> announce results before markets open. Itaú will release earnings on Aug. 5, and Banco do Brasil <BBAS3.SA>, on Aug. 14. The results may not affect stock movement, which has gradually become more tied to the October presidential election than to fundamentals. Shares of Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Itaú and Santander Brasil are up an average 27 percent this year, even they face increased headwinds in the short term. "Bank earnings should be fairly uneventful" said Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Tito Labarta. "Despite continued weakness in the economy, earnings will show a continuation of recent trends."<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ TABLE on second-quarter bank results: [ID:nL2N0PZ27I] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Itaú's recurring profit, which excludes special items, probably reached 4.634 billion reais ($2.1 billion), its second-highest quarterly ever result, the poll found. The bank's return on equity probably hit 22 percent, the highest in the poll's sample. Quarterly data may show that Itaú kept regaining loan pricing power ahead of rivals, the poll found. Competition from Banco do Brasil receded in recent months, allowing private-sector banks to hike lending rates from the record lows of early 2013. Yet room for further expansion of spreads, the difference between a bank's lending and deposit rates, is diminishing. Spreads probably narrowed at Santander Brasil and Banco do Brasil, highlighting their limited ability to price new credit at higher rates. All four banks kept growing in less-risky, lower-yielding segments such as mortgages and payroll loans to fend off lending risk, while stepping up sales of financial services such as insurance and card products tied to checking and savings accounts, the poll found. Banco do Brasil had the lowest default ratio in the poll, at 2 percent, because of a jump in loan disbursements. The bank's loan book probably rose 4.4 percent on a quarterly basis, compared with an average of 2.2 percent for Itaú, Bradesco and Santander Brasil, the poll found.
