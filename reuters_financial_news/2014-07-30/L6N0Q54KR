LISBON, July 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Espirito Santo fell 11 percent ahead of first-half results due on Wednesday on concerns the bank will book a massive loss due to its exposure to liabilities of its troubled founding family and will require a capital hike.

The shares hit new all-time lows of 0.343 euros in afternoon trading before rolling back slightly to 0.35 by 1259 GMT. Top shareholder Espirito Santo Financial Group <ESF.LS>, controlled by the Espirito Santo banking family, was granted protection from creditors on Tuesday.
