ANTANANARIVO, July 30 (Reuters) - Madagascar raised its inflation forecast, due to planned cuts in fuel subsidies, and its revenue projection in a bill of amendments to the budget, which is expected to be voted on by parliament in the next few days.

It kept its economic growth forecast at 3 percent, which is below the World Bank's projection of 3.7 percent. The government said new investment would lift growth in 2015 but did not give a forecast. The World Bank sees growth rising to 4 percent next year, but has said that even that level was not enough to significantly alleviate poverty on the Indian Ocean island nation.  The economy was hammered by a 2009 coup that plunged the nation into a five-year political crisis from which it is slowly recovering since the election in December of President Hery Rajaonarimampianina passed off peacefully. "The forecast growth rate is maintained at 3.0 percent for 2014," the government said. The mining industry would be a major driver for growth, it said. Madagascar had drawn investors up to 2009 to exploit its deposits of nickel, titanium, cobalt, iron coal and uranium but many firms dropped or scaled back plans in subsequent years. The government, in its note, said inflation would climb to 7.0 percent at the end of the year from an initial forecast of 6.2 percent, which it said was due to plans to scale back on fuel subsidies. The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month that the government should review its fuel subsidies, saying wealthier classes benefited more than the poor.

With tax revenues expected to climb, the note said total revenue and grants was expected to reach 3.67 trillion ariary ($1.47 billion) for the year 2014, higher than an initial forecast of 3.07 trillion ariary. The increase would be due to taxes and donor aid. Several international institutions and donors cut back on support for Madagascar after the 2009 coup, but since then the World Bank and others have announced they were normalising ties and outlined new grants and loans to support the country.
