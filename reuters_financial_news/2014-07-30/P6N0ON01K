PARIS, July 30 (Reuters) - European shares dipped in early trade on Wednesday, with Total <TOTF.PA> falling on worries over its investments in Russia and after posting a drop in profits.

Shares in the French oil major dropped 2.6 percent after revealing that it stopped buying shares in Russia's Novatek <NVTK.MM> the day of the downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine. [ID:nP6N0O900Z] At 0705 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares was down 0.1 percent at 1,372.21 points, after gaining 0.3 percent on Tuesday. Bucking the trend, Peugeot <PEUP.PA> surged 6.7 percent after the carmaker arrowed its first-half loss and posted the first positive contribution from its core auto division in three years. [ID:nL6N0Q51H4] Investors also awaited U.S. growth figures for the second quarter, due at 1230 GMT, as well as the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting and its statement set to be released at 18:00 GMT.
