BANGKOK, July 30 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets were mostly weaker on Wednesday, with the Philippine benchmark recovering from a fall in the previous session before the central bank's interest rate decision while the Thai index touched an over-three-week low.

The Philippine main index <.PSI> ended up 0.3 percent after a fall on Monday to its lowest close since July 15. It was shut on Tuesday for a market holiday. The Philippine central bank is likely to continue its gradual policy tightening at a meeting on Thursday but economists in a Reuters poll were divided on exactly how it would do it and were split down the middle on whether it would raise its main rate. [ID:nL4N0Q30M8] Bangkok's SET index <.SETI> ended down 0.1 percent at 1,518.79, falling at one point to 1,500.05, the lowest since July 7. Others in the regions were little changed as investors  awaited second-quarter U.S. growth data as well as a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting that some believe might yield a more hawkish policy outlook. [MKTS/GLOB] Indonesia <.JKSE> remained shut through the week.
