NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital, a top shareholder in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc <VRX.TO>, supports the company's standalone plan and does not believe the Canadian drugmaker has to buy Allergan Inc <AGN.N>, the investor told Reuters on Monday.

ValueAct likes a potential combination between Valeant and its takeover target Allergan, but said a drawn-out bidding war for the Botox maker might be too distracting. "A year on the sidelines waiting for (Allergan) to do a scorched earth sort of defense is a huge cost to Valeant," ValueAct Chief Executive Jeff Ubben told Reuters in an interview.
