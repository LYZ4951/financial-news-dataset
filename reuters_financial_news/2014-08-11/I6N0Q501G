MILAN, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Shares in Banco Popolare <BAPO.MI> rose more than 5 percent to a three-day high in early trading on Monday after Italy's fourth biggest bank reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results.

After the market closed on Friday, Banco Popolare beat expectations by posting a net profit for the second quarter, but said charges for losses on bad debts had risen in the period from a year earlier. By 0715 GMT the stock was up 5.6 percent at 10.63 euros. Following the results, Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Banco Popolare to 'outperform' from 'neutral', reducing its target price to 13.2 euros from 13.8 euros.
