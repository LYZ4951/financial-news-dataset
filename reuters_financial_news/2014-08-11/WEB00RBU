FRANKFURT, Aug 11 (Reuters) - German industrial services company Bilfinger <GBFG.DE> has received a "surprisingly huge" amount of interest from potential buyers of its construction unit, Chief Finance Officer Joachim Mueller said on Monday.

Speaking to reporters after the company released its second-quarter results, he said the information package regarding the construction unit has already been sent out to potential bidders. He said strategic and financial investors were among the "more than a handful" of interested buyers. He also said Bilfinger was looking for potential acquisitions in the United States in the industrial services area.
