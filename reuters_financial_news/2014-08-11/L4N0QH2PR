Aug 11 (Reuters) - State-owned China Reinsurance Corp, the country's biggest reinsurer, plans an initial public offering of up to $2 billion in Hong Kong, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the deal.

A representative of the company could not be immediately reached for comment. Beijing is trying to give private capital a bigger role in China's massive and debt-laden state sector. In July, a Chinese government agency overseeing state-owned firms identified six companies that will be part of the reform process. China Reinsurance Corp was not among those listed.[ID:nL4N0PQ29F]
