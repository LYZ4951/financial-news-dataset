OSLO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Norway's Sparebank 1 SMN <MING.OL> will merge its in-house investment banking operation with brokerage Sparebank 1 Markets and become its dominant owner, SMN said in a statement on Monday.

Following a share-based transaction and a 65 million Norwegian crowns ($10.4 million) cash injection by the owners, the bank's stake in Sparebank 1 Markets will rise to 73.3 percent from previously 27 percent. "The operations of the two companies will primarily continue as-is, with 70 employees in Oslo and 40 employees in Trondheim," SMN said, adding that Sparebank 1 Markets had recently cut its costs in half after years of steep losses. "The merged company will be profitable based on current combined income level. Fully integrated with the markets operation of SpareBank 1 SMN, SpareBank 1 Markets will increase its capacity and increase its spectre of services," SMN said. Meanwhile, Sparebank 1 Nord-Norge's stake will fall to 10 percent from 27 percent, and Sparebanken Hedmark's stake is set to drop to 6.1 percent from 16.6 percent. Samspar, a union of smaller savings banks, will cut its stake to 10 percent from 27. SpareBank 1 Markets recorded a loss of 69 million crowns in the first half of 2014 after restructuring costs of 40 million. Trading losses constituted 17 million crowns, SMN said.
