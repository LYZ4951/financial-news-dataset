MUMBAI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose nearly 1 percent on Monday to snap a three-day losing streak after auto stocks such as Mahindra and Mahindra <MAHM.NS> surged on healthy earnings, while strength in global shares on easing tensions over Ukraine also helped.

Global stocks bounced back after recent sell-offs as markets saw a lowered risk of direct conflict between Russia and Ukraine while Middle East tensions appeared less acute. [MKTS/GLOB] Foreign investors sold shares worth 5.03 billion rupees on Friday, provisional exchange data showed. June factory output and July retail inflation data due on Tuesday and wholesale inflation on Thursday, will also be watched for gauging the near term direction.

So, expect the rally to continue," said Dipen Shah, head of private client group research at Kotak Securities. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> rose 0.76 percent, or 57.40 points, to end at 7,625.95, closing above its technically important 50-day moving average at 7,616.74. The benchmark BSE index <.BSESN> rose 0.75 percent, or 190.10 points, to end at 25,519.24. Traders cited little impact from the Reserve Bank of India's board meeting in Delhi on Sunday. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was seen giving conditional support to the central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan's goal of bringing down inflation, even as the government is putting emphasis on stronger economic growth.
