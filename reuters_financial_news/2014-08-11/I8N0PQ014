MUMBAI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - India's NSE index rose nearly 1 percent on Monday to snap a three-day losing streak after auto stocks such as Mahindra and Mahindra <MAHM.NS> surged on earnings optimism, while strength in global shares on easing tensions in Ukraine also helped.

Mahindra and Mahindra provisionally rose 6.2 percent after its April-June earnings beat estimates on Friday, while Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> ended 3.3 percent higher, ahead of its earnings later in the day. The broader NSE index <.NSEI> provisionally rose 0.76 percent to close above its technically important 50-day moving average at 7,616.74.
