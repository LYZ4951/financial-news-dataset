SHANGHAI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - China's Qingdao city in Shandong province will issue a total of 2.5 billion yuan ($406.32 million) of five-, seven- and 10-year municipal bonds on Monday, according to an announcement on a website for major Chinese bond issues (www.chinabond.com.cn).

Qingdao is the first city government to issue this kind of bond, while all previous issuers have been from province-level government issuers. The Ministry of Finance said in late May that 10 local governments had been given quotas to issue a combined 109.2 billion yuan of municipal bonds this year.

Governments in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, Qingdao, Ningxia and Jiangxi are included in the pilot scheme. [ID:nL3N0O710I]
