STOCKHOLM, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The head of Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority said on Monday he was worried by the rising trend of household lending in Sweden, and that the regulator is looking at possible amortisation requirements and at limiting floating mortgages.

"Of course, we are worried. It's ticking up a bit and therefore we will look at it," Martin Andersson told journalists when asked about the recent trend of household borrowing.
