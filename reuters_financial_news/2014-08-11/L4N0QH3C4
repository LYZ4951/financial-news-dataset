Aug 11 (Reuters) - BlueBay Asset Management LLP, part of Royal Bank of Canada's  <RY.TO> asset management business, said it appointed Kaspar Hense as a portfolio manager in its investment grade team.

Hense will be responsible for the team's global sovereign and aggregate bond strategies.

BlueBay's investment grade business managed nearly $30 billion in assets as of June.
