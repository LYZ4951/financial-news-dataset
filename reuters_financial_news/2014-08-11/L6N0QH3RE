MILAN, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Small Italian cooperative lender Banca Popolare dell'Etruria e del Lazio is planning to become a joint-stock company to help it find a merger partner after the collapse of talks with bigger rival Popolare di Vicenza.

In a statement on Monday, the bank said its board had given a mandate to Chairman Lorenzo Rosi to look at transforming the bank into a joint stock company "in the next few months" to make it more attractive also for institutional investors, such as investment funds. It said it had picked investment bank Mediobanca <MDBI.MI> to help it find a partner, also at the international level.
