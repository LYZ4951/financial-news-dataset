ZURICH, Aug 11 (Reuters) - State-backed Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> is preparing to offload the international arm of its private bank, separating it from the UK unit, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The British bank has attracted a variety of offers from a range of bidders for Coutts International, including undisclosed Asian and North American parties for a business which manages roughly 40 billion Swiss francs ($44.2 billion) in client assets, the source said. There is a long list of attractive parties for the international arm, the source said, which is part of a 320-year-old bank. The international unit, which employs 1,200 staff, has cut the number of countries it serves dramatically in a roughly three-year restructuring. The move means RBS plans to maintain the British private bank, which counts the Queen among its clients. A spokeswoman for RBS declined to comment on the news on Monday. In the past, RBS has said Coutts will sit within its commercial and private bank, in order to better connect it with the wealthy entrepreneurs and other potential clients.  "As part of the transition and integration of this business, we have been reviewing our private banking business so that it works for the benefit of our customers," RBS said last week. Last year, Coutts International's operating profit stood at 103 million francs when stripping out provisions, including for a U.S. tax crackdown. The Swiss arm of Coutts is one of 100-plus Swiss banks who have reason to believe they may have committed tax offences by helping wealthy Americans evade taxes - and are eligible for a non-prosecution agreement if they come clean and face fines.
