LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest airport Heathrow said July was its busiest month on record with 6.97 million passengers travelling through the airport, 0.5 percent more than in the same month last year.

Heathrow, situated west of London, is operating close to capacity, and is at the centre of a long-running political tussle over airport expansion in the south-east of England. Paassenger traffic with China grew 10.4 percent in July, the airport said.
