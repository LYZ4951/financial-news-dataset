BANGALORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Banks will repay 4 billion euros next week of the long-term loans they took from the European Central Bank, slightly less than what they will pay back this week, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.

The ECB loaned banks a little over one trillion euros in December 2011 and February 2012 at the peak of the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, to avert a credit crunch and save the currency bloc. Banks are repaying those crisis loans early as they go through the final stages of the ECB's Europe-wide health checks. The outstanding amount of the two loans is down to 368.9 billion euros, including this week's repayments of 4.15 billion euros.
