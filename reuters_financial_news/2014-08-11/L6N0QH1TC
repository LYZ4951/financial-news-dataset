CAIRO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound <EGP=> remained stable at a central bank dollar sale on Monday and on the black market.

The central bank said it sold $39.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1401 pounds <CBEO> per dollar, unchanged from its last sale on Thursday. The rate for the dollar sales has stayed within a very tight range since the beginning of June, after the bank allowed the pound to weaken in May. It had offered $40 million on Monday. On the black market, the dollar changed hands for 7.39 pounds, one trader said, the same as on Thursday.
