SEOUL, Aug 11 (Reuters) - South Korea's shares and currency both rose on Monday, buoyed by Wall Street's rally on a dialling-back of tensions in Ukraine, although gains were limited by the longer-term global political outlook.

The benchmark KOSPI <.KS11> rose 0.41 percent to 2,039.37 points although foreign investors were net sellers of local shares worth 32.16 billion won ($31.21 million) as they remained cautious on the longer-term outlook.
