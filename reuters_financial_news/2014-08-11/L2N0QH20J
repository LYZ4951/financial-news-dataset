NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - HighTower Advisors, the Chicago-based broker-dealer, said on Monday it hired three advisers away from Bank of America's <BAC.N> Merrill Lynch office in Fort Myers, Florida.

Pamela Abraham, Jack Thomas and Trevor Swartz officially started at HighTower on Friday after resigning from Merrill Lynch, where they managed $800 million in client assets. All three brokers previously worked in the same office at Merrill. However, Thomas and Swartz worked as partners, and Abraham worked separately.  Abraham, a 33-year veteran of the industry, said the three teamed up because they all wanted the freedom to take a more individual approach with their clients, using their own style and financial product platforms, and she felt that was no longer possible at large brokerages like Merrill. "The freedom I once enjoyed to do whatever was best for my client has been challenged by numerous rules and regulations, and I think that's true across the industry," Abraham said.  The three opened a new office for HighTower in Fort Myers.
