TORONTO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts continued to edge up in July, surpassing economists' expectations for a decline, while the previous month was revised slightly higher, data showed on Monday.

A report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp showed the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts rose to 200,098 last month from a upwardly revised 198,665 units in June.
