COPENHAGEN, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Aurgia Industries <AURIb.CO> changed the date for issuing its quarterly results, a move that is rare amongst Danish companies, but said that had nothing to do with the potential sale of its crop protection unit, Cheminova.

Aurgia said late on Sunday it would announce its second quarter results on Aug. 14 rather than the initially planned Aug. 19. "There is no relation (to the sales process)," Investor Relations Manager Lene Faurskov told Reuters on Monday. "According to stock exchange rules we must publish earnings reports when they are ready. Because of that the board of directors has moved the scheduled meeting." Auriga said in June it would review its strategic options and, two weeks ago, said it was studying options to sell Cheminova. Sources told Reuters last month bankers were working on debt financing of up to 720 million euros ($964.30 million) to back the potential sale of Cheminova. The banking sources said Aurgia hired JP Morgan to help. [ID:nL6N0Q557M] Private equity firms Bain, CVC and EQT and Israel-based peer crop protection company Adama Agricultural Solutions have been mentioned by sources as bidders. Auriga Industries has a market capitalisation of 5.2 billion Danish crowns ($934 million).  (1 US dollar = 5.5650 Danish crown)
