Aug 11 (Reuters) - Hedge fund ValueAct Capital LLC has taken a $1 billion stake in Rupert Murdoch-controlled film and TV company Twenty-First Century Fox Inc <FOXA.O>, CNBC reported.

ValueAct built its position when Fox was seeking to buy Time Warner Inc <TWX.N>, CNBC's David Faber said. (http://reut.rs/1lOUuJ9) Fox withdrew its $80 billion bid to buy Time Warner last week after being rebuffed by the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros studios. [ID:nL4N0QB61J] Faber said ValueAct Chief Executive Jeffrey Ubben had told him he "loves" Fox's standalone plan.
