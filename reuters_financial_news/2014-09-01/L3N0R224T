BANGKOK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Thai shares rose on Monday as investors bought banking stocks amid economic optimism after the formation of an interim cabinet, while Philippine company SM Prime Holdings <SMPH.PS> rebounded from a two-week low hit on Friday after the announcement of a project.

Thailand's military ruler General Prayuth Chan-ocha has named the interim cabinet dominated by members of the security forces to govern the country through at least a year of political reforms before he permits an election.

Bangkok Bank Pcl <BBL.BK> jumped 2.4 percent to a near one-year high, while Siam Commercial Bank <SCB.BK> was up 1.6 percent.
