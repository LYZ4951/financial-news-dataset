MUMBAI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - India's NSE index surged past the psychologically important 8,000 level for the first time to mark its latest record high as blue-chips such as Larsen & Toubro <LART.NS> gained after better than expected quarterly economic growth data.

The after-glow of Narendra Modi's election victory nearly four months ago helped India's lumbering economy register its fastest growth in two-and-a-half years for the quarter ending in June, according to data on Friday. [ID:nL3N0QZ3WN] The 50-shares broader index rose as much as 0.67 percent to mark a record high of 8,007.95. Markets were closed on Friday for a holiday.
