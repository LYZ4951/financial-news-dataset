LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco <IMT.L> has closed loans of about $13 billion to back its acquisition of selected brands and assets from Reynolds American Inc <RAI.N>, the lead banks said on Monday.

The jumbo financing covers the $7.1 billion acquisition and refinances Imperial's existing core bank borrowings, which provide working capital and funds for general corporate purposes. Fourteen banks joined underwriters, mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners on the financing: BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA>, Royal Bank of Scotland <RBS.L> and Banco Santander <SAN.MC>.  The deal closed oversubscribed and all the banks' commitments were scaled back. Mandated lead arrangers joining the financing were BBVA <BBVA.MC>, Bank of America Merrill Lynch <BAC.N>, Bank of China <601988.SS>, Barclays Bank <BARC.L>, Commerzbank <CBKG.DE>, Credit Agricole CIB <CAGR.PA>, HSBC Bank <HSBA.L>, Intesa Sanpaolo <ISP.MI>, Mizuho Bank <8411.T>, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp <8316.T>, Societe Generale <SOGN.PA>, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Unicredit Bank <CRDI.MI>.
