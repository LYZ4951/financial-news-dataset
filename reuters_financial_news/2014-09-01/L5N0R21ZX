LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Bankers are working on debt financing packages of around 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) to back a potential sale of Norway's second-biggest cable operator Get, banking sources said on Monday.

GS Capital Partners and Quadrangle bought Get, previously known as UPC Norge, in 2007 for around $1.1 billion, backed with 3.71 billion Norwegian crowns ($600 million) of debt.   They considered selling the company in 2012 but opted to reshuffle Get's debt instead and raise a new loan to fund a dividend payment, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. The two owners have launched a sale process in tandem with preparations for an initial pubic offering (IPO).  Get expects to receive binding offers from Denmark's TDC and private equity funds BC Partners and EQT by a bid deadline of Sept. 11, in a sale that could value the company at around 1.4 billion euros, sources familiar with the matter have said.  [ID:nL5N0QZ4W5] Bankers are working on debt financing packages to back a potential sale. At around 1 billion euros, they would total 6.5 to 7 times Get's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of approximately 150 million euros, the bankers said.  Bankers are considering senior leveraged loans, second lien loans and high-yield bonds to back a deal, the bankers said.  The deal will be welcomed by bankers and cash-rich institutional investors eager to put money to work, especially for so-called event driven financings.  Get provides cable TV, high-speed broadband internet and telephony services to residential customers in Norway.  (1 US dollar = 0.7609 euro)
