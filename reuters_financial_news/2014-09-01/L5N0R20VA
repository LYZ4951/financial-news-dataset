LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - European shares kicked off September a touch higher on Monday, helped by some mergers and acquisitions speculation and expectations of new monetary largesse in Europe.

British broadcaster ITV <ITV.L> rose 2.5 percent after The Telegraph reported Liberty Global Plc <LBTYA.O> was canvassing support from major ITV shareholders following its acquisition this summer of a 6.4 percent stake, raising speculation of a full takeover bid. [ID:nL3N0R10QM] The stock was among top gainers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>, which was up 0.3 percent at 1,377.23 points by 0704 GMT.
