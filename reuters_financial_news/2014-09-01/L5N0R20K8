DUBAI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The emirate of Sharjah will arrange investor meetings this week and next ahead of its potential debut sovereign sukuk issue, the director of its debt management office told Reuters on Monday.

"It will be U.S. dollar, ijara structure. It is going to be benchmark sized," Tom Koczwara said, adding that the final size and tenor will be determined later. Benchmark size is usually understood to be worth upwards of $500 million.
