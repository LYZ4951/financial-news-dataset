HONG KONG, Sept 1 (Reuters) - China shares rose on Monday as gains in defence and media firms helped to offset a lower-than-expected official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) that added to signs of softness in the economy.

China's official PMI slipped from a 27-month high to 51.1 in August, the government said on Monday, spurring new calls for more policy easing to prevent the economy from stumbling once more.

Defence stocks were the key outperformers again after Friday, bolstered by President Xi Jinping's comment that China will spur military innovation.
