MANILA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - SM Prime Holdings Inc <SMPH.PS>, one of the Philippines' biggest property companies, plans to spend 100 billion pesos ($2.29 billion) to develop a 2.3 square mile land reclamation project along Manila Bay, company officials said on Monday.

SM Prime is working with global engineering giant AECOM Technology Corp <ACM.N> on the project, which involves two large-scale reclamation contracts won separately from Parañaque and Pasay cities, both part of the greater Manila area. SM Prime is owned by the country's richest man, Henry Sy, Sr."In three to six months, we should be able to come out with a master plan," SM Prime President Hans Sy told reporters. He said the plan, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will address environmental and climate change issues. It will take three to five years to reclaim land for the project which will sit alongside Manila Bay. It will be located near the 0.46 square mile Entertainment City where casino-resort projects are currently being built by companies such as Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd <6883.HK> and Belle Corp <BEL.PS>, Universal Entertainment Corp's <6425.T> Tiger Resorts & Leisure Corp, and Genting Hong Kong Ltd <0678.HK> with Alliance Global Group Inc <AGI.PS>.  Bloomberry Resorts Corp <BLOOM.PS> is the first to operate a casino-resort in Entertainment City. The cities of Parañaque and Pasay need to secure regulatory approvals for the project from government agencies such as the Philippine Reclamation Authority and the National Economic and Development Authority, according to SM Prime's Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey Lim. Shares of SM Prime, which raised 20 billion pesos through its maiden bond issuance last week, were up 1.5 percent at 16.4 pesos, overtaking the benchmark index <.PSI> which rose 0.4 percent as of 0331 GMT.
