DUBAI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Viva Kuwait, the country's second biggest mobile phone operator by subscribers, plans to list on the Kuwait Stock Exchange by year-end, nearly six years after it completed an initial public offer of shares, the company's chairman said on Monday.

The comments by Adel Mohammad al-Roumi were carried on Kuwait's state news agency KUNA and followed a statement from the company on Sunday that Viva Kuwait, an affiliate of Saudi Telecom Co <7010.SE>, had received regulatory approval to join the market.  The company never publicly explained the delay in listing. The global financial crisis appeared to play a role; from its June 2008 peak, Kuwait's main stock index <.KWSE> plunged nearly 60 percent to February 2009, and it remains about 53 percent below that high.  The saga also underlined the complex and sometimes unpredictable regulatory environment in Kuwait; periodically during the last six years the company said it was preparing to list, but the listing never happened. Viva Kuwait raised 25 million dinars ($87.9 million) from selling half its shares to Kuwaiti nationals in its IPO in September 2008, beginning services later that year. It has since thrived, and had a 33 percent share of Kuwait's mobile subscribers at the end of June. Rival Zain <ZAIN.KW> had 36 percent and Ooredoo <ORDS.QA> subsidiary Wataniya <OORE.KW> had 31 percent, according to Zain's earnings report. Viva Kuwait made a net profit of 24.3 million dinars for 2013, up from 3.87 million dinars a year earlier. Viva valued its total assets at 178.99 million dinars at the end of 2013, according to its annual report.
