MUMBAI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - India's NSE index surged past the psychologically important 8,000 level for the first time on Monday to mark its latest record high as blue-chips such as ICICI Bank <ICBK.NS> gained after better-than-expected quarterly economic growth data.

The 50-shares broader index <.NSEI> rose nearly 1.01 percent to mark a record high of 8,035.00, surpassing its previous all-time high hit on Aug. 25, while the BSE index <.BSESN> rose as much as 1 percent to mark its second consecutive record high at 26,900.30. ICICI Bank provisionally gained 2.9 percent, while Larsen and Toubro <LART.NS> rose 3.4 percent.
