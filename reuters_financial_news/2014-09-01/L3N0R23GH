NEW DELHI, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Indian developer Brigade Enterprises <BRIG.NS> and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL] have agreed to jointly invest 15 billion rupees ($248 million) in residential real estate projects in south India, the companies said.

Brigade and GIC will invest in acquiring land and building homes and for mixed-use projects, the companies said in a statement on Monday. Sovereign wealth funds and other long-term investors are eyeing opportunities in India's real estate sector, as property prices continue to drop on the back of the slowest economic growth in a decade for the country. India last month paved the way for the setting up of real estate investment trusts (REITs), a move to boost foreign investment in the property sector. [ID:nL4N0QG0AO] Funds, including the Blackstone Group <BX.N>, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), are among those seeking to invest in the Indian property market.
