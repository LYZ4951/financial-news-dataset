HONG KONG, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's benchmark index failed to hold onto midday gains on Monday, hurt by a weaker gambling sector after data showed Macau casino revenue declined for the third straight month in August.

The Hang Seng Index <.HSI> closed barely changed at 24,752.09 points. The China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also ended flat.  Macau casinos extended losses in the afternoon, with Galaxy Entertainment Group <0027.HK> and Sands China <1928.HK> both down about 3 percent.  Gambling revenue in the world's biggest gaming hub fell 6.1 percent in August from a year earlier, as a stepped-up campaign against corruption and falling housing prices in China cut business from high-rolling VIP customers.
