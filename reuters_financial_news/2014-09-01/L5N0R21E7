LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Neil Woodford, one of Britain's most high-profile fund managers, said he has sold his fund's stake in banking group HSBC <HSBA.L>, citing concerns over the potential impact on the company of several industry-wide probes.

"In particular, I am worried that the ongoing investigation into the historic manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets could expose HSBC to significant financial penalties," he said in a blog posting on his fund's website. "Not only are these potentially serious offences in the eyes of the regulator, but HSBC is very able to pay a substantial fine." Woodford, a favourite among investors due to his strong performance track record, said the size of any potential fine was unquantifiable and therefore represented an unquantifiable risk. "Nevertheless, a substantial fine could hamper HSBC's ability to grow its dividend, in my view. I have therefore sold the fund's position in HSBC, reinvesting the proceeds into parts of the portfolio in which I have greater conviction," he added. CF Woodford Equity Income Fund had 2.68 percent of its assets in HSBC shares at the end of July, according to the fund's factsheet.
